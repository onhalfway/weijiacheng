<p>'The Ugly Duckling' is one of <strong>Danish</strong> <strong>storyteller</strong> Hans Christian Andersen's most famous <strong>fairytales</strong>. With a powerful message about <strong>self-image</strong> (自我形象) and <strong>acceptance</strong> (接纳), the story is valued for its ability to teach children the importance of <strong>kindness</strong> to others. This lesson gives you a brief plot summary and analysis, discusses the story's major characters, and finishes with a quiz to test your knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-the-ugly-duckling">Introduction to the Ugly Duckling</h2>
<p>Think of a time in your life when you felt <strong>left out</strong> or different; maybe you were the new kid in your school or your neighborhood, or the only person of your cultural background in your class. Maybe you can remember being <strong>teased</strong> for wearing glasses or braces, or for not being the best at <strong>kickball</strong>. These are all <strong>life experiences</strong> that teach us important lessons about <strong>acceptance and kindness towards</strong> others, and one of the most famous examples of such a lesson in children's <strong>literature</strong> is Danish storyteller Hans Christian Anderson's fairytale 'The Ugly Duckling,' published in 1843.</p>
<h2 id="story-summary">Story Summary</h2>
<p>The story tells of a <strong>plain-looking</strong> little bird (the Ugly Duckling) born in a <strong>barnyard</strong>. His brothers and sisters <strong>as well as</strong> the other birds and animals on the farm <strong>tease</strong> him for being <strong>plain and ugly</strong>, so he <strong>runs off</strong> to live with a <strong>flock</strong> of wild ducks and geese until hunters <strong>shoot down</strong> the flock. Alone again, the Ugly Duckling finds a home with an old woman, but her cat and hen also tease him, so he doesn't stay there long.</p>
<p>In his <strong>wanderings</strong>, the Ugly Duckling <strong>comes across</strong> a flock of migrating <strong>swans</strong>, and he wishes to join them but can't because he's too young and can't fly well enough. When winter <strong>sets in</strong>, a farmer <strong>rescues</strong> the Ugly Duckling, but the farmer's children and other animals <strong>frighten</strong> him with their noise and teasing, so again, he <strong>flees</strong>. He spends a cold and lonely winter hiding in a <strong>cave</strong> until <strong>springtime</strong>, when the flock of swans comes to the lake near his hiding place.</p>
<p>When the Ugly Duckling <strong>approaches</strong> the swans, he's <strong>delighted</strong> to find that they <strong>accept</strong> him and treat him like one of them. When he looks at his <strong>reflection</strong> in the lake, he <strong>realizes</strong>, to his <strong>astonishment</strong>, that he's <strong>matured</strong> into a beautiful swan himself. When the swans <strong>fly off</strong> from the lake, he <strong>spreads</strong> his wings and joins them, finally having found a family who accepts him.</p>
<h2 id="story-analysis">Story Analysis</h2>
<p>'The Ugly Duckling' is a popular story about <strong>personal transformation</strong> (转化) and <strong>self-image</strong>. It is sometimes said that Anderson wrote the story based on his own experiences as a boy, being teased for the shape of his nose and facial features and for his <strong>social awkwardness</strong>. However, like the Ugly Duckling's transformation from plain to beautiful, Anderson <strong>grew up</strong> to be a world-famous author.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristic</strong> of the fairytale story, Anderson's tale shows a character <strong>overcoming</strong> a <strong>challenge</strong> and <strong>miraculously</strong> arriving at a happy ending. The Ugly Duckling's transformation might not be magical in the same way we think of magic in stories like 'Cinderella'; there's no fairy <strong>godmother</strong> waving a <strong>wand</strong> to make the Ugly Duckling beautiful, but the magic is in his <strong>self-discovery</strong> and how much being loved and accepted <strong>alters</strong> his appearance <strong>as much as</strong> his <strong>natural</strong> growing up.</p>
<p>Part of the duckling's <strong>struggle</strong> comes from the <strong>treatment</strong> he receives from others, but also from the fact that he simply accepts their <strong>perception</strong> of him and doesn't realize, until he gets a good look at himself, how truly beautiful and wonderful he is. While he transforms into a beautiful swan on the outside, the real transformation <strong>occurs</strong> inside him; only when he finds a group who accepts him at <strong>face-value</strong> does he have the <strong>courage</strong> to examine his own <strong>reflection</strong>. The <strong>moral</strong> of the story teaches us to accept <strong>one another</strong> <strong>no matter</strong> how different we might appear.</p></div>
