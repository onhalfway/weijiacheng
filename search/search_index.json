Many years ago / Long ago / Once upon a time, there lived an emperor, who cared so enormously for becautiful new clothes that he spent all his money upon them, that he might be very fine. He did not care about his soldiers, nor about the theatre, nor about driving in the park except to show his new clothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day; and just as they say of a king,\u201c He is in council, \u201d one always said of him, \u201c The emperor is in the wardrobe.\u201d In the great city in which he lived it was always very merry; every day a number of strangers arrived there. One day two cheats came: they gave themselves out as weavers, and declared that they could weave the finest stuff anyone could imagine. Not only were their colours and patterns, they said, uncommonly beautiful, but the clothes made of the stuff possessed the wonderful quality that they became invisible to anyone who was unfit for the office he held, or was incorrigibly stupid. \u201cThose would be capital clothes!\u201d thought the emperor.\u201cIf I wore those, I should be able to find out what men in my empire are not fit for the places they have; I could distinguish the clever from the stupid. Yes, the stuff must be woven for me directly! \u201d And he gave the two cheats a great deal of cash in hand, that they might begin their work at once. As for them, they put up two looms, and pretended to working; but they had nothing at all on their looms. They at once demanded the finest silk and the costliest gold; this they put into their own pockets, and worked at the empty looms till late into the night. \u201cI should like to know how far they have got on with the stuff,\u201d thoght the emperor. But he felt quite uncomfortable when he thought that those who were not fit for their offices could not see it. He believed, indeed, that he had nothing to fear for himself, but yet he prefered first to send some one else to see how matters stood. All the people in the whole city knew what peculiar power the stuff possessed, and all were anxious to see how bad or how stupid their neighbours were. \u201cI will send my honest old minister to the weavers, \u201d thought the emperor.\u201cHe can judge best how the stuff looks, for he has sense, and no one discharges his office better than he.\u201d Now the good old minister went out ino the hall where the two cheats sat working at the empty looms. \u201cMercy preserve us!\u201d thought the old minister, and he opened his eyes wide. \u201cI cannot see anything at all!\u201d But he did not say this. Bothe the cheats begged him to be kind enough to come nearer, and asked if he did not approve of the colours and the pattern. Then they pointed to the empty loom, and the poor old minister went on opening his eyes; but he could see nothing, for there was nothing to see. \u201cMercy!\u201d thought he, \u201ccan I indeed be so stupid? I never thought that, and not a sould must know it. Am I not fit for my office?\uff0dNo, it wil never do for me to tell that I could not see the stuff.\u201d \u201cDo you say nothing to it?\u201d said one of the weavers. \u201cOh, it is charming\uff0dquite enchanting!\u201d answered the old minister, as he peered through his spectacles. \u201cWhat a fine pattern, and what colours! Yes, I shall tell the emperor that I am very much pleased with it.\u201d \u201cWell, we are glad for that, \u201dsaid both the weavers; and then they named the colours, and explained the strange pattern. The old minister listened attentively, that he might be able to repeat it when he went back to the emperor. And he did so. Now the cheats asked for more money, and more silk and gold, which they declared they wanted for weaving. They put all into their own pockets, and not a thread was put upon the loom; but they continued to work at the empty frames as before. The emperor soon sent again, dispatching another honest statesman, to see how the weaving was going on, and if the stuff would soon be ready. He fared just like the first: he looked and looked, but, as there was nothing to be seen but the empty looms, he could see nothing. \u201cIs not that a pretty piece of stuff?\u201d asked the two cheats; and they displayed and explained the handsome pattern which was not there at all. \u201cI am not stupid!\u201d thought the man\uff0d\u201cit must be my good office, for which I am not fit. It is funny enough, but I must not let it be noticed.\u201d And so he praised the stuff which he did not see, and expressed his pleasure at the beautiful colours and the charming pattern. \u201cYes, it is enchanting, \u201d he said to the emperor. All the people in the town were talking of the gorgeous stuff. The emperor wished to see if himself while it was still upon the loom. With a whole crowd of chosen men, among whom were also the two honest statesmen who had already been there, he went to the two cunning cheats, who were now weaving with might and main without fibre or thread. \u201cIs that not splendid?\u201d said the two old statesmen, who had already been there once.\u201c Does not your majesty remark the pattern and the colours?\u201d And then they pointed to the empty loom, for they thought that the others could see the stuff. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d thought the emperor. \u201cI can see nothing at all! That is terrible. Am I stupid? Am I not fit to be emperor? That would be the most dreadful thing that could happen to me.\u201d \u201cOh, it is very pretty!\u201d he said aloud. \u201cIt has our exalted approbation.\u201dAnd he nodded in a contented way, and gazed at the empty loom, for he would not say that he saw nothing. The whole suite whom he had with him looked and looked, and saw nothing, any more than the rest; but, like the emperor, they said,\u201cThat is pretty!\u201d and counselled him to wear these splendid new clothes for the first time at the great procession that was presently to take place.\u201cIt is splendid, tasteful, excellent!\u201d went from mouth to mouth. On all sides there seemed to be general rejoicing, and the emperor gave each of the cheats a cross to hang at his button-hole and the title of Imperial Court Weaver. The whole night before the morning on which the procession was to take place the cheats were up, and had lighted more than sixteen candles. The people could see that they were hard at work, completing the emperor\u2019s new clothes. They pretended to take the stuff down from the loom; they made cuts in the air with great scissors; they sewed with needles without thread; and at last they said,\u201cNow the clothes are ready.\u201d The emperor came himself with his noblest cavaliers; and the two cheats lifted up one arm as if they were holding something, and said, \u201cSee, here are the trousers! Here is the coat! Here is the cloak!\u201d and so on. \u201cIt is as light as a spider\u2019s web: one would think one had nothing on; but that is just the beauty of it.\u201d \u201cYes, \u201d said all the cavaliers; but they could not see anything, for nothing was there. \u201cDoes your imperial majesty please to condescend to undress?\u201d said the cheats; \u201cthen we will put you on the new clothes here in front of the great mirror.\u201d The emperor took off his clothes, and the cheats pretended to put on him each of the new garments, and they took him round the waist, and seemed to fasten on something; that was the train; and the emperor turned round and round before the mirror. \u201cOh, how well they look! How capitally they fit!\u201d said all. \u201cWhat a pattern! What colours! That is a splendid dress!\u201d \u201cThey are standing outside with the canopy which is to be borne above your majesty in the procession!\u201d announced the head master of the ceremonies. \u201cWell, I am ready, \u201dreplied the emperor.\u201cDoes it not suit me well?\u201d And then he turned again to the mirror, for he wanted it to appear as if he contemplated his adornment with great interest. The chamberlains, who were to carry the train, stooped down with their hands towards the floor, just as if they were picking up the mantle; then they pretended to be holding something up in the air. They did not dare to let it be noticed that they saw nothing. So the emperor went in procession under the rich canopy, and every one in the streets said, \u201c How incomparable are the emperor\u2019s new clothes! What a train he has to his mantle! How it fits him! \u201d No one would let it be perceived that he could see nothing, for that would have shown that he was not fit for his office, or was very stupid. No clothes of the emperor\u2019s had ever had such a success as these. \u201cBut he has nothing on!\u201d a little child cried out at last. \u201cJust hear what that innocent says!\u201d said the father and one whispered to another what the child had said. \u201c There is a little child that says he has nothing on.\u201d \u201cBut he has nothing on!\u201d said the whole people at length. And the emperor shivered, for it seemed to him that they were right; but he thought within himself. \u201cI must go through with the procession.\u201d And so he carried himself still more proudly, and the chamberlains held on tighter than ever, and carried the train which did not exist at all.","title":"The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes"},{"location":"toc/english/New-Clothes/#the-emperors-new-clothes","text":"\u7687\u5e1d\u7684\u65b0\u88c5\uff0c\u662f\u4e39\u9ea6\u8457\u540d\u7ae5\u8bdd\u4f5c\u5bb6\u5b89\u5f92\u751f\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u4f5c\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u7ae5\u8bdd\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u63cf\u7ed8\u4e86\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u4e2a\u6545\u4e8b\uff1a\u4e00\u4f4d\u5962\u4f88\u7684\u56fd\u738b\u6bcf\u5929\u53ea\u987e\u7740\u7a7f\u8863\u670d\uff0c\u4e0d\u7ba1\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u4f55\u4e8b\uff0c\u540e\u7adf\u7136\u8fd8\u53d7\u9a97\uff0c\u4ec0\u4e48\u90fd\u6ca1\u7a7f\u53bb\u6e38\u884c\uff01\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba\u53bb\u63ed\u7a7f\u8c0e\u8a00\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8fd8\u5938\u8000\uff0c\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b69\u5b50\u5929\u771f\u7684\u4e00\u53e5\u8bdd\u624d\u7ed3\u675f\u4e86\u8fd9\u573a\u95f9\u5267\u3002 Many years ago / Long ago / Once upon a time, there lived an emperor, who cared so enormously for becautiful new clothes that he spent all his money upon them, that he might be very fine. He did not care about his soldiers, nor about the theatre, nor about driving in the park except to show his new clothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day; and just as they say of a king,\u201c He is in council, \u201d one always said of him, \u201c The emperor is in the wardrobe.\u201d In the great city in which he lived it was always very merry; every day a number of strangers arrived there. One day two cheats came: they gave themselves out as weavers, and declared that they could weave the finest stuff anyone could imagine. Not only were their colours and patterns, they said, uncommonly beautiful, but the clothes made of the stuff possessed the wonderful quality that they became invisible to anyone who was unfit for the office he held, or was incorrigibly stupid. \u201cThose would be capital clothes!\u201d thought the emperor.\u201cIf I wore those, I should be able to find out what men in my empire are not fit for the places they have; I could distinguish the clever from the stupid. Yes, the stuff must be woven for me directly! \u201d And he gave the two cheats a great deal of cash in hand, that they might begin their work at once. As for them, they put up two looms, and pretended to working; but they had nothing at all on their looms.

The wind whistled so fiercely round the duckling that he had to sit on his tail to resist it, and it blew harder and harder; then he saw that the door had fallen off one hinge and hung so crookedly that he could creep into the house through the crack, and by this means he made his way into the room. An old woman lived there with her cat and her hen.

They were dazzlingly white with long waving necks; they were swans, and uttering a peculiar cry. They spread out their magnificent broad wings and flew away from the cold regions to warmer lands and open seas. They mounted so high, so high, so very high! The ugly little duckling became strangely uneasy; he circled round and round in the water like a wheel, craning his neck up into the air after them. Then he uttered a shriek so piercing and so strange, that he quite frightened himself. Oh, he could not forget those beautiful birds, those happy birds, and as soon as they were out of sight he ducked right down to the bottom, and when he came up again he was quite beside himself. He did not know what the birds were, or whither they flew, but all the sane he was more drawn towards them than he had ever been by any creatures before. He did not envy them in the least; how could it occur to him even to wish to be such a marvel of beauty? He would have been thankful if only the ducks would have tolerated him among them-the poor ugly creature! \u4e00\u5929\u665a\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f53\u592a\u9633\u6b63\u5728\u7f8e\u4e3d\u5730\u843d\u4e0b\u53bb\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6709\u4e00\u7fa4\u6f02\u4eae\u7684\u5927\u9e1f\u4ece\u704c\u6728\u6797\u91cc\u98de\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u5c0f\u9e2d\u4ece\u6765\u6ca1\u6709\u770b\u5230\u8fc7\u8fd9\u6837\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u767d\u5f97\u53d1\u4eae\uff0c\u9888\u9879\u53c8\u957f\u53c8\u67d4\u8f6f\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u5929\u9e45\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u53d1\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5947\u5f02\u7684\u53eb\u58f0\uff0c\u5c55\u5f00\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\u957f\u7fc5\u8180\uff0c\u4ece\u5bd2\u51b7\u7684\u5730\u5e26\u98de\u5411\u6e29\u6696\u7684\u56fd\u5ea6\uff0c\u98de\u5411\u4e0d\u7ed3\u51b0\u7684\u6e56\u4e0a\u53bb\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u98de\u5f97\u5f88\u9ad8\u2014\u2014\u90a3\u4e48\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e11\u5c0f\u9e2d\u4e0d\u7981\u611f\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u8bf4\u4e0d\u51fa\u7684\u5174\u594b\u3002\u4ed6\u5728\u6c34\u4e0a\u50cf\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f66\u8f6e\u4f3c\u5730\u4e0d\u505c\u5730\u65cb\u8f6c\u7740\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u628a\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u9888\u9879\u9ad8\u9ad8\u5730\u5411\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f38\u7740\uff0c\u53d1\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u54cd\u4eae\u7684\u602a\u53eb\u58f0\uff0c\u8fde\u4ed6\u81ea\u5df1\u4e5f\u5bb3\u6015\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u554a!\u4ed6\u518d\u4e5f\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e0d\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\u9e1f\u513f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e78\u798f\u7684\u9e1f\u513f\u3002\u5f53\u4ed6\u770b\u4e0d\u89c1\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u5c31\u6c89\u5165\u6c34\u5e95;\u4f46\u662f\u5f53\u4ed6\u518d\u5192\u5230\u6c34\u9762\u4e0a\u6765\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u5374\u611f\u5230\u975e\u5e38\u7a7a\u865a\u3002\u4ed6\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9e1f\u513f\u7684\u540d\u5b57\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4ed6\u4eec\u8981\u5411\u4ec0\u4e48\u5730\u65b9\u98de\u53bb\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4ed6\u7231\u4ed6\u4eec\uff0c\u597d\u50cf\u4ed6\u4ece\u6765\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u7231\u8fc7\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e1c\u897f\u4f3c\u7684\u3002\u4ed6\u5e76\u4e0d\u5ac9\u5992\u4ed6\u4eec\u3002\u4ed6\u600e\u80fd\u68a6\u60f3\u6709\u4ed6\u4eec\u90a3\u6837\u7f8e\u4e3d\u5462?\u53ea\u8981\u522b\u7684\u9e2d\u513f\u51c6\u8bb8\u4ed6\u8ddf\u4ed6\u4eec\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u4ed6\u5c31\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f88\u6ee1\u610f\u4e86\u2014\u2014\u53ef\u601c\u7684\u4e11\u4e1c\u897f\u3002 The winter was so bitterly cold that the duckling was obliged to swim about in the water to keep it from freezing, but every night the hole in which he swam got smaller and smaller.

There it soon revived. The children wanted to play with it, but the duckling thought they were going to abuse him, and rushed in his fright into the milk pan, and the milk spurted out all over the room. The woman shrieked and threw up her hands. The duckling flew into the butter cask, and down into the milk tub and out again. Just imagine what it looked like by this time!

Oh! the spring freshness was so delicious! \u5ffd\u7136\u95f4\u4ed6\u4e3e\u8d77\u7fc5\u8180\uff1a\u7fc5\u8180\u62cd\u8d77\u6765\u6bd4\u4ee5\u524d\u6709\u529b\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u9a6c\u4e0a\u5c31\u628a\u4ed6\u6258\u8d77\u6765\u98de\u8d70\u4e86\u3002\u4ed6\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e0d\u89c9\u5730\u5df2\u7ecf\u98de\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e00\u5ea7\u5927\u82b1\u56ed\u3002\u8fd9\u513f\u82f9\u679c\u6811\u6b63\u5f00\u7740\u82b1;\u7d2b\u4e01\u9999\u5728\u6563\u53d1\u7740\u9999\u6c14\uff0c\u5b83\u53c8\u957f\u53c8\u7eff\u7684\u679d\u6761\u5782\u5230\u5f2f\u5f2f\u66f2\u66f2\u7684\u6eaa\u6d41\u4e0a\u3002\u554a\uff0c\u8fd9\u513f\u7f8e\u4e3d\u6781\u4e86\uff0c\u5145\u6ee1\u4e86\u6625\u5929\u7684\u6c14\u606f!

Great dock leaves grew from the walls of the house right down to the water\u2019s edge; some of them were so tall that a small child could stand upright under them.

Her little ducklings were just about to be hatched, but she was nearly tired of sitting; it had lasted such a long time. Moreover, she had very few visitors, as the other ducks liked swimming about in the moat better than waddling up to sit under the dock leaves and gossip with her. \u7684\u786e\uff0c\u4e61\u95f4\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\uff0c\u592a\u9633\u5149\u6b63\u7167\u7740\u4e00\u5e62\u8001\u5f0f\u7684\u5b85\u7b2c\uff0c\u5b83\u5468\u56f4\u6d41\u7740\u4e00\u6761\u5f88\u6df1\u7684\u58d5\u6c9f\uff08\u6216\u5c0f\u6eaa\uff09\u3002\u4ece\u5899\u89d2\u90a3\u513f\u4e00\u76f4\u5230\u6c34\u91cc\uff0c\u5168\u76d6\u6ee1\u4e86\u725b\u84a1\u7684\u5927\u53f6\u5b50\u3002\u6700\u5927\u7684\u53f6\u5b50\u957f\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c0f\u5b69\u5b50\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u7740\u8170\u7ad9\u5728\u4e0b\u9762\u3002\u50cf\u5728\u6700\u6d53\u5bc6\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u91cc\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u8fd9\u513f\u4e5f\u662f\u5f88\u8352\u51c9\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u513f\u6709\u4e00\u53ea\u6bcd\u9e2d\u5750\u5728\u7aa0\u91cc\uff0c\u5979\u5f97\u628a\u5979\u7684\u51e0\u53ea\u5c0f\u9e2d\u4ed4\u90fd\u5b75\u51fa\u6765\u4e86\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u65f6\u5979\u5df2\u7ecf\u51e0\u4e4e\u8981\u7d2f\u574f\u4e86\u3002\u5f88\u5c11\u6709\u5ba2\u4eba\u6765\u770b\u5979\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u522b\u7684\u9e2d\u5b50\u90fd\u613f\u610f\u5728\u6eaa\u6d41\u91cc\u6e38\u6765\u6e38\u53bb\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u613f\u610f\u8dd1\u5230\u725b\u84a1\u4e0b\u9762\u6765\u548c\u5979\u804a\u5929\u3002 At last one egg after another began to crack. \u201cCheep, cheep!\u201d they said.

The wind whistled so fiercely round the duckling that he had to sit on his tail to resist it, and it blew harder and harder; then he saw that the door had fallen off one hinge and hung so crookedly that he could creep into the house through the crack, and by this means he made his way into the room. An old woman lived there with her cat and her hen.

They were dazzlingly white with long waving necks; they were swans, and uttering a peculiar cry. They spread out their magnificent broad wings and flew away from the cold regions to warmer lands and open seas. They mounted so high, so high, so very high! The ugly little duckling became strangely uneasy; he circled round and round in the water like a wheel, craning his neck up into the air after them. Then he uttered a shriek so piercing and so strange, that he quite frightened himself. Oh, he could not forget those beautiful birds, those happy birds, and as soon as they were out of sight he ducked right down to the bottom, and when he came up again he was quite beside himself. He did not know what the birds were, or whither they flew, but all the sane he was more drawn towards them than he had ever been by any creatures before. He did not envy them in the least; how could it occur to him even to wish to be such a marvel of beauty? He would have been thankful if only the ducks would have tolerated him among them-the poor ugly creature! \u4e00\u5929\u665a\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f53\u592a\u9633\u6b63\u5728\u7f8e\u4e3d\u5730\u843d\u4e0b\u53bb\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6709\u4e00\u7fa4\u6f02\u4eae\u7684\u5927\u9e1f\u4ece\u704c\u6728\u6797\u91cc\u98de\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u5c0f\u9e2d\u4ece\u6765\u6ca1\u6709\u770b\u5230\u8fc7\u8fd9\u6837\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u767d\u5f97\u53d1\u4eae\uff0c\u9888\u9879\u53c8\u957f\u53c8\u67d4\u8f6f\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u5929\u9e45\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u53d1\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5947\u5f02\u7684\u53eb\u58f0\uff0c\u5c55\u5f00\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\u957f\u7fc5\u8180\uff0c\u4ece\u5bd2\u51b7\u7684\u5730\u5e26\u98de\u5411\u6e29\u6696\u7684\u56fd\u5ea6\uff0c\u98de\u5411\u4e0d\u7ed3\u51b0\u7684\u6e56\u4e0a\u53bb\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u98de\u5f97\u5f88\u9ad8\u2014\u2014\u90a3\u4e48\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e11\u5c0f\u9e2d\u4e0d\u7981\u611f\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u8bf4\u4e0d\u51fa\u7684\u5174\u594b\u3002\u4ed6\u5728\u6c34\u4e0a\u50cf\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f66\u8f6e\u4f3c\u5730\u4e0d\u505c\u5730\u65cb\u8f6c\u7740\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u628a\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u9888\u9879\u9ad8\u9ad8\u5730\u5411\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f38\u7740\uff0c\u53d1\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u54cd\u4eae\u7684\u602a\u53eb\u58f0\uff0c\u8fde\u4ed6\u81ea\u5df1\u4e5f\u5bb3\u6015\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u554a!\u4ed6\u518d\u4e5f\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e0d\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\u9e1f\u513f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e78\u798f\u7684\u9e1f\u513f\u3002\u5f53\u4ed6\u770b\u4e0d\u89c1\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u5c31\u6c89\u5165\u6c34\u5e95;\u4f46\u662f\u5f53\u4ed6\u518d\u5192\u5230\u6c34\u9762\u4e0a\u6765\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u5374\u611f\u5230\u975e\u5e38\u7a7a\u865a\u3002\u4ed6\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9e1f\u513f\u7684\u540d\u5b57\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4ed6\u4eec\u8981\u5411\u4ec0\u4e48\u5730\u65b9\u98de\u53bb\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4ed6\u7231\u4ed6\u4eec\uff0c\u597d\u50cf\u4ed6\u4ece\u6765\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u7231\u8fc7\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e1c\u897f\u4f3c\u7684\u3002\u4ed6\u5e76\u4e0d\u5ac9\u5992\u4ed6\u4eec\u3002\u4ed6\u600e\u80fd\u68a6\u60f3\u6709\u4ed6\u4eec\u90a3\u6837\u7f8e\u4e3d\u5462?\u53ea\u8981\u522b\u7684\u9e2d\u513f\u51c6\u8bb8\u4ed6\u8ddf\u4ed6\u4eec\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u4ed6\u5c31\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f88\u6ee1\u610f\u4e86\u2014\u2014\u53ef\u601c\u7684\u4e11\u4e1c\u897f\u3002 The winter was so bitterly cold that the duckling was obliged to swim about in the water to keep it from freezing, but every night the hole in which he swam got smaller and smaller.

There it soon revived. The children wanted to play with it, but the duckling thought they were going to abuse him, and rushed in his fright into the milk pan, and the milk spurted out all over the room. The woman shrieked and threw up her hands. The duckling flew into the butter cask, and down into the milk tub and out again. Just imagine what it looked like by this time!

Oh! the spring freshness was so delicious! \u5ffd\u7136\u95f4\u4ed6\u4e3e\u8d77\u7fc5\u8180\uff1a\u7fc5\u8180\u62cd\u8d77\u6765\u6bd4\u4ee5\u524d\u6709\u529b\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u9a6c\u4e0a\u5c31\u628a\u4ed6\u6258\u8d77\u6765\u98de\u8d70\u4e86\u3002\u4ed6\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e0d\u89c9\u5730\u5df2\u7ecf\u98de\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e00\u5ea7\u5927\u82b1\u56ed\u3002\u8fd9\u513f\u82f9\u679c\u6811\u6b63\u5f00\u7740\u82b1;\u7d2b\u4e01\u9999\u5728\u6563\u53d1\u7740\u9999\u6c14\uff0c\u5b83\u53c8\u957f\u53c8\u7eff\u7684\u679d\u6761\u5782\u5230\u5f2f\u5f2f\u66f2\u66f2\u7684\u6eaa\u6d41\u4e0a\u3002\u554a\uff0c\u8fd9\u513f\u7f8e\u4e3d\u6781\u4e86\uff0c\u5145\u6ee1\u4e86\u6625\u5929\u7684\u6c14\u606f!
