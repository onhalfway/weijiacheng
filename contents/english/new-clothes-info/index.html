<h1 id="information-about-the-emperors-new-clothes"><a href="https://www.bookreports.info/the-emperors-new-clothes-summary/">Information About The Emperor’s New Clothes</a></h1>
<p><strong>Author</strong>: Hans Christian Andersen</p>
<p>“The Emperor’s new clothes” is a fun story about human <strong>vanity</strong> (虚荣心) and the fear of truth, wisdom, <strong>stupidity</strong>, <strong>naivety</strong> (天真) and <strong>incompetence</strong> (不胜任). It reminds us of the never-ending human desire for power, material things and good position in the society.</p>
<p>《皇帝的新衣》是一个关于人类虚荣心和对真理、智慧、愚蠢、天真和无能的恐惧的有趣故事。它让我们想起人类对权力、物质和社会地位的永无止境的渴望。</p>
<p>The main starter in the story is the Emperor’s weakest spot and that is clothes. The other starters of the plot are the <strong>conmen</strong> (conman /'kɔnmæn/老千, 骗子) who wanted to take advantage of the Emperor’s weak spot to earn money. The time is not specific but, as in all fairy tales, everything happens once upon a time in a castle.</p>
<p>故事的主要开头是皇帝的弱点，那就是衣服。其他开始的阴谋是骗子谁想利用皇帝的弱点赚钱。时间并不具体，但就像所有的童话故事一样，一切都发生在很久以前的城堡里。</p>
<p>Andersen tried hard to tell the plot and explain great themes with short and easy sentences and despite the fact that the stories were short their composition was perfect from the starting point all the way to the end.</p>
<p>安徒生努力用简短的句子来讲述故事情节和解释伟大的主题，尽管故事很短，但他们的作文从开始到结尾都是完美的。</p>
<h2 id="book-summary">Book Summary</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, there was an Emperor who was only interested in good clothes. He was so in love with it that he did not care much for anything else. One day a few conmen appeared and told him that they were excellent weavers and that they could make the most beautiful fabric in the world. It didn’t take long to get the Emperor’s attention. They told him they made fabrics of wonderful samples and colors with a specific feature. They were invisible to anyone who was stupid or incapable of doing his job.</p>
<p>从前，有一个皇帝，他只对漂亮的衣服感兴趣。他太爱它了，别的什么都不在乎。一天，几个骗子出现了，他们告诉他，他们是优秀的织工，他们能织出世界上最漂亮的布料。没过多久就引起了皇帝的注意。他们告诉他，他们用很棒的样品和具有特定特征的颜色制作了面料。对任何愚蠢或不能胜任工作的人来说，他们是看不见的。</p>
<p>The conmen ordered some of the finest materials and secretly they sold them to get the money. To fool the Emperor and his servants they started to weave but there was nothing. The Emperor sent him most loyal servants to check up on them. When they saw that they can’t see the alleged fabric they were scared that they’ll get fired for being stupid or incompetent to do their jobs. That is the reason why they lied that they saw magical fabrics.</p>
<p>骗子们订购了一些最好的材料，然后偷偷地把它们卖了，以此来赚钱。为了愚弄皇帝和他的仆人，他们开始织布，但是什么也没有织。皇帝派了最忠诚的仆人去检查他们。当他们看到自己看不到所谓的组织结构时，他们害怕自己会因为愚蠢或不称职而被解雇。这就是为什么他们撒谎说他们看到了神奇的布料。</p>
<p>In the end, the Emperor decided together with many helpers see the fabrics and see how the weavers work was going. Everyone who accompanied him was afraid to come off as a stupid person so they admired the fabric that wasn’t there and advised the Emperor to put that nothing on himself. The conmen showed him the cape, pants, and the coat but they were actually empty-handed.</p>
<p>最后，皇帝决定和许多帮手一起看看这些织物，看看织工们是如何工作的。每个跟他一起来的人都害怕给人留下愚蠢的印象，所以他们很欣赏那块布料，并建议皇帝什么也不要穿。骗子给他看了斗篷、裤子和外套，但实际上他们两手空空。</p>
<p>The Emperor took all the clothes off of himself and the conmen dressed him in the invisible clothes. The Emperor started a procession where his servants walked behind him with their hands raised to hold the cape. Everyone admired him and his new clothes until one boy yelled that the Emperor had no clothes on.</p>
<p>皇帝把身上所有的衣服都脱掉了，骗子们给他穿上了看不见的衣服。皇帝开始了一场游行，他的仆人们举着斗篷跟在他后面。每个人都很欣赏他和他的新衣服，直到一个男孩大喊皇帝没穿衣服。</p>
<p><strong>Characters</strong>: Emperor, Conmen, The Child, Servants</p>
<h2 id="characters-analysis">Characters Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Emperor</strong> was a leader that got comforted with his position and all of the sudden he was confronted with the fact that he could lose his position for stupidity and incompetence.</p>
<p>皇帝是一个对自己的职位感到满意的领导人，突然他面临着一个事实，他可能会因为愚蠢和无能而失去他的职位。</p>
<p><strong>Conmen</strong> were sly and managed to fool the whole castle and in the end, they accomplished their goal and got rich.</p>
<p>骗子们狡猾地骗过了整座城堡，最后，他们实现了他们的目标，变得富有。</p>
<p><strong>The child</strong> is the voice of consciousness in this story. In his naivety and a life deprived of ambition linked to material interests, he is the only one that spoke the truth. At the end, we have a question whether anyone needs honesty and truth in a world ruled by lies.</p>
<p>在这个故事中，孩子是意识的声音。在他的天真烂漫和被剥夺了与物质利益相关的野心的生活中，他是唯一说真话的人。最后，我们有一个问题，是否有人需要诚实和真相在一个由谎言统治的世界。</p>
<p><strong>A regiment</strong> is a large group of people that snaps out of lies when someone tells the truth. They accept the truth but it doesn’t matter because lies are well settled in their world.</p>
<p>一个团是一大群人，当有人说真话的时候，他们就会脱口而出。他们接受事实，但这并不重要，因为谎言在他们的世界里已经根深蒂固。</p>
<p><strong>Servants</strong> are the people loyal to the Emperor and they live in fear of losing their jobs if they seem stupid by saying they don’t see anything. Just to keep their position they are ready to accept any kind of lie and support it.</p>
<p>仆人是忠于皇帝的人，他们生活在失去工作的恐惧中，如果他们说他们什么也没看到，显得很愚蠢。为了保住自己的位置，他们愿意接受任何形式的谎言并予以支持。</p>
