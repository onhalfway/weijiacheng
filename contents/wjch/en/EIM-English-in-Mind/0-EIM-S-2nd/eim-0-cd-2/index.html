<li>What British teenagers watch</li>
<li>Claire Woods</li>
<li>Claire is 16. She lives in Godalming in the south of England. She doesn't watch TV every day. She's selective - she chooses which programmes to watch. This is what she says about TV.</li>
<li>
<p>'No, I don't watch TV every day. I think it can be a waste of time. My favourite programmes are competitions - like Britain's Got Talent. I always watch that. The people do great things. And that's why I like it a lot. I also watch documentaries - especially about life in other countries, because I really like geography. I sometimes watch cartoons at the weekend. I watch about eight hours of TV a week, I guess. I never watch sports programmes - I don't like them at all. And I hardly ever watch the news.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CD2T9: Listen to the interview with Paul again. Underline the correct words.</p>
</li>
<li>TAPESCRIPT</li>
<li>Claire: Excuse me. Can I ask you some questions, please?</li>
<li>Paul: Er... yes. What's it about?</li>
<li>Claire: About TV actually. But first, what's your name and how old are you?</li>
<li>Paul: My name's Paul Evans and I'm seventeen.</li>
<li>Claire: Where do you live, Paul?</li>
<li>Paul: I live in Sheffield in the north of England.</li>
<li>Claire: OK. Do you watch a lot of TV, Paul?</li>
<li>Paul: Yes, I do. Well, I watch something on TV every day.</li>
<li>Claire: What sort of programmes do you like?</li>
<li>Paul: Erm, I like some of the drama series. My favorites are CSI and Lost. But I also love sports programmes. I watch football on TV, so I watch a lot of television on Saturdays and Sundays.</li>
<li>Claire: Do you like comedies?</li>
<li>Paul: No, not much.</li>
<li>Claire: What about soap operas?</li>
<li>No, I hate them. I think that's really stupid.</li>
<li>Claire: How many hours of a week do you watch TV, Paul?</li>
<li>Paul: Erm, about ten, no, twelve hours of a week, I think. Mostly the weekends.</li>
<li>Claire: Thanks for talking to me, Paul.</li>
<li>
<p>Paul: No problem.</p>

<li>1 How does Rick talk to people?</li>
<li>2 What do people do in a triathlon?</li>
<li>3 How does Dick help Rick in a triathlon event?</li>
<li>4 What name do Rick and Dick have when they do a triathlon?</li>
<li>5 How long do they take to finish a triathlon?</li>
<li>
<p>6 Dick says:'We think that we always win'. Why does he say that, do you think?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'We never win, but we always win.'</p>
</li>
<li>Rick Hoyt is American. He is a wheelchair because he's got cerebral palsy. He can't talk so he uses a computer to communicate with people. Rick is a happy and successful man; he has a job at the University of Boston, and he works in computer studies. Rick loves sport too, and he takes part in marathons and triathlons.</li>
<li>Triathlons? In the triathlon, people swim four kilometres, cycle 180 kilometres and then run a marathon, 42 kilometres. Rick can't run, cycle or swim because he's in a wheelchair. So how can he take part in a triathlon? Rick can take part because he does it with his father, Dick Hoyt. In the running, his father pushed him in his wheelchair. In the swimming, Rick lies in a small boat and Dick swims and pulls him. And in the cycling. Rick sits in a special seat on the front of Dick's bike. Together, they are 'Team Hoyt'.</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, Team Hoyt never wins the race. The winner of a triathlon usually finishes in about nine hours. The Hoyts usually take about 14 or 15 hours. 'That's right,' says Dick. 'Rick and I never win. But we think that we always win.'</p>

<li><code>Scotland - a land of traditions</code></li>
<li>Scotland has lots of beautiful places to visit - and there are some special days there, too. Here are three of them.</li>
<li>1 Burns Night</li>
<li>Every year on 25 January, the Scots remember a famous poet called Robert Burns. Usually there is a special dinner, and people eat haggis (which is made from different bits of a sheep!). People play music and they read Burn's poems aloud.</li>
<li>2 Hogmanay</li>
<li>Hogmanay is an important holiday for the Scottish people. It is on 31 December - New year's Eve. Like everywhere in the world, Scottish people celebrate the New Year with a party. Then, early in the morning of 1 January, they put on warm coats and go 'first footing' - they visit the homes of their friends and take a piece of bread and a piece of coal, to bring their friends food and warmth all year.</li>
<li>3 Highland Games</li>
<li>
<p>In the summer, there are Highland Games days all over Scotland. The men wear kilts (a type of skirt) and socks made from a special material called 'tartan'. Women wear beautiful skirts, blouses and scarves. There is dancing and the bands play music. There are lots of athletic events too - a famous one is 'tossing the caber': men try to throw a six-metre tree trunk (the 'caber').</p>

<li>The 'Edinburgh International Festival' started in 1947. Artists and actors come from around the world, and there are many exhibitions and performances. People talk about 'The Edinburgh Festival', but there are really several festivals that all happen in August. There is a film festival, a theatre festival, a jazz festival, a book festival, and many others.</li>
<li>A famous event is the Edinburgh Tattoo - army bands from Scotland and other countries play music inside Edinburgh Castle at night. There is dancing too, especially Scottish country dancing. Every year, over 200,000 people watch the Tattoo and listen to the famous Scottish bagpipes.</li>
<li>
<p>People come from all over the world to see the events in Edinburgh. Hotels and guesthouses are always full, so if you want to see the festival, it's important to plan early. Do you want to go? Start planning now!</p>

<li><code>The Day the Music Died</code></li>
<li>On 3 February 1959, three men were in a small plane in Iowa, USA, at one o'clock in the morning. They were Buddy Holly, Ritchie valens and J.P.Richardson (or 'The Big Bopper').</li>
<li>The three men were singers and musicians. Buddy Holly was very successful, with his songs like Peggy Sue and That'll be the Day. Valens and the Big Bopper were stars too.</li>
<li>It was a very cold night and there was snow and a lot of wind. The plane wasn't in the air for very long when there was a problem. The plane went down and crashed. The three musicians, and the pilot, were all dead.</li>
<li>Buddy Holly was only 22, and Ritchie Valens was only 17. The Big Bopper was 28.</li>
<li>
<p>In 1971, another singer, Don McLean, wrote a song about that terrible day. It was called American Pie and was about 'the day the music died'.</p>

<li><code>SHE SAID 'NO'</code></li>
<li>One day in December nineteen-fifty-five (1955), Rosa Parks left work in Alabama, USA, got on a bus and sat down. More people got on the bus, and soon it was full. One man didn't have a seat. The bus driver said to Rosa:'Stand up! Give this man your seat!' Rosa was tired after a long day at work. So, she quietly said:'No.' This started something that changed the USA for ever - because Rosa Parks was a 42-year-old black woman, and the man on the bus was white.</li>
<li>When Rosa was a little girl, she walked to school, but the white children took a bus. Rosa saw their bus every day when it went past. 'In those days,' she said, 'there was a white world and a black world. I lived in the black world.' She went to a black school and studied with black children. When Rosa said 'No', she broke the law. The law said a black person had to give their seat to a white person. The police came and took her to prison. Many black people in Alabama were very angry, and they stopped using the buses for a year. Then the law changed, and slowly, things started to change all over the USA.</li>
<li>
<p>For the rest of her life, Rosa worked to help black people in the USA. She died on twenty-fifth (25) October two thousand and five (2005), at the age of ninety-two (92).</p>

<li>Host: Hello, and welcome back, and in the next round of our quiz we are looking at important dates, OK?</li>
<li>Woman: Yes, OK.</li>
<li>Host: And here is the first question. Singer Michael Jackson died on the 25th of June. In which year?</li>
<li>Woman: Er, I think it was in 2009.</li>
<li>Host: And 2009 is ... absolutely correct. Jackson died on June the 25th 2009. Well done, Sarah. That's 20 points for you. And here's our next question. When did the first man walk on the moon? Was it a. on July the 20th 1949? b. on July the 20th 1969? or c. on July the 20th 1979?</li>
<li>Woman: Oh, er, the man's name was Neil Armstrong. And I think it was 1979, so 'c'.</li>
<li>Host: Well, Sarah, you're right about Neil Armstrong - but he didn't walk on the moon in 1979, it was on July the 20th 1969. So no points for that, I'm afraid. Don't worry. Let's look at the next question. You can get 40 points this time. This question is about the Olympic Games in Beijing, China. They started on August the 8th and ended on August the 24th. In which year? a. 2004? b. 2006? c. 2008?</li>
<li>Woman: That's easy. It was in 2008.</li>
<li>Host: That's absolutely correct. 40 points for you. The Beijing Olympic Games started on August the 8th and they ended on August the 24th 2008. And now Sarah - 100 points on the all or nothing question. In Alabama, USA, in a famous incident, Rosa Parks did not give her seat to a white man. What year was that?</li>
<li>Woman: Er, oh, I'm not sure! Urn ... was it... 1958?</li>
<li>
<p>Host: Oh, I'm sorry, Sarah. It was in 1955, not 1958. Sorry about that, but you get a wonderful prize ...</p>

<p><code>The daughter of a lion</code></p>

<li><em>Perhaps I am not a lion - but I am the daughter of a lion, and I have lion's heart.</em></li>
<li>These are the words of Queen Elizabeth Ⅰ (the first), daughter of King Henry Ⅷ (the eighth), and queen of England from fifteen-fifty-eight (1558) to sixteen-oh-three (1603).</li>
<li>Elizabeth's father wanted a son very badly. He married six times, and he had a son. Edward, but Edward died in 1553. After that, Henry's other daughter, Mary, was queen for a few years, and then it was her sister's turn. Elizabeth Ⅰ, <strong>aged</strong> 25, became a great queen.</li>
<li>In 1558, England was in a bad state. People were hungry, and France and Spain wanted to control England. Elizabeth had a good education and was very good at languages. This helped her when she talked to the <strong>ambassadors</strong> from other countries.</li>
<li>
<p>She was a very clever woman. She made good decisions, and made England a great country. Her period as queen is called 'The Elizabeth Age'. It was a great time for <strong>adventure</strong> and for <strong>literature</strong> - Sir Francis Drake sailed around the world, and Shakespeare wrote many famous plays and became one of the great writers in history. Elizabeth never married. When she died in 1603, her cousin James Ⅵ of Scotland became king. The next Queen Elizabeth became queen in 1953 - 350 years later.</p>

<p>TAPESCRIPT</p>
</li>
<li>Grandmother: I think life was great when I was a teenager. Yes, we had a lot of fun. Is it better now? I'm not sure. But it's very different! I think perhaps life is more interesting now - you know, there are computers and DVDs, and things like that. When I was young, of course, a lot of TV was in black-and-white, and we only got programmes in the afternoon and evening! But I think that life is more difficult for today's teenagers - for example, my grandson Dave. His school work - he gets a lot of homework to do, and he's always got tests and exams - it wasn't like that for me. I was freer than him, I think. School life is more difficult now, certainly. But you know, the really big difference? I think people were friendlier in the 60s than they are now.</li>
<li>
<p>Dave: I think perhaps that some things are easier now - for example, with mobile phones and the internet, I can talk to my friends any time I want to. But I also know that some things now are difficult for my grandma. I'm sure that now, life is faster than in the 1960s, and I think that's hard for her. I mean, now she's older, so of course things are more difficult - like, going shopping in town, it's hard for her, the streets are very crowded, they're more crowded than before - and there are a lot more cars these days, the roads are much busier than in the 1960s. And I'm sure that things in the shops are more expensive. So perhaps life is worse for her now - but she's a very happy person!</p>
