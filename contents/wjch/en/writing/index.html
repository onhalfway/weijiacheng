<p>Dear Tony,</p>
<p>I'd like to talk about my camping. I enjoy going camping with my friends because it's always great fun. <strong>We usually plan ahead and remember to take everything we need, such as tents and blankets.</strong> During the camping, we feel relaxed to see natural scenery and play together to enjoy each other's company. We are happy and excited. I'm always looking forward to going camping with my friends.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Li Hua</p>

<h3 id="jeff-camping">Jeff: Camping</h3>
<p>On a sunny day of last summer holiday, I went camping with my parents.</p>
<p>At a meadow which is surrounded by green mountains, we put our tent. Beside our tent there is a small stream, looking clear and bright. After tent-putting, my mom and dad began to cook. I felt a little bit hungry, and the food tasted good. And then, I came to the river side, took out my toy gun and shotted water. It was very interesting, and I played until it was getting dark. I felt tired and went into our tent. The sleeping bag was comfortable, so I had a sweet sleeping.</p>
<p>Camping outside is wonderful, we can enjoy fresh air and watch stars over the sky. That's an unforgettable experience.</p>

<p>1.注意词性“保持健康”是keep/stay healthy；“我们的健康”是our health；分别是形容词和名词  2.坚持做某事keep doing sth.如坚持锻炼keep doing exercise 而不是keep do exercise 3. 回家可以用go home；go back home表达，而不是go to home；还有回学校可以用go back to school；有同学直接拿back当动词写了I will back to school soon,这样的句子是错的，back前面加上go  4.让某人做某事make/let sb do sth，注意后面的动词是原形，如make me wash my hands more frequently  5.注意“拥挤的”crowded；“相信”believe；“肥皂”soap的拼写  6.“需要帮助的人”可以用people in need来表达  7.有同学想表达感染病毒，infect这个词，表示“使感染/传染”可以说The virus infected us.不可以说We infected the virus.  8.情态动词must/should /can后+动词原形，绝大多数同学再第一个动词还知道用原形，但是后面加了and，就会乱加to或ing了，如有人写成We can wash our hands and to wear/wearing/wore/ masks. 这样是错误的，and后面也应该用动词原形啊！  9.对某人某事有信心have confidence in sb/sth  </p>
<h3 id="excellent-2019-new-coronavirus">Excellent: 2019 new Coronavirus</h3>
<p>Recently, our country is fighting against the coronavirus. As a middle school student, what we do? what can't we do?</p>
<p>We can do some exercises. We can preview new knowledge. We can obey expert's instructions. We can stay at home.</p>
<p>We can't go outside without mask. We can't go to crowded places. We can't believe rumors and spread them.</p>
<p>Disease and virus will kill us, but they won't kill our spirit. If we fight against the virus, we will win, because for the last 5000 years we fought against our enemy just like today, we could win those wars, so we will win the war with virus.</p>

<p>Recently, our country is fighting against the coronvirus. As a middle school student, although we can't go to school on time, we can't go to school on time, we can study on internet. At this special moment, we should continue to stay at home and can not go to public places, such as has station, airport, subway and so on. If we need to go out to buy something, we can wear masks and glasses to protect us. While staying at home, we can do more exercise and wash our hands more often. We can't stare at the computer too long, because it will hurt our eyesight.</p>
<p>I hope we can win this battle soon.</p>
<h2 id="self-nominations">Self-nominations</h2>
<p>1.内容上大家都能把点写齐全，但是罗列申请原因和自己的优势的时候要稍微注意一点逻辑，建议用连接词连接各个句子。 2.注意几个词组搭配：be good at sth/doing sth  ；be interested in sth；want to do sth; practise/practice doing sth这里注意practise只能当动词，practice可以既当动词也能当名词   3.注意几个单词的拼写：竞争competition；合作cooperation；相信believe； 4.期待做某事look forward to doing sth   5.加入某个社团用join，不用join in</p>

<h3 id="good">good</h3>
<p>Dear club president, I'm Lihua. It's my honor to introduce myself in front of you. First of all, I don't want to go to any sports clubs like Basketball Club and all sorts of terrible clubs which can make you sweaty and smelly. My advantage in this game-playing club is you don't need to worry about me for not playing enough. I assure you, that I will take part in every training and competitions as much as I could. Why do I want to join this club? The answer is simple: Why don't I join this club? Am I crazy to sacrifice my precious time on other boring dull clubs instead of this one? I can do lots of things for the club, I can help my "GAME" mates, I can torture the enemies and I can also mock anyone I could to make you satisfied instead of myself. Maybe you can train me and make me do better on the skills of playing games. I can't wait for your reply.</p>
<p>Yours,
Lihua</p></div>
