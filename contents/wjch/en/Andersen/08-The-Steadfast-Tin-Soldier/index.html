<p>There were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers; they were all brothers, for they had been born of an old tin <strong>spoon</strong>. They <strong>shouldered</strong> their <strong>arms</strong>, they faced <strong>straight ahead</strong>, and their <strong>uniforms</strong>--red and blue--were ever so lovely. The very first thing they heard in this world, when the <strong>lid</strong> was <strong>taken off</strong> the box in which they were lying, were the words: "Tin soldiers!" It was shouted by a little boy, and he <strong>clapped</strong> his hands. They had been given to him for his birthday, and now he was <strong>lining them up</strong> on the table. Each soldier looked exactly like the other. Only one was slightly different: he had but one leg, for he was the last one to be <strong>cast</strong> and there hadn't been enough tin. And yet he stood just <strong>as</strong> <strong>firmly</strong> on his one leg <strong>as</strong> the others did on their two, and he is the very one who <strong>turns out to be</strong> <strong>unique</strong>.</p>

<p>从前有二十五个锡兵，他们都是兄弟，因为他们是由同一把旧的锡汤匙铸出来的。他们肩上扛着枪，眼睛笔直看着前面，穿着漂亮的军服，一半是红的，一半是蓝的。他们在这个世界上听到的第一句话是“锡兵”，这是他们躺在一个盒子里，一个小男孩打开盒盖后高兴得拍着双手说出来的。他们被送给他作为生日礼物，他站在桌子旁边把他们一个一个站起来。这些兵全都一模一样，只除了一个，他只有一条腿；他被铸到最后一个，融化的锡不够用了，于是让他用一条腿稳稳站住，这就使他非常显眼。</p>
<p>On the table where they had been lined up there were many other playthings, but the one that stood out most was a lovely paper castle. Through the tiny windows you could look right into the halls. Outside were tiny trees standing around a little mirror that was supposed to look like a lake. Wax swans were swimming on it and being reflected there. It was all lovely, and yet the loveliest of all was a little maiden who was standing in the open door of the castle. She too had been cut out of paper, but she was wearing a skirt of the sheerest lawn and a narrow ribbon over her shoulder just like a drapery; in the very center of it was a shining spangle as big as her whole face. The little maiden was stretching out both her arms, for she was a dancer, and then she had raised one leg so high in the air that the tin soldier couldn't find it at all, and he thought she had but one leg, just like himself.</p>
<p>锡兵们站着的桌子上还摆满了别的玩具，但最引人注目的是一座纸做的美丽小宫殿。透过小窗子可以看到里面的那些房间。宫殿前面有一些小树围着一面镜子，它就代表一个清澈的湖。几只蜡做的天鹅在湖上游着，它们的影子倒映在湖水里。这一切非常好看，但是最好看的是一位小姐，她站在宫殿开着的门口；她也是纸做的，穿一身淡雅的布裙，肩上围着一条蓝色的细缎带，就像披着一条披中。在缎带上插着一朵用锡纸做的闪光的玫瑰花，有她整张脸那么大。这位小姐是个舞女，她张开双臂，一条腿举得那么高，这位锡兵根本看不见它，以为她也和他一样只有一条腿。</p>
<p>"That's the wife for me!" he thought. "But she's very highborn. She lives in a castle and I have only a box, and then it must do for five-and-twenty of us--that's no place for her.Still, I must see about making her acquaintance!" And then he stretched out at full length behind a snuffbox that stood on the table. From here he could look right at the little highborn lady, who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance.</p>
<p>“她正好给我做妻子，”他想，“但是她太高贵了，住在宫殿里，而我只有一个盒子可以往，而且我们二十五个挤在一起，就住不下她了。不过我还是必须试试看和她相识。”于是他在桌上一个鼻烟盒后面平躺下来，好偷看那位漂亮的小姐，她继续用一条腿站着而不失去平衡。</p>
<p>Later in the evening all the other tin soldiers went back in their box, and the  people of the house went to bed. Now the toys began to play--at "Visitors," waging war, and holding balls. The tin soldiers rattled in their box because they wanted to join in, but they couldn't get the lid off. The nutcracker turned somersaults, and the slate pencil did monkeyshines on the slate; there was such a racket that the canary bird woke up and joined in the talk--and in verse, at that! The only two who didn't budge an inch were the tin soldier and the little dancer. She held herself erect on the tip of her toe and with both arms outstretched; he was just as steadfast on his one leg and his eyes never left her for a moment.</p>
<p>等到天晚了，其他锡兵都放进了盒子，那一家子的人也上床去睡了。这时候玩偶们就开始互相玩他们自己的游戏：串门，打仗，开舞会。锡兵们在盒子里也吵闹起来，他们也想出去跟大家一起玩，但是打不开盒盖。那些核桃钳子玩跳背游戏，铅笔在桌子上蹦蹦跳跳，吵得那么厉害。金丝鸟给吵醒了开始说话，而且出口成诗。只有那个锡兵和那位舞女在原地一动不动。她竖着脚尖站着，双臂张开，用一条腿站着和那锡兵用一条腿站得同样稳。他的眼睛连一瞬间也没有离开过她。</p>
<p>Now the clock struck twelve, and crash! The lid of the snuffbox flew off, but there wasn't any snuff in there--no, but a little black troll, and that was quite a trick.</p>
<p>钟敲十二点，鼻烟盒的盖子砰地打开；但是跳上来的不是鼻烟，而是一个黑色的小妖精；因为这鼻烟盒是个叫人吓一跳的玩具。</p>
<p>"Tin soldier!" said the troll. "Will you keep your eyes to yourself!"</p>
<p>“锡兵，”小妖精说，“不要指望不属于你的东西。”</p>
<p>But the tin soldier pretended not to hear.</p>
<p>但是锡兵假装没有听见他的话。</p>
<p>"Well, wait until tomorrow!" said the troll.</p>
<p>“很好；那就等到明天吧。”小妖精说。</p>
<p>Now, when it was morning and the children got up, the tin soldier was placed over in the window; and whether it was caused by the troll or the draft, the window suddenly flew open and the tin soldier went headlong out from the third floor with a terrible speed. He turned his leg up in the air and landed on his cap, with his bayonet stuck between the paving stones.</p>
<p>第二天早晨孩子们进来，把这锡兵放在窗口。好，也不知是小妖精干的，还是风吹的，但是窗子一下子打开，锡兵倒栽葱从三楼落到了下面街上。跌得可厉害了；因为是头朝下跌的，他的军盔和刺刀插在铺石的缝间，那条独腿朝天。</p>
<p>The maid and the little boy went right down to look for him, but despite the fact that they nearly stepped on him, they couldn't see him. If the tin soldier had shouted "Here I am!" they would have found him, all right. But he didn't think it proper to shout when he was in uniform.</p>
<p>女仆和那小男孩马上下楼来找他；但是哪儿也看不到他，虽然有一次她们险些儿就踩在他身上；如果他叫一声“我在这里”就好了，但是他穿着军服，大自豪了，不好大叫救命。</p>
<p>Now it started to rain; the drops fell thick and fast. It turned into a regular downpour. When it was over, two street urchins came along.</p>
<p>紧接着就下起雨来，雨点越来越密，最后下起了倾盆大雨。雨后恰巧有两个男孩走过！</p>
<p>"Look!" said the first. "There's a tin soldier. He's going out sailing!"</p>
<p>其中一个说：“瞧，这儿有个锡兵。他该有条船坐着航行。”</p>
<p>And so they made a boat out of a newspaper and put the tin soldier in the middle of it, and now he sailed down the gutter. Both the boys ran alongside and clapped their hands. Heaven help us! What waves there were in that gutter and what a current! But, then, the rain had poured down. The paper boat bobbed up and down, and now and then it turned around, sending a shudder through the tin soldier. But he was just as steadfast, didn't bat an eyelash, looked straight ahead, and shouldered his gun.</p>
<p>于是他们用一张报纸折成一条船，把锡兵放进去，让他顺着水沟航行，两个男孩在旁边跟着他走，一路拍着手。天哪，水沟里浪头多么大啊！水流得多么急啊！因为刚才那场雨太大了。把船摇来晃去，有时候转得那么快，锡兵也摇晃了；然而他保持坚定；他的脸色不变；笔直望着前面，扛着他的枪。</p>
<p>All at once the boat drifted in under a long gutter plank; it was just as dark as if he were in his box.</p>
<p>船忽然在一座桥下冲过，这桥是阴沟的一部分，接下来四周黑得像锡兵的盒子里一样。</p>
<p>"I wonder where I'm going now," he thought. "Well, well, it's the fault of the troll. Alas, if only the little maiden were sitting here in the boat, then it could be twice as dark for all I'd care!"</p>
<p>我这会儿是在上哪儿去呢？”他想，“我断定这都是那黑妖精捣的鬼。啊，要是那小姐和我一起在船上就好了，黑不黑我就一点也不在乎。”</p>
<p>At the same moment a big water rat came along, who lived under the gutter plank.</p>
<p>忽然出现了一只很大的水老鼠，它住在这儿阴沟里。</p>
<p>"Do you have a passport?" asked the rat. "hand over your passport!"</p>
<p>“你有通行证吗？”老鼠问道，“马上把它给我。”</p>
<p>But the tin soldier remained silent and held the gun even tighter. The boat flew away with the rat right behind it. Whew! How it gnashed its teeth and shouted to sticks and straws:"Stop him! Stop him! He hasn't paid the toll! He hasn't shown his passport!"</p>
<p>但是锡兵保持沉默，把枪握得更紧。船继续飘走，老鼠跟在后面。它是怎样地咬牙切齿啊，它对木屑和干草大叫：“拦住他，拦住他；他还没有付过路钱，还没有出示通行证。”</p>
<p>But the current grew stronger and stronger; the tin soldier could already see daylight ahead where the gutter plank ended, but he could also hear a roaring sound that was enough to frighten a brave man. Just think, where the gutter plank ended, the gutter poured right out into a big canal! It was just as dangerous for him as it would be for us to sail down a great waterfall.</p>
<p>但是水流得越来越急。锡兵已经看得见拱道尽头处阳光照耀了。这时候他听见一阵隆隆声，可怕得足以使最勇敢的人吓倒。在管道的尽头处，阴沟猛地泻入一条大运河，对于他来说，这危险程度就像瀑布对于我们一样。</p>
<p>Now he was already so close to it that he couldn't stop. The boat shot out; the poor tin soldier held himself as stiffly as he could. No one was going to say that he had blinked his eyes. The boat whirled around three or four times and filled with water right up to the edge. It had to sink. The tin soldier stood in water up to his neck. The boat sank deeper and deeper; the paper grew soggier and soggier. Now the water went over the tin soldier's head. Then he thought of the lovely little dancer, whom he would never see again, and in the ears of the tin soldier rang the song:</p>
<p>Fare forth! Fare forth, warrior!
Thou shalt suffer death!</p>
<ul>
<li>fare forth 动身,起程</li>
<li>warrior /ˈwɔːriər/ n. 战士，勇士；鼓吹战争的人</li>
</ul>
<p>他离它已经大近，没有办法停住，船就这样冲了下去，可怜的锡兵只能尽量挺直身体，眼皮也不动一动，表示他一点也不害怕。船旋转了三四圈，接着水漫到了船边；没有任何办法挽救它使它不沉下去了。现在他站在那里，水到了他的脖子，而船越沉越深，纸一湿就变软，松开来，最后水淹没了锡兵的头顶。他想起了那位再也看不到的娇美舞女，耳边响起了一首歌中这样的话：再见了，武士！你从来勇敢无比，一直飘到你的坟墓里。</p>
<p>Now the paper was torn to pieces and the tin soldier plunged through--but at the same moment he was gobbled up by a big fish.</p>
<p>这时候纸船已经破烂了，锡兵沉到水里去，很快就被一条大鱼吞下了肚子。</p>
<p>My, how dark it was in there! It was even worse than under the gutter plank, and then too it was so cramped! But the tin soldier was steadfast and lay at full length, shouldering his gun.</p>
<p>噢，在鱼的肚子里是多么黑啊！比在水管里要黑得多，也窄得多，但是锡兵继续保持坚定，扛着枪平躺在那里。</p>
<p>The fish darted about; it made the most terrible movements. At last it was quite still. It was as if a flash of lightning had streaked through it. The light was shining quite brightly and someone shouted:"A tin soldier!"</p>
<p>鱼游来游去，作出最惊人的动作，但最后完全静止下来。过了一会儿，锡兵身上好像掠过一道闪电；接着阳光照下来了，一个声音叫起来：“我敢说这是一个锡兵。”</p>
<p>The fish had been caught, taken to market, and sold, and had ended up in the kitchen, where the maid had cut it open with a big knife. With two fingers she picked the tin soldier up by the middle and carried him into the parlor, where they all wanted to see this remarkable man who had journeyed about in the stomach of a fish. But the tin soldier wasn't proud at all. They stood him up on the table, and there--my, what strange things can happen in this world! The tin soldier was in the very same room he had been in before! He saw the very same children and the playthings standing on the table, and the lovely castle with the beautiful little dancer. She was still standing on one leg and holding the other high in the air--she was steadfast too. The tin soldier was so moved that he could have cried tears of tin, but it wasn't proper! He looked at her and she looked at him, but they didn't say anything.</p>
<p>原来那条鱼被捉住了，送到市场上卖给了一个女厨子，她把它拿进厨房，用一把大菜刀把它剖开，她把锡兵夹起来，用食指和大拇指就这样夹住他的腰送到房间里。大家都急着要看看这个在鱼肚子里旅行了一通的了不起的锡兵；但是他一点也不觉得自豪。他们把他放在桌子上，可是——世界上真会发生那么多意想不到的古怪事情——他竟就在原来那个房间里，他就是从这房间的窗口跌到外面去的；孩子们是原来的孩子们，桌子上是原来的玩具、原来那座美丽的宫殿，娇美的小舞女就站在它的门前；她仍旧用一条腿平衡着身体，另一条腿举起，因此她和他自己一样坚定。看到她，锡兵感动得几乎要流下锡的眼泪来，但是他忍住了。他只是看着她，两个都保持着沉默。</p>
<p>At the same moment one of the little boys took the tin soldier and threw him right into the tiled stove without giving any reason for doing so. It was decidedly the troll in the box who was to blame.</p>
<p>这时候一个小男孩把锡兵拿起来扔进了火炉。他毫无理由这样做，因此这一定是鼻烟盒里那个黑妖精捣的鬼。</p>
<p>The tin soldier stood all aglow and felt the terrible heat--but whether it was from the real fire or from love, he didn't know. His colors were all gone, but whether that had happened on the journey or from sorrow, no one could tell. He looked at the little maiden, she looked at him, and he felt he was melting. But still he stood steadfast and shouldered his gun. Then a door opened, the wind took the dancer, and like a sylphid she flew right into the tiled stove to the tin soldier, blazed up, and was gone. Then the tin soldier melted to a clump, and when the maid took out the ashes the next day, she found him in the shape of a little tin heart. Of the dancer, on the other hand, only the spangle was left, and that was burned as black as coal.</p>
<p>锡兵站在那里，火焰燎到他，热得厉害，但是他说不出这是由于真实的火还是由于爱情的火。接着他看到他军服上鲜艳的颜色退了，但这是在旅途中被洗得退去的呢，还是由于伤心而退去的呢，没有人能说出来。他看着那位小姐，那位小姐看着他。他感到自己在熔化了，但是他肩上扛着枪，保持着坚定。忽然房门打开，风把那小舞女吹起来，她像个空气仙子一样飘飘然，正好飞到火炉里锡兵的身边，马上着火，烧没了。锡兵熔化成一块锡。第二天早晨当女仆来出炉灰的时候，她发现他化成了一颗小小的锡的心。至于那位小舞女，那就什么也没有剩下，只留下了那朵用锡纸做的玫瑰花，烧黑了，像一块炭。</p></div>
