<p>There were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers; they were all brothers, for they had been born of an old tin <strong>spoon</strong>. They <strong>shouldered</strong> their <strong>arms</strong>, they faced straight ahead, and their uniforms--red and blue--were ever so lovely. The very first thing they heard in this world, when the lid was taken off the box in which they were lying, were the words: "Tin soldiers!" It was shouted by a little boy, and he clapped his hands. They had been given to him for his birthday, and now he was lining them up on the table. Each soldier looked exactly like the other. Only one was slightly different: he had but one leg, for he was the last one to be cast and there hadn't been enough tin. And yet he stood just as firmly on his one leg as the others did on their two, and he is the very one who turns out to be unique.</p>

<p>从前有二十五个锡兵，他们都是兄弟，因为他们是由同一把旧的锡汤匙铸出来的。他们肩上扛着枪，眼睛笔直看着前面，穿着漂亮的军服，一半是红的，一半是蓝的。</p>
<p>他们在这个世界上听到的第一句话是“锡兵”，这是他们躺在一个盒子里，一个小男孩打开盒盖后高兴得拍着双手说出来的。他们被送给他作为生日礼物，他站在桌子旁边把他们一个一个站起来。这些兵全都一模一样，只除了一个，他只有一条腿；他被铸到最后一个，融化的锡不够用了，于是让他用一条腿稳稳站住，这就使他非常显眼</p>
<p>On the table where they had been lined up there were many other playthings, but the one that stood out most was a lovely paper castle. Through the tiny windows you could look right into the halls. Outside were tiny trees standing around a little mirror that was supposed to look like a lake. Wax swans were swimming on it and being reflected there. It was all lovely, and yet the loveliest of all was a little maiden who was standing in the open door of the castle. She too had been cut out of paper, but she was wearing a skirt of the sheerest lawn and a narrow ribbon over her shoulder just like a drapery; in the very center of it was a shining spangle as big as her whole face. The little maiden was stretching out both her arms, for she was a dancer, and then she had raised one leg so high in the air that the tin soldier couldn't find it at all, and he thought she had but one leg, just like himself.</p>
<p>"That's the wife for me!" he thought. "But she's very highborn. She lives in a castle and I have only a box, and then it must do for five-and-twenty of us--that's no place for her.Still, I must see about making her acquaintance!" And then he stretched out at full length behind a snuffbox that stood on the table. From here he could look right at the little highborn lady, who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance.</p>
<p>Later in the evening all the other tin soldiers went back in their box, and the  people of the house went to bed. Now the toys began to play--at "Visitors," waging war, and holding balls. The tin soldiers rattled in their box because they wanted to join in, but they couldn't get the lid off. The nutcracker turned somersaults, and the slate pencil did monkeyshines on the slate; there was such a racket that the canary bird woke up and joined in the talk--and in verse, at that! The only two who didn't budge an inch were the tin soldier and the little dancer. She held herself erect on the tip of her toe and with both arms outstretched; he was just as steadfast on his one leg and his eyes never left her for a moment.</p>
<p>Now the clock struck twelve, and crash! The lid of the snuffbox flew off, but there wasn't any snuff in there--no, but a little black troll, and that was quite a trick.</p>
<p>"Tin soldier!" said the troll. "Will you keep your eyes to yourself!"</p>
<p>But the tin soldier pretended not to hear.</p>
<p>"Well, wait until tomorrow!" said the troll.</p>
<p>Now, when it was morning and the children got up, the tin soldier was placed over in the window; and whether it was caused by the troll or the draft, the window suddenly flew open and the tin soldier went headlong out from the third floor with a terrible speed. He turned his leg up in the air and landed on his cap, with his bayonet stuck between the paving stones.</p>
<p>The maid and the little boy went right down to look for him, but despite the fact that they nearly stepped on him, they couldn't see him. If the tin soldier had shouted "Here I am!" they would have found him, all right. But he didn't think it proper to shout when he was in uniform.</p>
<p>Now it started to rain; the drops fell thick and fast. It turned into a regular downpour. When it was over, two street urchins came along.</p>
<p>"Look!" said the first. "There's a tin soldier. He's going out sailing!"</p>
<p>And so they made a boat out of a newspaper and put the tin soldier in the middle of it, and now he sailed down the gutter. Both the boys ran alongside and clapped their hands. Heaven help us! What waves there were in that gutter and what a current! But, then, the rain had poured down. The paper boat bobbed up and down, and now and then it turned around, sending a shudder through the tin soldier. But he was just as steadfast, didn't bat an eyelash, looked straight ahead, and shouldered his gun.</p>
<p>All at once the boat drifted in under a long gutter plank; it was just as dark as if he were in his box.</p>
<p>"I wonder where I'm going now," he thought. "Well, well, it's the fault of the troll. Alas, if only the little maiden were sitting here in the boat, then it could be twice as dark for all I'd care!"</p>
<p>At the same moment a big water rat came along, who lived under the gutter plank.</p>
<p>"Do you have a passport?" asked the rat. "hand over your passport!"</p>
<p>But the tin soldier remained silent and held the gun even tighter. The boat flew away with the rat right behind it. Whew! How it gnashed its teeth and shouted to sticks and straws:"Stop him! Stop him! He hasn't paid the toll! He hasn't shown his passport!"</p>
<p>But the current grew stronger and stronger; the tin soldier could already see daylight ahead where the gutter plank ended, but he could also hear a roaring sound that was enough to frighten a brave man. Just think, where the gutter plank ended, the gutter poured right out into a big canal! It was just as dangerous for him as it would be for us to sail down a great waterfall.</p>
<p>Now he was already so close to it that he couldn't stop. The boat shot out; the poor tin soldier held himself as stiffly as he could. No one was going to say that he had blinked his eyes. The boat whirled around three or four times and filled with water right up to the edge. It had to sink. The tin soldier stood in water up to his neck. The boat sank deeper and deeper; the paper grew soggier and soggier. Now the water went over the tin soldier's head. Then he thought of the lovely little dancer, whom he would never see again, and in the ears of the tin soldier rang the song:</p>
<p>Fare forth! Fare forth, warrior!
Thou shalt suffer death!</p>
<p>Now the paper was torn to pieces and the tin soldier plunged through--but at the same moment he was gobbled up by a big fish.</p>
<p>My, how dark it was in there! It was even worse than under the gutter plank, and then too it was so cramped! But the tin soldier was steadfast and lay at full length, shouldering his gun.</p>
<p>The fish darted about; it made the most terrible movements. At last it was quite still. It was as if a flash of lightning had streaked through it. The light was shining quite brightly and someone shouted:"A tin soldier!"</p>
<p>The fish had been caught, taken to market, and sold, and had ended up in the kitchen, where the maid had cut it open with a big knife. With two fingers she picked the tin soldier up by the middle and carried him into the parlor, where they all wanted to see this remarkable man who had journeyed about in the stomach of a fish. But the tin soldier wasn't proud at all. They stood him up on the table, and there--my, what strange things can happen in this world! The tin soldier was in teh very same room he had been in before! He saw the very same children and teh playthings standing on the table, and the lovely castle with the beautiful little dancer. She was still standing on one leg and holding the other high in the air--she was steadfast too. The tin soldier was so moved that he could have cried tears of tin, but it wasn't proper! He looked at her and she looked at him, but they didn't say anything.</p>
<p>At the same moment one of the little boys took the tin soldier and threw him right into the tiled stove without giving any reason for doing so. It was decidedly the troll in the box who was to blame.</p>
<p>The tin soldier stood all aglow and felt the terrible heat--but whether it was from the real fire or from love, he didn't know. His colors were all gone, but whether that had happened on the journey or from sorrow, no one could tell. He looked at the little maiden, she looked at him, and he felt he was melting. But still he stood steadfast and shouldered his gun. Then a door opened, the wind took the dancer, and like a sylphid she flew right into the tiled stove to the tin soldier, blazed up, and was gone. Then the tin soldier melted to a clump, and when the maid took out the ashes the next day, she found him in the shape of a little tin heart. Of the dancer, on the other hand, only the spangle was left, and that was burned as black as coal.</p></div>
