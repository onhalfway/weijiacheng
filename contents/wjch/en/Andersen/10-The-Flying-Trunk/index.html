<h2 id="as-is">正文 as is</h2>
<p>There was once a merchant; he was so rich that he could pave the whole street, and most of a little alleyway too, with silver money. But he didn't do it; he knew of other ways to use his money. If he spent a shilling, he got back a daler. That's the sort of merchant he was--and then he died.</p>
<p>TODO: verify 从前有一个商人;他很有钱，可以用银元铺满整条街，甚至整条小巷的大部分。但他没有这样做;他知道还有其他方式来使用他的钱。如果他花了一先令，就会得到一大笔钱。他就是这样一个商人——后来他死了。</p>
<p>Now the son got all this money, and he lived merrily--going to masquerade balls every night, making paper kites out of rixdaler bills, and playing ducks and drakes on the lake with golden coins instead of stones. So I daresay the money could go, and go it did. At last he had no more than four shillings left, and he had no other clothes than a pair of slippers and an old bathrobe. His friends no longer bothered about him now, as, indeed, they couldn't walk down the street together. But one of them, who was kind, sent him an old trunk and said, "Pack it!" Now, that was all very well, but he had nothing to pack, and so he seated himself in the trunk.</p>
<p>现在，儿子得到了所有的钱，他过着快乐的生活——每天晚上去参加化装舞会，用纸币做纸风筝，用金币而不是石头在湖上玩鸭子和鸭子游戏。所以我敢说，钱可以去，去了它。最后，他只剩下四个先令了，除了一双拖鞋和一件旧浴衣外，他没有别的衣服。他的朋友们现在不再为他操心了，因为他们确实不能一起在街上走。但是其中一个好心的人，给了他一只旧箱子，说:“打包!”现在，一切都很好，但他没有什么东西可以收拾，所以他坐在箱子里。</p>
<p>It was a funny trunk. As soon as you pressed the lock, the trunk could fly--and fly it did! Whoops! It flew up through the chimney with him, high above the clouds, farther and farther away. The bottom creaked, and he was afraid it would go to pieces, for then he would have made quite a big jolt! Heaven help us! And then he came to the land of the Turks. He hid the trunk in the woods under the dried leaves and then went into the town. He  could do this easily, for among the Turks everyone, of course, walked around like he did, in a bathrobe and slippers. Then he met a nurse with a baby.</p>
<p>这是一个有趣的箱子。只要你一按下锁，箱子就会飞起来——它确实飞起来了!哎呀!它和他一起从烟囱里飞出来，飞得比云还高，越飞越远。船底嘎吱一声响了，他担心船会碎，因为那样的话，他就会颠得很厉害!天堂帮助我们!然后他来到了土耳其人的土地。他把树干藏在树林里的干树叶下面，然后就进城去了。他很容易做到这一点，因为在土耳其人当中，当然每个人都像他一样穿着浴衣和拖鞋四处走动。然后他遇到了一个带着婴儿的护士。</p>
<p>"listen, you Turkish nurse," he said, " what big castle is this close to the city? The windows are so high!"</p>
<p>“听着，你这个土耳其护士，”他说，“什么城堡离城这么近?窗户可真高啊!”</p>
<p>"The king's daughter lives there!" she said. "It has been prophesied that a sweetheart is going to make her very unhappy, so no one can come in to see her unless the king and the queen are there!"</p>
<p>“国王的女儿住在那儿!”她说。“据说有一个心上人要使她非常不幸，所以除非国王和王后在场，否则谁也不能进去看她!”</p>
<p>"Thanks!" said the merchant's son. And then he went out in the woods, seated himself in his trunk, flew up on the roof, and crawled in through the window to the princess.</p>
<p>“谢谢!”商人的儿子说。于是他走进树林，坐进箱子，飞上屋顶，从窗口爬了进去。</p>
<p>She was lying on the sofa asleep. She was so lovely that the merchant's son had to kiss her. She woke up and was quite terrified, but he said that he was the God of the Turks, who had come down to her through the air, and she liked that very much.</p>
<p>她躺在沙发上睡着了。她是那么可爱，商人的儿子不得不吻她。她醒了过来，吓了一大跳，但他说他是土耳其人的神，他们从空中来到她身边，她非常喜欢。</p>
<p>Then they sat next to each other, and he told her tales about her eyes: they were the loveliest dark pools, and her thoughts swarm about there like mermaids. And he told her about her forehead: it was a snow-capped mountain with the most magnificent halls and pictures. And he told her about the stork that brings the sweet little babies.</p>
<p>于是他们就挨在一起坐着。他给她讲关于她的眼睛的故事。他告诉她关于她的前额的事情:那是一座白雪皑皑的山，有最宏伟的宫殿和图画。他告诉她关于鹳鸟带来了可爱的小婴儿。</p>
<p>Yes, those were some lovely tales! Then he proposed to the princess, and she said yes right away.</p>
<p>是的，那些是一些可爱的故事!然后他向公主求婚，公主马上答应了。</p>
<p>"But you must come here on Saturday," she said. "Then teh king and the queen will be here with me for tea! They will be very proud that I am getting the God of the Turks. But see to it that you know a really lovely story, for my parents are especially fond of them. My mother likes it to be moral and decorous, while my father likes it jolly, so you can laugh!"</p>
<p>“可是你星期六一定要来呀，”她说。“那么国王和王后会来和我一起喝茶!”他们会为我得到土耳其人的神而感到非常自豪。不过你要知道一个真正可爱的故事，因为我的父母特别喜欢他们。我妈妈喜欢它有道德，有礼貌，而我爸爸喜欢它有趣味，这样你就可以笑了!”</p>
<p>"Well, I'm bringing no other wedding present than a story!" he said, and then they parted. But the princess gave him a saber that was encrusted with golden coins--and he could particularly use those.</p>
<p>“好吧，除了故事，我不带别的结婚礼物!”他说，然后他们分手了。但公主给了他一把镶有金币的军刀——他特别需要这些金币。</p>
<p>Now he flew away, bought himself a new bathrobe, and then sat out in the woods and started making up a story. It had to be ready by Saturday, and that's not at all easy.</p>
<p>现在他飞走了，给自己买了一件新的浴袍，然后坐在树林里，开始编造故事。必须在星期六之前准备好，这一点也不容易。</p>
<p>Then he was ready, and then it was Saturday.</p>
<p>然后他准备好了，然后就是星期六了。</p>
<p>The king and the queen and the whole court were waiting with tea at the princess'. He was given such a nice reception!</p>
<p>国王、王后和整个宫廷的人都在公主家等着用茶点。他受到了如此热情的接待!</p>
<p>"Now, will you tell a story!" said the queen. "Once that is profound and imparts a moral."</p>
<p>“现在，你讲个故事吧!”王后说。“一旦那是深刻的，是道德的。”</p>
<p>"But one that can still make you laugh!" said the king.</p>
<p>国王说:“不过我要做的是一件能让你发笑的事情。”</p>
<p>"Yes, of course!" he said, and started his tale. And now you must listen very carefully.</p>
<p>“是的，当然!”他说着，开始了他的故事。现在你必须仔细听。</p>
<p>"There was once a bunch of matches that were so exceedingly proud of their high descent. Their family tree--that is to say, the big fir tree of which each one was a tiny stick--had been a huge old tree in the forest. The matches were now lying on the shelf between a tinderbox and an old iron pot, and they were telling them about their youth.</p>
<p>“从前有一束火柴，它们对于自己的高贵血统感到非常骄傲。他们的族谱——也就是说，那棵每棵都是一根小树枝的大冷杉——曾经是森林里的一棵巨大的老树。火柴现在就躺在架子上，在一个火绒箱和一个旧铁罐中间。</p>
<p>'Yes, when we lived high on the green branch,' they said, 'we were really living high! Every morning and evening, diamond tea--that was teh dew. All day we had sunshine--when the sun was shining--and all the little birds had to tell us stories. We were very well aware that we were rich too, for the leafy trees were clad only in the summer, but our family could afford green clothes both summer and winter. But then came the woodcutters--that was the Great Revolution--and our family was split up. The head of the family was given a post as the mainmast on a splendid ship that could sail around the world0--if it wanted to. The other branches ended up in other places, and it is now our task to provide light for the rank and file. That's why people of rank like ourselves happen to be in the kitchen.'</p>
<p>“是的，当我们住在高高的绿树枝上的时候，”他们说，“我们真的住得很高!每天早晚，钻石茶——那是露水。我们整天都有阳光——当太阳照耀的时候——所有的小鸟都给我们讲故事。我们很清楚，我们也很富有，因为树叶只在夏天才有衣服穿，而我们家在夏天和冬天都买得起绿色的衣服。但后来出现了伐木工人——这就是伟大的革命——我们的家庭分裂了。一家之主被分配了一个职位，作为一艘华丽轮船的主桅。这艘船可以环游世界——如果它愿意的话。其他的分支在其他地方结束了，现在我们的任务是为普通员工提供光明。这就是为什么像我们这样地位高的人碰巧在厨房里的原因。”</p>
<p>'Well, it's been different with me!' said the iron pot, which was lying beside the matches. 'Ever since I came out into the world, I've been scoured and boiled many times! I attend to the substantial things, and as a matter of fact, I really come first in this house. My only joy--next to the table--is to lie nice and clean on the shelf and carry on a sensible chat with my companions. But--with the exception of the water pail, which occasionally goes down in the yard--we always live indoor. Our only news bringer is the market basket, but it talks so alarmingly about the government and the people. Yes, the other day and elderly pot was so upset by it all that it fell down and broke to bits! That's liberalism, I tell you!'</p>
<p>“唉，我的情况就不一样了!”躺在柴火旁边的那个铁罐子说。“自从我来到这个世界上，我已经被擦洗和煮过很多次了!”我关心的是实质性的事情，事实上，在这所房子里，我真的是第一位的。我唯一的乐趣——就在桌子旁边——就是舒舒服服地躺在架子上，与同伴们进行理智的交谈。但是——除了偶尔会从院子里掉下来的水桶——我们都住在室内。我们唯一能带来新闻的是“市场篮子”(market basket)，但它谈论的是政府和人们，令人担忧。是的，有一天，老壶被这一切弄得心烦意乱，摔得粉碎!我告诉你，那是自由主义!”</p>
<p>'Now you're talking too much!' said the tinderbox, and the steel struck the flint so the sparks flew. 'Weren't we going to have a cheerful evening?'</p>
<p>“现在你说得太多了!”火绒箱说着，钢片打在火石上，火星四溅。“我们今晚不是要过得很愉快吗?”</p>
<p>'Yes, let's talk about which of us is the most aristocratic!' said the matches.</p>
<p>“是的，让我们来谈谈我们谁是最高贵的!””火柴说。</p>
<p>'No, I don't enjoy talking about myself!' said the earthenware pot. 'Let's have an evening's divertissement. I'll begin. I'm going to tell about the sort of thing each one of us has experienced; you can enter into it so nicely, and that's such a delight. On the Baltic Sea, by the Danish beeches!...'</p>
<p>“不，我不喜欢谈论我自己!””瓦锅说。“咱们来玩一个晚上吧。我将开始。我将讲述我们每个人都经历过的事情;你可以很好地进入其中，这是多么令人高兴的事。在波罗的海边，在丹麦山毛榉林边……”</p>
<p>'That's a delightful beginning!' said all the plates. 'This is decidedly going to be the kind of story I like!'</p>
<p>“这是一个愉快的开始!”所有的盘子都说。“这肯定是我喜欢的故事!”</p>
<p>'Well, there I spent my youth with a quiet family. The furniture was polished, the floors washed; clean curtains were put up every fourteen days!'</p>
<p>“嗯，我在一个安静的家庭里度过了我的童年。家具擦得锃亮，地板洗得干干净净;每隔十四天就挂上一次干净的窗帘!”</p>
<p>'My, what an interesting storyteller you are!' said the mop. 'You can tell right away that it's being told by a lady. Such cleanliness pervades!'</p>
<p>“天哪，你真是个有趣的讲故事的人!”拖把说。“你一眼就能看出这是一位女士说的。这种清洁弥漫!”</p>
<p>'Yes, you can feel it!' said the water pail, and then it gave a little hop for joy, so it went splash on the floor.</p>
<p>“是的，你能感觉到!”水桶说着高兴地跳了一下，于是就扑通一声落在地板上了。</p>
<p>And the pot went on with the story, and the end was just as good as the beginning.</p>
<p>罐子继续讲故事，故事的结尾和开头一样好。</p>
<p>All the plates rattled with delight, and the mop took green parsley out of the sand bin and crowned the pot with it, for it knew this would irritate the others. 'And if I crown her today,' it said, 'then she'll crown me tomorrow!'</p>
<p>所有的盘子都高兴得嘎嘎作响，拖把把绿色的欧芹从沙箱里拿了出来，把它戴在锅盖上，因为它知道这样会惹恼别人。“如果我今天给她戴上王冠，”它说，“那么她明天就会给我戴上王冠!”</p>
<p>'Well, I want to dance,' said the fire tongs, and dance she did. Yes, heaven help us, how she could lift one leg up in the air! The old chair cover over in the corner split just from looking at it. 'May I be crowned too?' said the fire tongs, and then she was.</p>
<p>“好吧，我想跳舞，”火钳说，于是她就跳了起来。是的，老天保佑，她怎么能把一条腿举到空中!角落里的旧椅子一看就裂开了。“我也可以戴上王冠吗?”火钳说，于是她就睡着了。</p>
<p>'All the same, they're only rabble!' thought the matches.</p>
<p>“尽管如此，他们都是乌合之众!”火柴想。</p>
<p>Now the samovar was to sing, but it had a cold, it said--it couldn't unless it was boiling. But that was plain snobbishness; it wouldn't sing except when it was standing on the table in the room with the family.</p>
<p>现在茶炊要唱了，可是它说，它感冒了，除非它是煮着的，否则唱不出来。但那是明显的势利;它不会唱歌，除非它和家人一起站在房间的桌子上。</p>
<p>Over in the window sat an old quill pen, which the maid usually wrote with. There was nothing exceptional about it except that it had been dipped too far down in the inkwell. But because of this it now put on airs. 'If the samovar won't sing,' it said, 'then it needn't. Hanging outside in a cage is a nightingale. It can sing. To be sure, it hasn't been taught anything, but we won't malign it this evening!'</p>
<p>窗户上放着一支旧鹅毛笔，那是女仆常用来写字的。它没有什么特别之处，只是在墨水瓶里浸得太深了。但正因为如此，它现在才装腔作势。“如果茶炊不唱歌，”它说，“那就不唱了。外面笼子里挂着一只夜莺。它可以唱歌。可以肯定的是，没有人教过它，但是我们今天晚上不打算诽谤它!”</p>
<p>'I find it highly improper,' said the tea kettle, who was a kitchen singer and half sister to the samovar, 'that such an alien bird is to be heard! Is that patriotic? I'll let the market basket be the judge!'</p>
<p>“我觉得，”茶壶说，她是厨房里的歌手，也是茶炊的同父异母妹妹，“让人听到这样一只陌生的鸟，实在是太不应该了!这是爱国吗?我要让菜篮子来做裁判!”</p>
<p>'I'm simply vexed!' said the market basket. 'I'm as deeply vexed as anyone can imagine! Is this a fitting way to spend an evening? Wouldn't it be better to put the house to rights? Then everyone would find his place, and I'd run the whole caboodle! Then there'd be another song and dance!'</p>
<p>“我只是烦!”菜篮子说。“谁也想象不出我有多烦恼! 这样度过一个晚上合适吗?把房子整顿一下不是更好吗?然后每个人都找到自己的位置，我就可以管理所有的事情了!然后就会有另一场歌舞!”</p>
<p>'Yes, let's raise a rumpus!' they all said. At the same moment the door opened. It was the maid, and so they stood still. There wasn't a deep out of anyone. But there wasn't a pot there that didn't know what it was capable of doing or how distinguished it was.</p>
<p>“是的，让我们大吵大闹吧!”他们都说。正在这时，门开了。那是女仆，所以他们就站着不动。没有人的内心深处。但是那里没有一个罐子不知道自己能做什么，也不知道自己有多出众。</p>
<p>'Yes, if only I'd wanted to,' each thought, 'it really would have been a lively evening!'</p>
<p>“是的，如果我愿意的话，”每个人都想，“这将是一个热闹的夜晚!”</p>
<p>The maid took the matches and made a fire with them! Heavens, how they sputtered and burst into flames!</p>
<p>女仆拿起火柴，生起了火!天哪，他们是怎样喷出火焰的!</p>
<p>'Now,' they thought, 'everyone can see that we're the first! What a radiance we have! What a light!' and then they were burned out."</p>
<p>“现在，”他们想，“每个人都能看出我们是第一个!我们多么容光焕发啊!一盏灯!’然后他们就被烧光了。”</p>
<p>"That was a delightful story!" said the queen. "I felt just as if I were in the kitchen with the matches! Yes, now thou shalt have our daughter!"</p>
<p>“这真是一个有趣的故事!”王后说。“我觉得自己就像在厨房里拿着火柴一样!”是的，现在你可以拥有我们的女儿了!”</p>
<p>"Certainly!" said the king. "Thou shalt have our daughter on Monday!" They said "thou" to him now that he was going to be one of the family.</p>
<p>“当然可以!”国王说。“你星期一就可以得到我们的女儿了!”他们对他说“你”，因为他就要成为这个家庭的一员了。</p>
<p>And thus the wedding was decided; on the evening before, the entire city was illuminated. Buns and cakes were thrown out to be scrambled for. The street urchins stood on tiptoe, shouted "Hurrah!" and whistled through their fingers.</p>
<p>婚礼就这样决定了;前一天晚上，整个城市都被照亮了。人们把面包和蛋糕扔出去抢吃。街上的孩子们踮起脚尖，高声欢呼“万岁!”，并通过他们的手指吹着口哨。</p>
<p>It was truly magnificent.</p>
<p>真的很壮观。</p>
<p>"Well, I guess I'd better see about doing something too," thought the merchant's son, and then he bought rockets, torpedoes, and all the fireworks you can imagine, put them in his trunk, and flew up in the air with them.</p>
<p>“好吧，我想我最好也做点什么，”商人的儿子想，然后他买了火箭、鱼雷和所有你能想象得到的烟花，把它们放在他的箱子里，和它们一起飞到空中。</p>
<p>SWOOOOOOOOSH! How they went off! And how they popped!</p>
<ul>
<li>swosh 嗖嗖地动</li>
</ul>
<p>他们怎么走了!它们是如何爆开的!</p>
<p>It made all the Turks hop in the air so their slippers flew about their ears. They'd never seen a vision like this before. Now they could tell that it was the God of the Turks himself who was going to marry the princess.</p>
<p>它使所有的土耳其人在空中跳跃，所以他们的拖鞋在他们的耳朵周围飞舞。他们以前从未见过这样的景象。现在他们知道是土耳其人的神要娶公主为妻了。</p>
<p>As soon as the merchant's son had come back down in the forest again with his trunk, he thought, "I'll just go into the city to find out how it looked!" And of course it was only reasonable that he wanted to do that.</p>
<p>商人的儿子带着他的箱子又回到森林里来了。他想:“我要到城里去看看，看看箱子究竟是什么样子。”当然，他这样做是合理的。</p>
<p>My, how people were talking! Every last person he asked had seen it, in his own fashion, but they all thought it had been delightful!</p>
<p>天啊，人们都说些什么呀!他问的每一个人都以他自己的方式看过它，但是他们都认为它是令人愉快的!</p>
<p>"I saw the God of the Turks himself!" said one. "he had eyes like shining stars and a beard like frothy water!"</p>
<p>“我亲眼看见了土耳其人的神!”“他的眼睛像闪亮的星星，胡子像泡沫的水!”</p>
<p>"He flew in a fiery robe!" said another. "The loveliest cherubs were peeking out from among the folds!"</p>
<p>“他穿着一件火袍飞!”另一个说。“最可爱的小天使从羊圈里探出头来!”</p>
<p>Indeed, those were delightful things he heard, and on the following day he was to be married.</p>
<p>他听了这些话，真是高兴极了。第二天，他就要结婚了。</p>
<p>Now he went back to the forest to seat himself in the trunk--but where was it?</p>
<p>现在他回到森林里去，坐到箱子里去。可是箱子在什么地方呢?</p>
<p>The trunk had burned up! A spark from the fireworks had remained and set it on fire, and the trunk was in ashes. No longer could he fly, no longer could he come to his bride.</p>
<p>箱子烧掉了!烟火留下的火星把箱子点着了，箱子也成了灰烬。他再也不能飞了，再也不能到他的新娘那里去了。</p>
<p>She stood all day on the roof and waited. She's waiting still while he's wandering about the world telling stories. But they're no longer as gay as the one he told about the matches.</p>
<p>她整天站在屋顶上等着。当他在世界各地讲故事时，她还在等待。但他们已经不像他说的那场比赛那么快乐了。</p>
<p>她在屋顶上等待了一整天。她现在还在那儿等待着哩。而他呢，他在这个茫茫的世界里跑来跑去讲儿童故事;不过这些故事再也不像他所讲的那个“柴火的故事”一样有趣。</p>

<p>我觉得，”茶壶说——“他是厨房的歌手，同时也是茶壶的异母兄弟——我们要听这样一只外国鸟唱歌是非常不对的。这算是爱国吗?让上街的菜篮来评判一下吧?”</p>
<p>“我有点烦恼，”菜篮说。“谁也想象不到我内心里是多么烦恼!这能算得上是晚上的消遣吗?把我们这个家整顿整顿一下岂不是更好吗?请大家各归原位，让我来布置整个的游戏吧。这样，事情才会改变!”</p>
<p>“是的，我们来闹一下吧!”大家齐声说。</p>
<p>正在这时候，门开了。女佣人走进来了，大家都静静地站着不动，谁也不敢说半句话。不过在他们当中，没有哪一只壶不是满以为自己有一套办法，自己是多么高贵。“只要我愿意，”每一位都是这样想，“这一晚可以变得很愉快!”</p>
<p>女佣人拿起柴火，点起一把火。天啦!火烧得多么响!多么亮啊!</p>
<p>“现在每个人都可以看到，”他们想，“我们是头等人物。我们照得多么亮!我们的光是多么大啊!”——于是他们就都烧完了。</p>
<p>“这是一个出色的故事!”王后说。“我觉得自己好像就在厨房里，跟柴火在一道。是的，我们可以把女儿嫁给你了。”</p>
<p>“是的，当然!”国王说，“你在星期一就跟我们的女儿结婚吧。”</p>
<p>他们用“你”来称呼他，因为他现在是属于他们一家的了。(注：按照外国人的习惯，对于亲近的人用“你”而不是用“您”来称呼。)</p>
<p>举行婚礼的日子已经确定了。在结婚的头天晚上，全城都大放光明。饼干和点心都随便在街上散发给群众。小孩子用脚尖站着，高声喊“万岁!”同时用手指吹起口哨来。真是非常热闹。</p>
<p>“是的，我也应该让大家快乐一下才对!”商人的儿子想。因此他买了些焰火和炮竹，以及种种可以想象得到的鞭炮。他把这些东西装进箱子里，于是向空中飞去。</p>
<p>“啪!”放得多好!放得多响啊!</p>
<p>所有的土耳奇人一听见就跳起来，弄得他们的拖鞋都飞到耳朵旁边去了。他们从来没有看见过这样的火球。他们现在知道了，要跟公主结婚的人就是土耳奇的神。</p>
<p>商人的儿子坐着飞箱又落到森林里去，他马上想，“我现在要到城里去一趟，看看这究竟产生了什么效果。”他有这样一个愿望，当然也是很自然的。</p>
<p>嗨，老百姓讲的话才多哩!他所问到的每一个人都有自己的一套故事。不过大家都觉得那是很美的。</p>
<p>“我亲眼看到那位土耳奇的神，”一个说：“他的眼睛像一对发光的星星，他的胡须像起泡沫的水!”</p>
<p>“他穿着一件火外套飞行，”另外一个说：“许多最美丽的天使藏在他的衣褶里向外窥望。”</p>
<p>是的，他所听到的都是最美妙的传说。在第二天他就要结婚了。</p>
<p>他现在回到森林里来，想坐进他的箱子里去。不过箱子到哪儿去了呢?箱子被烧掉了。焰火的一颗火星落下来，点起了一把火。箱子已经化成灰烬了。他再也飞不起来了。也没有办法到他的新娘子那儿去。</p>
<p>她在屋顶上等待了一整天。她现在还在那儿等待着哩。而他呢，他在这个茫茫的世界里跑来跑去讲儿童故事;不过这些故事再也不像他所讲的那个“柴火的故事”一样有趣。</p>

<p>There once was a merchant so wealthy that he could have paved a whole street with silver, and still have had enough left over to pave a little alley. But he did nothing of the sort. He knew better ways of using his money than that. If he parted with pennies they came back to him as crowns. That's the sort of merchant he was-and then he died.</p>
<p>Now his son got all the money, and he led a merry life, went to masquerades every night, made paper dolls out of banknotes, and played ducks and drakes at the lake with gold pieces instead of pebbles. This makes the money go, and his inheritance was soon gone. At last he had only four pennies, and only a pair of slippers and a dressing gown to wear.</p>
<p>Now his former friends didn't care for him any more, as he could no longer appear in public with them, but one of them was so good as to send him an old trunk, with the hint that he pack and be off. This was all very well, but he had nothing to pack, so he sat himself in it.</p>
<p>It was no ordinary trunk. Press on the lock and it would fly. And that's just what it did. Whisk! It flew up the chimney, and over the clouds, and away through the skies. The bottom of it was so creaky that he feared he would fall through it, and what a fine somersault he would have made then! Good gracious! But at long last he came down safely, in the land of the Turks. He hid his trunk under some dry leaves in the woods, and set off toward the nearest town. He could do so very well, for the Turks all wear dressing gowns and slippers, just as he did.</p>
<p>When he passed a nurse with a child, he said, "Hello, Turkish nurse. Tell me, what's that great big palace at the edge of town? The one that has its windows up so high."</p>
<p>"That's where the Sultan's daughter lives," said the nurse. "It has been foretold that she will be unhappy when she falls in love, so no one is ever permitted to visit her except in the presence of her mother and father."</p>
<p>"Thank you," said the merchant's son. Back he went to the woods, sat in his trunk, and whisked off to the roof of the palace. From there, he climbed in at the Princess's window.</p>
<p>She lay fast asleep on a sofa, and she looked so lovely that the merchant's son couldn't help kissing her. She woke up and was terribly frightened, but he told her he was a Turkish prophet, who had sailed through the air just to see her. This pleased her very much.</p>
<p>As they sat there, side by side, he told her stories about her eyes. He said they were beautifully dark, deep lakes in which her thoughts went swimming by like mermaids. He told her about her forehead, which he compared to a snow-covered mountainside with its many wonderful halls and pictures. Then he told her about the stork, which brings lovely little children from over the sea. Oh, they were such pretty stories! Then he asked her to marry him, and the Princess said yes, right away.</p>
<p>"But you must come on Saturday," she told him, "when my mother and father will be here to have tea with me. They will be so proud when I tell them I am going to marry a prophet. But be sure you have a really pretty tale to tell them, for both my parents love stories. My mother likes them to be elevating and moral, but my father likes them merry, to make him laugh."</p>
<p>"I shall bring no other wedding present than a fairy tale," he told her, and so they parted. But first the Princess made him a present of a gold saber all covered with gold pieces, and this came in very handy.</p>
<p>He flew away, bought himself a new dressing gown, and went to the woods to invent a fairy tale. That wasn't so easy. However, he had it ready promptly on Saturday. The Sultan, his wife and the whole court awaited him at the Princess's tea party. They gave him a splendid reception.</p>
<p>"Won't you tell us a story?" said the Sultan's wife. "One that is instructive and thoughtful."</p>
<p>"One that will make us laugh, too," said the Sultan.</p>
<p>"To be sure," he said, and started his story. Now listen closely.</p>
<p>"There once was a bundle of matches, and they were particularly proud of their lofty ancestry. Their family tree-that is to say, the great pine tree of which they were little splinters-had been a great old tree in the forest. As the matches lay on the kitchen shelf, they talked of their younger days to the tinder box and an old iron pot beside them.</p>
<p>" 'When we were a part of the green branches,' they said, 'then we really were on a green branch! Every morning and evening we were served the diamond tea that is called dew drops. We had sunshine all day long, and the little birds had to tell us stories. It was plain to see that we were wealthy, for while the other trees' garments lasted only the summer, our family could afford to wear green clothes all the year round. But then the woodcutters came, there was a big revolution, and our family was broken up. The chief support of our family got a place as the mainmast of a fine ship, that could sail around the world if need be. The other branches were scattered in different directions, and now our task is to bring light to the lower classes. That's the reason we distinguished people came to this kitchen.'</p>
<p>" 'My lot has been quite different,' said the iron pot, who stood next to the matches. 'From the moment I came into this world, I've known little but cooking and scouring, day in, day out. I look after the solid and substantial part, and am in fact the most important thing in the house. My only amusement comes when dinner is over. Then, clean and tidy, I take my place here to have a sound conversation with my associates. But except for the watering pot, who now and then makes excursions into the yard, we always live indoors. Our only source of news is the market basket, and he speaks most alarmingly about the government and the people. Why, just the other day an old conservative pot was so upset that he fell down and burst. That basket is a liberal, I tell you!'</p>
<p>" 'You talk too much,' the tinder box flashed sparks from his flint. 'Let's have a pleasant evening.'</p>
<p>" 'Yes, let's talk about who among us is most aristocratic,' said the matches.</p>
<p>" 'No. I don't like to talk about myself,' said the earthenware crock. 'Let's have some entertainment this evening. I'll begin. I'll tell you the sort of things we already know. That won't tax our imaginations, and it is so amusing. By the Baltic sea, by the beech trees of Denmark-'</p>
<p>" 'That's a very pretty beginning,' the plates chattered. 'That's just the kind of story we like.'</p>
<p>" 'There I passed my youth in a quiet home, where they polished the furniture, and swept the floor, and hung up fresh curtains every fourteenth day!'</p>
<p>" 'How well you tell a story!' said the broom. 'You can hear right away that it's a woman who tells it. There's not a speck of dirt in it.'</p>
<p>" 'Yes, one feels that,' said the water pail, and made a happy little jump so the water splashed on the floor.</p>
<p>" 'The crock went on with her story, and the end was as good as the beginning.</p>
<p>"All the plates clattered for joy. The broom made a wreath of parsley to crown the crock, because she knew how that would annoy the others. And the broom thought, 'If I crown her tonight, she will crown me tomorrow.'</p>
<p>"'Now I'll do a dance,' said the fire tongs, and dance she did. Yes, good heavens, how she could kick one of her legs up in the air! The old chair cover in the corner split to see it. 'Will you crown me too?' said the tongs, so they gave her a wreath.</p>
<p>" 'What a common mob,' said the matches.</p>
<p>" 'The tea pot was asked to sing, but she had a cold in her throat. She said nothing short of boiling water could make her sing, but that was sheer affectation. She wished to sing only for the ladies and gentlemen in the drawing room.</p>
<p>"On the window sill was an old quill pen that the servant used. There was nothing remarkable about him except that he had been dipped too deep in the ink, but in that difference he took pride.</p>
<p>" 'The tea pot can sing or not, as she pleases,' he declared. 'In a cage, outside my window, there's a nightingale who will sing for us. He hasn't practiced for the occasion, but tonight we won't be too critical.'</p>
<p>" 'I find it highly improper,' said the tea kettle, who was the official kitchen singer, and a half-sister of the tea pot. 'Why should we listen to a foreign bird? Is that patriotic? Let the market basket make the decision.</p>
<p>" 'I am most annoyed,' said the market basket. 'I am more annoyed than anyone can imagine. Is this any way to spend an evening? Wouldn't it be better to call the house to order? Everyone take his appointed place, and I shall run the whole game. That will be something quite different.'</p>
<p>" 'Yes. Let us all make a noise,' they clamored.</p>
<p>"Just then the servant opened the door, and they stood stock-still. Not one had a word to say. But there was not a pot among them who did not know what he could do, and how well qualified he was. 'If I had wanted to,' each one thought, 'we could have a gay evening. No question about it!'</p>
<p>" 'The servant girl took the matches and struck a light with them. My stars, how they sputtered and flared!</p>
<p>" 'Now,' they thought, 'everyone can see we are the first. How brilliant we are! What a light we spread.' Then they burned out."</p>
<p>"That was a delightful story," said the Sultan's wife. "I felt myself right in the kitchen with the matches. My dear prophet, thou shalt certainly marry our daughter."</p>
<p>"Yes indeed," said the Sultan. "Thou shalt marry her on Monday." They said "Thou" to him now, for he was soon to be one of the family.</p>
<p>So the wedding day was set, and on the evening that preceded it the whole city was gay with lights. Cookies and cakes were thrown among the people. The boys in the street stood on tiptoe. They shouted, "Hurrah!" and whistled through their fingers. It was all so grand.</p>
<p>"I suppose I really ought to do something too," said the merchant's son. So he bought firecrackers, and rockets, and fireworks of every sort, loaded his trunk with them, and flew over the town.</p>
<p>Pop! went the crackers, and swoosh! went the rockets. The Turks jumped so high that their slippers flopped over their ears. Such shooting stars they never had seen. Now they could understand that it was the prophet of the Turks himself who was to marry their Princess.</p>
<p>As soon as the merchant's son came down in the woods, he thought, "I'll go straight to the town to hear what sort of impression I made." It was the natural thing to do.</p>
<p>Oh, what stories they told! Every last man he asked had his own version, but all agreed it had been fine. Very fine!</p>
<p>"I saw the prophet himself," said one. "His eyes shone like stars, and his beard foamed like water."</p>
<p>"He was wrapped in a fiery cloak," said another. "The heads of beautiful angels peeped out of the folds of it."</p>
<p>Yes, he heard wonderful things, and his wedding was to be on the following day. He went back to the woods to rest in his trunk-but what had become of it? The trunk was burned! A spark from the fireworks had set it on fire, and now the trunk was burned to ashes. He couldn't fly any more. He had no way to reach his bride. She waited for him on the roof, all day long. Most likely she is waiting there still. But he wanders through the world, telling tales which are not half so merry as that one he told about the matches.</p></div>
