<h1 id="the-flying-trunk">The Flying Trunk</h1>
<h2 id="as-is">正文 as is</h2>
<p>There was once a merchant; he was so rich that he could pave the whole street, and most of a little alleyway too, with silver money. But he didn't do it; he knew of other ways to use his money. If he spent a shilling, he got back a daler. That's the sort of merchant he was--and then he died.</p>
<p>Now the son got all this money, and he lived merrily--going to masquerade balls every night, making paper kites out of rixdaler bills, and playing ducks and drakes on the lake with golden coins instead of stones. So I daresay the money could go, and go it did. At last he had no more than four shillings left, and he had no other clothes than a pair of slippers and an old bathrobe. His friends no longer bothered about him now, as, indeed, they couldn't walk down the street together. But one of them, who was kind, sent him an old trunk and said, "Pack it!" Now, that was all very well, but he had nothing to pack, and so he seated himself in the trunk.</p>
<p>It was a funny trunk. As soon as you pressed the lock, the trunk could fly--and fly it did! Whoops! It flew up through the chimney with him, high above the clouds, farther and farther away. The bottom creaked, and he was afraid it would go to pieces, for then he would have made quite a big jolt! Heaven help us! And then he came to the land of the Turks. He hid the trunk in the woods under the dried leaves and then went into the town. He  could do this easily, for among the Turks everyone, of course, walked around like he did, in a bathrobe and slippers. Then he met a nurse with a baby.</p>
<p>"listen, you Turkish nurse," he said, " what big castle is this close to the city? The windows are so high!"</p>
<p>"The king's daughter lives there!" she said. "It has been prophesied that a sweetheart is going to make her very unhappy, so no one can come in to see her unless the king and the queen are there!"</p>
<p>"Thanks!" said the merchant's son. And then he went out in the woods, seated himself in his trunk, flew up on the roof, and crawled in through the window to the princess.</p>
<p>She was lying on the sofa asleep. She was so lovely that the merchant's son had to kiss her. She woke up and was quite terrified, but he said that he was the God of the Turks, who had come down to her through the air, and she liked that very much.</p>
<p>Then they sat next to each other, and he told her tales about her eyes: they were the loveliest dark pools, and her thoughts swarm about there like mermaids. And he told her about her forehead: it was a snow-capped mountain with the most magnificent halls and pictures. And he told her about the stork that brings the sweet little babies.</p>
<p>Yes, those were some lovely tales! Then he proposed to the princess, and she said yes right away.</p>
<p>"But you must come here on Saturday," she said. "Then teh king and the queen will be here with me for tea! They will be very proud that I am getting the God of the Turks. But see to it that you know a really lovely story, for my parents are especially fond of them. My mother likes it to be moral and decorous, while my father likes it jolly, so you can laugh!"</p>
<p>"Well, I'm bringing no other wedding present than a story!" he said, and then they parted. But the princess gave him a saber that was encrusted with golden coins--and he could particularly use those.</p>
<p>Now he flew away, bought himself a new bathrobe, and then sat out in the woods and started making up a story. It had to be ready by Saturday, and that's not at all easy.</p>
<p>Then he was ready, and then it was Saturday.</p>
<p>The king and the queen and the whole court were waiting with tea at the princess'. He was given such a nice reception!</p>
<p>"Now, will you tell a story!" said the queen. "Once that is profound and imparts a moral."</p>
<p>"But one that can still make you laugh!" said the king.</p>
<p>"Yes, of course!" he said, and started his tale. And now you must listen very carefully.</p>
<p>"There was once a bunch of matches that were so exceedingly proud of their high descent. Their family tree--that is to say, the big fir tree of which each one was a tiny stick--had been a huge old tree in the forest. The matches were now lying on the shelf between a tinderbox and an old iron pot, and they were telling them about their youth.</p>
<p>"'Yes, when we lived high on the green branch,' they said, 'we were really living high! Every morning and evening, diamond tea--that was teh dew. All day we had sunshine--when the sun was shining--and all the little birds had to tell us stories. We were very well aware that we were rich too, for the leafy trees were clad only in the summer, but our family could afford green clothes both summer and winter. But then came the woodcutters--that was the Great Revolution--and our family was split up. The head of the family was given a post as the mainmast on a splendid ship that could sail around the world0--if it wanted to. The other branches ended up in other places, and it is now our task to provide light for the rank and file. That's why people of rank like ourselves happen to be in the kitchen.'</p>
<p>"'Well, it's been different with me!' said the iron pot, which was lying beside the matches. 'Ever since I came out into the world, I've been scoured and boiled many times! I attend to the substantial things, and as a matter of fact, I really come first in this house. My only joy--next to the table--is to lie nice and clean on the shelf and carry on a sensible chat with my companions. But--with the exception of the water pail, which occasionally goes down in the yard--we always live indoor. Our only news bringer is the market basket, but it talks so alarmingly about the government and the people. Yes, the other day and elderly pot was so upset by it all that it fell down and broke to bits! That's liberalism, I tell you!'</p>
<p>"'Now you're talking too much!' said the tinderbox, and the steel struck the flint so the sparks flew. 'Weren't we going to have a cheerful evening?'</p>
<p>"'Yes, let's talk about which of us is the most aristocratic!' said the matches.</p>
<p>"'No, I don't enjoy talking about myself!' said the earthenware pot. 'Let's have an evening's divertissement. I'll begin. I'm going to tell about the sort of thing each one of us has experienced; you can enter into it so nicely, and that's such a delight. On the Baltic Sea, by the Danish beeches!...'</p>
<p>"'That's a delightful beginning!' said all the plates. 'This is decidedly going to be the kind of story I like!'</p>
<p>"'Well, there I spent my youth with a quiet family. The furniture was polished, the floors washed; clean curtains were put up every fourteen days!'</p>
<p>"'My, what an interesting storyteller you are!' said the mop. 'You can tell right away that it's being told by a lady. Such cleanliness pervades!'</p>
<p>"'Yes, you can feel it!' said the water pail, and then it gave a little hop for joy, so it went splash on the floor.</p>
<p>"And the pot went on with the story, and the end was just as good as the beginning.</p>
<p>"All the plates rattled with delight, and the mop took green parsley out of the sand bin and crowned the pot with it, for it knew this would irritate the others. 'And if I crown her today,' it said, 'then she'll crown me tomorrow!'</p>
<p>"'Well, I want to dance,' said the fire tongs, and dance she did. Yes, heaven help us, how she could lift one leg up in the air! The old chair cover over in the corner split just from looking at it. 'May I be crowned too?' said the fire tongs, and then she was.</p>
<p>"'All the same, they're only rabble!' thought the matches.</p>
<p>"Now the samovar was to sing, but it had a cold, it said--it couldn't unless it was boiling. But that was plain snobbishness; it wouldn't sing except when it was standing on the table in the room with the family.</p>
<p>"Over in the window sat an old quill pen, which the maid usually wrote with. There was nothing exceptional about it except that it had been dipped too far down in the inkwell. But because of this it now put on airs. 'If the samovar won't sing,' it said, 'then it needn't. Hanging outside in a cage is a nightingale. It can sing. To be sure, it hasn't been taught anything, but we won't malign it this evening!'</p>
<p>"'I find it highly improper,' said the tea kettle, who was a kitchen singer and half sister to the samovar, 'that such an alien bird is to be heard! Is that patriotic? I'll let the market basket be the judge!'</p>
<p>"'I'm simply vexed!' said the market basket. 'I'm as deeply vexed as anyone can imagine! Is this a fitting way to spend an evening? Wouldn't it be better to put the house to rights? Then everyone would find his place, and I'd run the whole caboodle! Then there'd be another song and dance!'</p>
<p>"'Yes, let's raise a rumpus!' they all said. At the same moment the door opened. It was the maid, and so they stood still. There wasn't a deep out of anyone. But there wasn't a pot there that didn't know what it was capable of doing or how distinguished it was.</p>
<p>"'Yes, if only I'd wanted to,' each thought, 'it really would hav ebeen a lively evening!'</p>
<p>"The maid took the matches and made a fire with them! Heavens, how they sputtered and burst into flames!</p>
<p>"'Now,' they thought, 'everyone can see that we're the first! What a radiance we have! What a light!' and then they were burned out."</p>
<p>"That was a delightful story!" said the queen. "I felt just as if I were in the kitchen with the matches! Yes, now thou shalt have our daughter!"</p>
<p>"Certainly!" said the king. "Thou shalt have our daughter on Monday!" They said "thou" to him now that he was going to be one of the family.</p>
<p>And thus the wedding was decided; on the evening before, the entire city was illuminated. Buns and cakes were thrown out to be scrambled for. The street urchins stood on tiptoe, shouted "Hurrah!" and whistled through their fingers.</p>
<p>It was truly magnificent.</p>
<p>"Well, I guess I'd better see about doing something too," thought the merchant's son, and then he bought rockets, torpedoes, and all the fireworks you can imagine, put them in his trunk, and flew up in the air with them.</p>
<p>SWOOOOOOOOSH! How they went off! And how they popped!</p>
<p>It made all the Turks hop in the air so their slippers flew about their ears. They'd never seen a vision like this before. Now they could tell that it was the God of the Turks himself who was going to marry the princess.</p>
<p>As soon as the merchant's son had come back down in the forest again with his trunk, he thought, "I'll just go into the city to find out how it looked!" And of course it was only reasonable that he wanted to do that.</p>
<p>My, how people were talking! Every last person he asked had seen it, in his own fashion, but they all thought it had been delightful!</p>
<p>"I saw the God of the Turks himself!" said one. "he had eyes like shining stars and a beard like frothy water!"</p>
<p>"He flew in a fiery robe!" said another. "The loveliest cherubs were peeking out from among the folds!"</p>
<p>Indeed, those were delightful things he heard, and on the following day he was to be married.</p>
<p>Now he went back to the forest to seat himself in the trunk--but where was it?</p>
<p>The trunk had burned up! A spark from the fireworks had remained and set it on fire, and the trunk was in ashes. No longer could he fly, no longer could he come to his bride.</p>
<p>She stood all day on the roof and waited. She's waiting still while he's wandering about the world telling stories. But they're no longer as gay as the one he told about the matches.</p>
<h2 id="a-translation-by-jean-hersholt"><a href="https://andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/hersholt/TheFlyingTrunk_e.html">a translation by jean hersholt</a>*</h2>
<p>There once was a merchant so wealthy that he could have paved a whole street with silver, and still have had enough left over to pave a little alley. But he did nothing of the sort. He knew better ways of using his money than that. If he parted with pennies they came back to him as crowns. That's the sort of merchant he was-and then he died.</p>
<p>Now his son got all the money, and he led a merry life, went to masquerades every night, made paper dolls out of banknotes, and played ducks and drakes at the lake with gold pieces instead of pebbles. This makes the money go, and his inheritance was soon gone. At last he had only four pennies, and only a pair of slippers and a dressing gown to wear.</p>
<p>Now his former friends didn't care for him any more, as he could no longer appear in public with them, but one of them was so good as to send him an old trunk, with the hint that he pack and be off. This was all very well, but he had nothing to pack, so he sat himself in it.</p>
<p>It was no ordinary trunk. Press on the lock and it would fly. And that's just what it did. Whisk! It flew up the chimney, and over the clouds, and away through the skies. The bottom of it was so creaky that he feared he would fall through it, and what a fine somersault he would have made then! Good gracious! But at long last he came down safely, in the land of the Turks. He hid his trunk under some dry leaves in the woods, and set off toward the nearest town. He could do so very well, for the Turks all wear dressing gowns and slippers, just as he did.</p>
<p>When he passed a nurse with a child, he said, "Hello, Turkish nurse. Tell me, what's that great big palace at the edge of town? The one that has its windows up so high."</p>
<p>"That's where the Sultan's daughter lives," said the nurse. "It has been foretold that she will be unhappy when she falls in love, so no one is ever permitted to visit her except in the presence of her mother and father."</p>
<p>"Thank you," said the merchant's son. Back he went to the woods, sat in his trunk, and whisked off to the roof of the palace. From there, he climbed in at the Princess's window.</p>
<p>She lay fast asleep on a sofa, and she looked so lovely that the merchant's son couldn't help kissing her. She woke up and was terribly frightened, but he told her he was a Turkish prophet, who had sailed through the air just to see her. This pleased her very much.</p>
<p>As they sat there, side by side, he told her stories about her eyes. He said they were beautifully dark, deep lakes in which her thoughts went swimming by like mermaids. He told her about her forehead, which he compared to a snow-covered mountainside with its many wonderful halls and pictures. Then he told her about the stork, which brings lovely little children from over the sea. Oh, they were such pretty stories! Then he asked her to marry him, and the Princess said yes, right away.</p>
<p>"But you must come on Saturday," she told him, "when my mother and father will be here to have tea with me. They will be so proud when I tell them I am going to marry a prophet. But be sure you have a really pretty tale to tell them, for both my parents love stories. My mother likes them to be elevating and moral, but my father likes them merry, to make him laugh."</p>
<p>"I shall bring no other wedding present than a fairy tale," he told her, and so they parted. But first the Princess made him a present of a gold saber all covered with gold pieces, and this came in very handy.</p>
<p>He flew away, bought himself a new dressing gown, and went to the woods to invent a fairy tale. That wasn't so easy. However, he had it ready promptly on Saturday. The Sultan, his wife and the whole court awaited him at the Princess's tea party. They gave him a splendid reception.</p>
<p>"Won't you tell us a story?" said the Sultan's wife. "One that is instructive and thoughtful."</p>
<p>"One that will make us laugh, too," said the Sultan.</p>
<p>"To be sure," he said, and started his story. Now listen closely.</p>
<p>"There once was a bundle of matches, and they were particularly proud of their lofty ancestry. Their family tree-that is to say, the great pine tree of which they were little splinters-had been a great old tree in the forest. As the matches lay on the kitchen shelf, they talked of their younger days to the tinder box and an old iron pot beside them.</p>
<p>" 'When we were a part of the green branches,' they said, 'then we really were on a green branch! Every morning and evening we were served the diamond tea that is called dew drops. We had sunshine all day long, and the little birds had to tell us stories. It was plain to see that we were wealthy, for while the other trees' garments lasted only the summer, our family could afford to wear green clothes all the year round. But then the woodcutters came, there was a big revolution, and our family was broken up. The chief support of our family got a place as the mainmast of a fine ship, that could sail around the world if need be. The other branches were scattered in different directions, and now our task is to bring light to the lower classes. That's the reason we distinguished people came to this kitchen.'</p>
<p>" 'My lot has been quite different,' said the iron pot, who stood next to the matches. 'From the moment I came into this world, I've known little but cooking and scouring, day in, day out. I look after the solid and substantial part, and am in fact the most important thing in the house. My only amusement comes when dinner is over. Then, clean and tidy, I take my place here to have a sound conversation with my associates. But except for the watering pot, who now and then makes excursions into the yard, we always live indoors. Our only source of news is the market basket, and he speaks most alarmingly about the government and the people. Why, just the other day an old conservative pot was so upset that he fell down and burst. That basket is a liberal, I tell you!'</p>
<p>" 'You talk too much,' the tinder box flashed sparks from his flint. 'Let's have a pleasant evening.'</p>
<p>" 'Yes, let's talk about who among us is most aristocratic,' said the matches.</p>
<p>" 'No. I don't like to talk about myself,' said the earthenware crock. 'Let's have some entertainment this evening. I'll begin. I'll tell you the sort of things we already know. That won't tax our imaginations, and it is so amusing. By the Baltic sea, by the beech trees of Denmark-'</p>
<p>" 'That's a very pretty beginning,' the plates chattered. 'That's just the kind of story we like.'</p>
<p>" 'There I passed my youth in a quiet home, where they polished the furniture, and swept the floor, and hung up fresh curtains every fourteenth day!'</p>
<p>" 'How well you tell a story!' said the broom. 'You can hear right away that it's a woman who tells it. There's not a speck of dirt in it.'</p>
<p>" 'Yes, one feels that,' said the water pail, and made a happy little jump so the water splashed on the floor.</p>
<p>" 'The crock went on with her story, and the end was as good as the beginning.</p>
<p>"All the plates clattered for joy. The broom made a wreath of parsley to crown the crock, because she knew how that would annoy the others. And the broom thought, 'If I crown her tonight, she will crown me tomorrow.'</p>
<p>"'Now I'll do a dance,' said the fire tongs, and dance she did. Yes, good heavens, how she could kick one of her legs up in the air! The old chair cover in the corner split to see it. 'Will you crown me too?' said the tongs, so they gave her a wreath.</p>
<p>" 'What a common mob,' said the matches.</p>
<p>" 'The tea pot was asked to sing, but she had a cold in her throat. She said nothing short of boiling water could make her sing, but that was sheer affectation. She wished to sing only for the ladies and gentlemen in the drawing room.</p>
<p>"On the window sill was an old quill pen that the servant used. There was nothing remarkable about him except that he had been dipped too deep in the ink, but in that difference he took pride.</p>
<p>" 'The tea pot can sing or not, as she pleases,' he declared. 'In a cage, outside my window, there's a nightingale who will sing for us. He hasn't practiced for the occasion, but tonight we won't be too critical.'</p>
<p>" 'I find it highly improper,' said the tea kettle, who was the official kitchen singer, and a half-sister of the tea pot. 'Why should we listen to a foreign bird? Is that patriotic? Let the market basket make the decision.</p>
<p>" 'I am most annoyed,' said the market basket. 'I am more annoyed than anyone can imagine. Is this any way to spend an evening? Wouldn't it be better to call the house to order? Everyone take his appointed place, and I shall run the whole game. That will be something quite different.'</p>
<p>" 'Yes. Let us all make a noise,' they clamored.</p>
<p>"Just then the servant opened the door, and they stood stock-still. Not one had a word to say. But there was not a pot among them who did not know what he could do, and how well qualified he was. 'If I had wanted to,' each one thought, 'we could have a gay evening. No question about it!'</p>
<p>" 'The servant girl took the matches and struck a light with them. My stars, how they sputtered and flared!</p>
<p>" 'Now,' they thought, 'everyone can see we are the first. How brilliant we are! What a light we spread.' Then they burned out."</p>
<p>"That was a delightful story," said the Sultan's wife. "I felt myself right in the kitchen with the matches. My dear prophet, thou shalt certainly marry our daughter."</p>
<p>"Yes indeed," said the Sultan. "Thou shalt marry her on Monday." They said "Thou" to him now, for he was soon to be one of the family.</p>
<p>So the wedding day was set, and on the evening that preceded it the whole city was gay with lights. Cookies and cakes were thrown among the people. The boys in the street stood on tiptoe. They shouted, "Hurrah!" and whistled through their fingers. It was all so grand.</p>
<p>"I suppose I really ought to do something too," said the merchant's son. So he bought firecrackers, and rockets, and fireworks of every sort, loaded his trunk with them, and flew over the town.</p>
<p>Pop! went the crackers, and swoosh! went the rockets. The Turks jumped so high that their slippers flopped over their ears. Such shooting stars they never had seen. Now they could understand that it was the prophet of the Turks himself who was to marry their Princess.</p>
<p>As soon as the merchant's son came down in the woods, he thought, "I'll go straight to the town to hear what sort of impression I made." It was the natural thing to do.</p>
<p>Oh, what stories they told! Every last man he asked had his own version, but all agreed it had been fine. Very fine!</p>
<p>"I saw the prophet himself," said one. "His eyes shone like stars, and his beard foamed like water."</p>
<p>"He was wrapped in a fiery cloak," said another. "The heads of beautiful angels peeped out of the folds of it."</p>
<p>Yes, he heard wonderful things, and his wedding was to be on the following day. He went back to the woods to rest in his trunk-but what had become of it? The trunk was burned! A spark from the fireworks had set it on fire, and now the trunk was burned to ashes. He couldn't fly any more. He had no way to reach his bride. She waited for him on the roof, all day long. Most likely she is waiting there still. But he wanders through the world, telling tales which are not half so merry as that one he told about the matches.</p></div>
