<p>皇帝的新装，是丹麦著名童话作家安徒生(Hans Christian Andersen)的代表作之一。这个有趣的童话为我们描绘了这样一个故事：一位奢侈的国王每天只顾着穿衣服，不管其他任何事，后竟然还受骗，什么都没穿去游行！没有人去揭穿谎言，甚至还夸耀，后一个孩子天真的一句话才结束了这场闹剧。</p>

<h2 id="plot"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes">Plot</a></h2>
<p>A vain emperor who cares too much about wearing and displaying clothes hires two weavers who claim to make the most beautiful clothes and elaborate patterns. The weavers are con-men who convince the emperor they are using a fine fabric invisible to anyone who is either unfit for his position or "hopelessly stupid". The con lies in that the weavers are actually only pretending to manufacture the clothes. Thus, no one, not even the emperor nor his ministers can see the alleged "clothes", but they all pretend that they can for fear of appearing unfit for their positions. Finally, the weavers report that the suit is finished and they mime dressing the emperor who then marches in procession before his subjects. The townsfolk uncomfortably go along with the pretense, not wanting to appear unfit for their positions or stupid. Finally, a child in the crowd blurts out that the emperor is wearing nothing at all and the cry is then taken up by others. The emperor realizes the assertion is true but continues the procession. </p>

<p>Many years ago there lived an emperor who <strong>was so exceedingly 极度地 fond of</strong> (喜欢) beautiful new clothes that he spent all his money just on <strong>dressing up 打扮</strong>. He <strong>paid no attention to</strong> (不关心) his soldiers, <strong>nor</strong> (也不) did he care about plays or taking drives in the woods <strong>except for</strong> (要不是由于，除非) the sole purpose of <strong>showing off</strong> (炫耀) his new clothes. He had a <strong>robe</strong> (/rəʊb/礼袍) for every hour of the day, and just as it is said of a king that he is "<strong>in council</strong>" (/'kaʊns(ə)l; -sɪl/n. 会议；理事会), 就像有人说国王“在开会”, so they always said here:"The emperor is in the <strong>clothes closet</strong> (橱柜 / locker room 更衣室!)"</p>
<p>许多年前，有一个皇帝，为了穿得漂亮，不惜把所有的钱都花掉。他既不关心他的军队，也不喜欢去看戏，也不喜欢乘着马车去游公园——除非是为了去炫耀一下他的新衣服。他每一天每个小时都要换一套衣服，就像有人说国王“在开会”。人们提到他，总是说：“皇上在更衣室里。”</p>
<p>In the great city where he lived everybody <strong>had a very good time</strong> (过得很愉快). Many visitors came there every day. One day two <strong>charlatans</strong> (/'ʃɑːlət(ə)n/江湖骗子) came. They <strong>passed themselves off as</strong> (pass off as 充作/自称) weavers and said that they knew how to weave the most <strong>exquisite</strong> (/'ekskwɪzɪt; ɪk'skwɪzɪt/精美的) cloth <strong>imaginable</strong> (/ɪ'mædʒɪnəbl/可想象的). <strong>Not only</strong> were the colors and the <strong>pattern</strong> (/ˈpætərn/图案,款式) uncommonly beautiful <strong>but also</strong> the clothes that <strong>were made from</strong> the cloth had the <strong>singular 非凡的；异常的 quality 特性</strong> of being <strong>invisible</strong> to every person who <strong>was unfit for his post</strong> or else was inadmissably (<strong>inadmissible 不可接纳的/ inadmissibly</strong>) stupid.</p>
<p>在他居住的大城市里，每个人都过得很愉快。每天有许多游客去那里。有一天，他的京城来了两个骗子，自称是织工，说能织出人间最美丽的布。这种布不仅色彩和图案都分外美观，而且缝出来的衣服还有一种奇怪的特性：任何不称职的或者愚蠢得不可救药的人，都看不见这衣服。</p>
<p>"Well, these are some <strong>splendid</strong> (极好的,杰出的) clothes," thought the emperor. "With them on I could find out which men in my kingdom were not suited for the posts they have; I can <strong>tell</strong> (辨别) the wise ones <strong>from</strong> the stupid! Yes, that cloth must be woven for me at once!" And he gave the two charlatans lots of money <strong>in advance</strong> so they could begin their work.</p>
<p>“那真是理想的衣服!”皇帝心里想，“我穿了这样的衣服，就可以看出在我的王国里哪些人不称职；我就可以辨别出哪些是聪明人，哪些是傻子。是的，我要叫他们马上为我织出这样的布来。”于是他付了许多钱给这两个骗子，好让他们马上开始工作。</p>
<p>They <strong>put up</strong> two looms, <strong>all right</strong> (一切顺利), and <strong>pretended</strong> to be working, but they had <strong>nothing whatsoever</strong> (没有丝毫东西) on the looms. Without <strong>ceremony</strong> (客套、典礼) they demanded the finest silk and the most <strong>magnificent</strong> (华丽的) gold <strong>thread</strong>. This they put in their own pockets and <strong>worked at</strong> the empty looms <strong>until far into the night</strong>.</p>
<p>他们摆出两架织布机，装作是在工作的样子，可是他们的织布机上连一点东西的影子也没有。他们急迫地请求发给他们一些最优质的蚕丝和最好的金线。他们把这些东西都装进自己的腰包，只在那两架空织布机上忙忙碌碌，直到深夜。</p>
<p>"Now I'd like to see <strong>how far</strong> (到什么程度、多远) they've <strong>come with</strong> the cloth!" thought the emperor. But it made him feel a little <strong>uneasy</strong> (心神不安的、惴惴不安) to think that anyone who are stupid or unfit for his post couldn't see it. Of course he didn't believe that he himself needed to be afraid. <strong>Nonetheless</strong> (/nʌnðə'les/conj. 尽管如此，但是) he wanted to send someone else first to see <strong>how things stood</strong>. The whole city knew of the <strong>remarkable</strong> (非凡的) powers <strong>possessed</strong> by the cloth, and everyone was eager to see how bad or stupid his neighbor was.</p>
<p>“我倒很想知道衣料究竟织得怎样了。”皇帝想。不过，想起凡是愚蠢或不称职的人就看不见这布，心里的确感到不大自然。他相信自己是无须害怕的，但仍然觉得先派一个人去看看工作的进展情形比较妥当。全城的人都听说这织品有一种多么神奇的力量，所以大家也都渴望借这个机会测验一下：他们的邻人究竟有多么笨，或者有多么傻。</p>
<p>"I'll send my <strong>honest</strong> (诚实的) old <strong>minister</strong> (大臣) to the weavers, thought the emperor. "He's the best one to see how the cloth looks, for he has brains and no one is better fitted for his post than he is!"</p>
<p>“我要派我诚实的老大臣到织工那儿去。”皇帝想，“他最能看出这布料是什么样子，因为他很有理智，就称职这点说，谁也不及他。”</p>
<p>Now the <strong>harmless</strong> (/'hɑ:mləs/adj. 无害的；无恶意的) old minister went into the <strong>hall</strong> (礼堂、大厅) where the two charlatans sat working at the empty looms.</p>
<p>这位善良的老大臣来到那两个骗子的屋子里，看见他们正在空织布机上忙碌地工作。</p>
<p>"<strong>Heaven help us!</strong>" thought the old minister, his eyes opening wide. "Why, I can't see anything!" But he didn't say so.</p>
<p>“愿上帝可怜我吧!”老大臣想，他把眼睛睁得特别大，“我什么东西也没有看见!”但是他没敢把这句话说出口来。</p>
<p>Both the charlatans asked him to please step closer and asked if it didn't have a beautiful pattern and lovely colors. Then they pointed to the empty loom, and the poor old minister kept opening his eyes wider. But he couldn't see a thing, for there was nothing there.</p>
<p>皇帝的新装那两个骗子请他走近一点，同时指着那两架空织布机问他花纹是不是很美丽，色彩是不是很漂亮。可怜的老大臣眼睛越睁越大，仍然看不见什么东西，因为的确没有东西。</p>
<p>"Good Lord!" he thought. "Am I <strong>supposed to be</strong> ( 本应如此) stupid? I never thought so, and <code>not a **soul** (灵魂、某种人) must find it out!</code> Am I unfit for my post? No, <strong>it'll never do for me</strong> to say that I can't see the cloth!"</p>
<p>“我的老天爷!”他想，“难道我是愚蠢的吗?我从来没有怀疑过自己。这一点决不能让任何人知道。难道我是不称职的吗?不成!我决不能让人知道我看不见布料。”</p>
<p>"Well, you're not saying anything about it!" said the one who was weaving.</p>
<p>“哎，您一点意见也没有吗?”一个正在织布的骗子说。</p>
<p>"Oh, it's nice! Quite <strong>charming</strong> (/'tʃɑːmɪŋ/adj. 迷人的；可爱的)!" said the old minister, and <strong>peered</strong> (凝视) through his <strong>spectacles</strong> (/'spektək(ə)lz/n.眼镜（spectacle景象、场面；~s复数眼镜）). "This pattern and these colors! Yes, I shall tell the emperor that <strong>it pleases me highly!</strong>"</p>
<p>“哎呀，美极了!真是美极了!”老大臣一边说，一边从他的眼镜里仔细地看，“多么美的花纹!多么美的色彩!是的，我将要呈报皇上，我对这布料非常满意。”</p>
<p>"Well, we're <strong>delighted</strong> to hear it!" said both the weavers, and now they <strong>named</strong> the colors by name and described the <strong>singular</strong> <strong>pattern</strong>. The old minister <strong>paid close attention</strong> so he could repeat it all when he <strong>came back to</strong> the emperor. <strong>And this he did.</strong></p>
<p>“嗯，我们听了非常高兴。”两个骗子齐声说。于是他们就把色彩和稀有的花纹描述了一番，还加上些名词。老大臣注意地听着，以便回到皇帝那儿可以照样背出来。事实上他也这样做了。</p>
<p>Now the charlatans <strong>demanded</strong> more money for more silk and gold thread, which they were going to use for the weaving. They <strong>stuffed</strong> everything into their own pockets. Not a thread went onto the looms, but they <strong>kept on</strong> weaving on the empty looms as before.</p>
<p>这两个骗子又要了更多的钱，更多的生丝和金子，说是为了织布的需要。他们把这些东西全装进了腰包。织布机上没有一根线，但是他们仍然像以前一样在空空的织布机上织布。</p>
<p>Soon <strong>afterward</strong> (adv. 以后) the emperor sent another harmless <strong>official</strong> (官员) there to see how the weaving was <strong>coming along</strong> (进展) and if the cloth should soon be ready. The same thing happened to him as to the minister. He looked and he looked, but as there was nothing there <strong>but</strong> (prep. 除…以外) the empty looms, he couldn't see a thing.</p>
<p>过了不久，皇帝又派了另外一位诚实的官员去看工作进行的情况，是否布料很快就能做好。这位官员的运气并不比头一位大臣好：他看了又看，但是那两架空织布机上什么也没有，他什么东西也看不出来。</p>
<p>"Well, isn't it a beautiful piece of cloth?" both the charlatans said, and showed and explained the lovely pattern that wasn't there <strong>at all</strong> (&lt;否定句&gt;根本).</p>
<p>“你看这段布美不美?”两个骗子问。他们指着，描述着一些美丽的花纹但事实上它们并不存在。</p>
<p>"Well, I'm not stupid!" thought the man. "Then it's my good position that I'm unfit for? <strong>That is strange enough</strong>, but I must be careful not to show it!" And so he praised the cloth he didn't see and <strong>assured</strong> (使确信) them how <strong>delighted</strong> he was <strong>with</strong> the beautiful colors and the lovely pattern. "Yes, it's quite charming!" he said to the emperor.</p>
<p>“我并不愚蠢呀!”这位官员想，“这大概是我不配有现在这样好的官职吧。这也真够滑稽，但是我决不能让人看出来。”他就把他完全没看见的布称赞了一番，同时保证说，他对这些美丽的色彩和巧妙的花纹感到很满意。“是的，那真是太美了!”他对皇帝说。</p>
<p>All the people in the city were talking about the <strong>magnificent</strong> (/mæg'nɪfɪs(ə)nt/华丽的) cloth.</p>
<p>城里所有的人都在谈论着这美丽的布料。</p>
<p>Now the emperor himself wanted to see it while it was still on the loom. With a whole <strong>crowd</strong> (人群) of <strong>hand-picked</strong> (adj.精选的；用手挑选的) men, <strong>among</strong> them the two harmless old officials who had been there before, he went to where the two <strong>sly</strong> charlatans were now weaving <strong>with all their might</strong> (全力以赴), but without a <strong>stitch</strong> (/stɪtʃ/一针) or a thread.</p>
<p>皇帝很想亲自去看一次。他选了一群特别圈定的随员其中包括已经去看过的那两位诚实的大臣。他就到那两个狡猾的骗子那里。这两个家伙正在以全副精力织布，但是一根丝的影子也看不见。</p>
<p>"Yes, isn't it magnifique (magnificent)?" said the two honest officials. "Will your <strong>majesty</strong> (/'mædʒəsti/陛下) look - what a pattern, what colors!" And then they <strong>pointed to</strong> the empty looms, for they thought that the others were <strong>certainly</strong> (必定) able to see the cloth.</p>
<p>“您看这布华丽不华丽?”那两位诚实的官员说，“陛下请看：多么美的花纹!多么美的色彩!”他们指着那架空织布机，他们相信别人一定看得见布料。</p>
<p>"<strong>What's this?</strong>" thought the emperor. "I don't see anything! Why, this is <strong>dreadful</strong> (糟透的)! Am I stupid? Am I not fit to be emperor? This is the most <strong>horrible</strong> (可怕的) thing that could happen to me!?</p>
<p>“这是怎么一回事呢?”皇帝心里想，“我什么也没有看见!这可骇人听闻了。难道我是一个愚蠢的人吗?难道我不够资格当皇帝吗?这可是最可怕的事情。”</p>
<p>"Oh, it's quite beautiful!" said the emperor. "It has my highest <strong>approval</strong> (认可)!" And he <strong>nodded</strong> (nod /nɒd/ 点头) <strong>contentedly</strong> (/kən'tɛntɪdli/ 满足地) and <strong>regarded</strong> (注视) the empty looms. He didn't want to say that he couldn't see a thing. The <strong>entire</strong> (全部的) <strong>company</strong> (同伴) he had brought with him looked and looked, but they weren't able to <strong>make any more out of it</strong> than the others. Yet, like the emperor, they said, "Oh, it's quite beautiful!" And they <strong>advised</strong> (建议) him to have clothes <strong>made of</strong> the magnificent new cloth in time for the great <strong>procession</strong> (游行) that was <strong>forthcoming</strong> (即将来临的).</p>
<p>“哎呀，真是美极了!”皇帝说，“我十二分满意!” 于是他点头表示满意。他仔细地看着织布机，他不愿说出什么也没看到。跟着他来的全体随员也仔细地看了又看，可是他们也没比别人看到更多的东西。他们像皇帝一样，也说：“哎呀，真是美极了!”他们向皇帝建议，用这新的、美丽的布料做成衣服，穿着这衣服去参加快要举行的游行大典。</p>
<p>"It is magnifique! Exquisite! Excellent!" <strong>passed from mouth to mouth</strong>. And every one of them was so <strong>fervently</strong> (/'fə:vəntli/热心地) delighted with it. <strong>Upon</strong> (此后) each of the charlatans the emperor <strong>bestowed</strong> (/bɪ'stəʊ/ 授予) a badge of <strong>knighthood</strong> (骑士) to hang in his buttonhole, and the title of "Weaver-<strong>Junker</strong>."</p>
<p>“这布是华丽的!精致的!无双的!”每人都随声附和着。每人都有说不出的快乐。皇帝赐给骗子“御聘织师”的头衔，封他们为爵士，并授予一枚可以挂在扣眼上的勋章。</p>
<p>All night long, before the morning of the procession, the charlatans <strong>sat up</strong> with more than sixteen candles burning. People could see that they were busy finishing the emperor's new clothes. They acted <strong>as if</strong> they were taking the cloth from the looms, they <strong>clipped</strong> (剪) in the air with big scissors, they <strong>sewed</strong> (缝纫) with <strong>needles</strong> (针) without thread, and at last they said, "see, now the clothes are ready!"</p>
<p>第二天早上，游行大典就要举行了。头一天夜晚，两个骗子整夜点起十六支以上的蜡烛。人们可以看到他们是在赶夜工，要把皇帝的新衣完成。他们装作从织布机上取下布料，用两把大剪刀在空中裁了一阵子，同时用没有穿线的针缝了一通。最后，他们齐声说：“请看!新衣服缝好了!”</p>
<p>With his highest <strong>gentlemen-in-waiting</strong> the emperor came there himself and both the charlatans lifted an arm in the air as if they were holding something and said, "See, here are the knee <strong>breeches</strong> (马裤)! Here's the <strong>tailcoat</strong>! Here's the <strong>cloak</strong> (披风)!" And so on.</p>
<p>皇帝亲自带着他的最高贵的侍从来到那里。两个骗子都举起一只胳膊，好像拿着什么东西似的，说:“看，这是齐膝马裤！这是燕尾服！这是披风！”等等。</p>
<p>"It's <strong>as light as</strong> a <strong>spider's web</strong>! You'd think you had nothing on, but that's the beauty of it!"</p>
<p>“这些衣服轻柔得像蜘蛛网一样，穿的人会觉得好像身上没有什么东西似的，这也正是这些衣服的优点。”</p>
<p>"Yes," said all the gentlemen-in-waiting, but they couldn't see a thing, for there was nothing there.</p>
<p>“一点也不错。”所有的骑士都说。可是他们什么也看不见，因为什么东西也没有。</p>
<p>"Now, if your majesty would most <strong>graciously</strong> (雅致地有风度地) <strong>consent</strong> (同意，准许) to <strong>take off</strong> (脱掉) your clothes," said the charlatans, we will help you on with the new ones here in front of the big mirror!"</p>
<p>“现在请皇上脱下衣服，”两个骗子说，“好让我们在这个大镜子面前为您换上新衣。”</p>
<p>The emperor took off all his clothes, and the charlatans acted as if they were handing him each of the new <strong>garments</strong> (服装) that had <strong>supposedly</strong> been sewed. And they put their arms around his waist as if they were tying something on - that was the <strong>train</strong> (裙裾) - and the emperor turned and <strong>twisted</strong> (扭动) in front of the mirror.</p>
<p>皇帝把他所有的衣服都脱下来了。两个骗子装作一件一件地把他们刚才缝好的新衣服交给他。他们在他的腰周围弄了一阵子，好像是为他系上一件什么东西似的----这就是后裙。皇上在镜子面前转了转身子，扭了扭腰。</p>
<p>"Heavens, <strong>how well it becomes you!</strong> How splendidly it fits!" they all said. "What a pattern! What colors! That's a magnificent <strong>outfit</strong>!"</p>
<p>“上帝，这衣服多么合身啊!裁得多么好看啊!”大家都说，“多么美的花纹!多么美的色彩!这真是贵重的衣服。”</p>
<p>"They are waiting outside with the <strong>canopy</strong> (/'kænəpi/华盖) that is to be <strong>carried over</strong> your majesty in the procession," said the <strong>chief master of ceremonies</strong>.</p>
<p>“大家都在外面等待，准备好了华盖，以便举在陛下头顶上去参加游行大典。”典礼官说。</p>
<p>"Well, I'm ready!" said the emperor. "Isn't it a nice fit?"</p>
<p>“对，我已经穿好了。”皇帝说，“这衣服合我的身吗?”</p>
<p>And then he turned around in front of the mirror just one more time, so it should really look as if he were regarding his <strong>finery</strong> (华丽的服饰).</p>
<p>于是他又在镜子面前把身子转动了一下，因为他要使大家觉得他在认真地观看他的美丽的新装。</p>
<p>The gentlemen-in-waiting, who were to carry the train, <strong>fumbled</strong> (摸索) down on the floor with their hands just as if they were <strong>picking up</strong> the train. They walked and held their arms high in the air. They <strong>dared</strong> (敢于) not let it <strong>appear</strong> (出现、显得) as if they couldn't see a thing.</p>
<p>那些托后裙的内臣都把手在地上东摸西摸，好像他们正在拾起衣裙似的。他们开步走，手中托着空气。他们不敢让人瞧出他们实在什么东西也没看见。</p>
<p>And then the emperor walked in the procession under the beautiful canopy. And all the people in the street and at the windows said, "Heavens, how wonderful the emperor's new clothes are! What a lovely train he has on the robe! What a <strong>marvelous</strong> (/'mɑrvələs/adj. 了不起的；非凡的；令人惊异的；不平常的) fit!" No one wanted it to appear that he couldn't see anything, <strong>for then of course</strong> he would have been unfit for his position or very stupid. None of the emperor's clothes has ever been such a success.</p>
<p>这样，皇帝就在那个富丽的华盖下游行起来了。站在街上和窗子里的人都说：“乖乖!皇上的新装真是漂亮!他上衣下面的后裙是多么美丽!这件衣服真合他的身材!”谁也不愿意让人知道自己什么也看不见，因为这样就会显出自己不称职，或是太愚蠢。皇帝所有的衣服从来没有获得过这样的称赞。</p>
<p>"But he doesn't have anything on!" said a little child.</p>
<p>“可是他什么衣服也没穿呀!”一个小孩子最后叫了出来。</p>
<p>"Heavens, listen to the <strong>innocent</strong>'s (n.天真的人；adj.无知的) voice!" said the father, and then the child's words were <strong>whispered</strong> (v.窃窃私语、低声地说) from one to another.</p>
<p>“上帝哟，你听这个天真的声音!”爸爸说。于是大家把这孩子讲的话私下里低声地传播开来。</p>
<p>"He doesn't have anything on! That's what a little child is saying - he doesn't have anything on!"</p>
<p>“他并没穿什么衣服!有一个小孩子说他并没穿什么衣服呀!”</p>
<p>"He doesn't have anything on!" the whole <strong>populace</strong> (大众、平民; civilian /səˈvɪliən/ 平民, citizen市民, burgher公民) shouted <strong>at last</strong>. And the emperor <strong>shuddered</strong> (战栗、发抖), for it seemed to him that they were right. But then he thought, "Now I must <strong>go through</strong> with the procession." And he carried himself <strong>more proudly than ever</strong>, and the gentlemen-in-waiting carried the train that wasn't there <strong>at all</strong> (&lt;否定句&gt;根本).</p>
<p>“他实在没穿什么衣服呀!”最后所有的百姓都说。皇帝有点儿发抖，因为他觉得百姓们所讲的话似乎是真的。不过他心里却这样想：“我必须把这游行大典举行完毕。”因此他摆出一副更骄傲的神气。他的内臣们跟在他后面走，手中托着一条并不存在的后裙。</p>

<p>Many years ago, there was an emperor to wear pretty, do not hesitate to put all the money. He did not care about his army, nor did he like to go to the theatre, and he did not like to go to the park by coach, unless it was to show off his new clothes. He has to change his clothes every hour of the day. People mentioned him, always said: "the emperor in the locker room. "
One day, his capital to the two swindlers, claiming to be the weaver, can weave the most beautiful cloth. This cloth is not only the colors and the patterns are exceptionally beautiful and sew clothes and a strange characteristic: any incompetent or stupid person, see not see the clothes.
"That's really good clothes," said the emperor, "I can see who is not competent in my kingdom, and I can tell what is a wise man, and what is a fool. Yes, I want to call them immediately as I weave the cloth." So he paid a lot of money to the two cheats, so that they would start working right away.
They set up two looms and pretended to be working, but they did not have the shadow of a little thing on their loom. An urgent request that they give some of the finest silk and the best gold. They put these things into their own pockets, only in the bustling about two overhead looms until late at night.
"I'd like to know exactly how well woven cloth." The emperor thought. However, think of any stupid or incompetent person can not see this cloth, in the heart really feel not natural. He believes he is not afraid of, but still feel that the first to send a person to see the progress of the work of the situation is more appropriate. All the people throughout the city had heard of this fabric has a wonderful power, so we are eager to borrow this opportunity to test: their neighbors how stupid or silly.
"I will send my honest old minister to the weavers." The emperor thought, "he can see what the cloth is like, because he is very sensible, he is competent to say, who is not as good as him."
The good old minister came into the house of the two cheats, and saw them working on the empty looms.
"May God have mercy on me," said the boss, who had his eyes open, "I didn't see anything!" but he didn't dare to say anything about it.

The two cheats asked him to approach a little, and at the same time pointed to the two overhead loom asked him whether the pattern is very beautiful, the color is not very beautiful. The eyes of the poor old minister, the more open, still can not see anything, because there is no thing.
"My God!" he thought, "is it stupid of me? I have never doubted myself. This will never let anyone know. Am I not good at it? No, I can't let people know that I can't see the cloth."
"Well, don't you have any suggestions?" said a liar in a loom.
"Oh, how beautiful! Is really beautiful!" the old minister spoke, aside from his glasses look carefully, "what a beautiful pattern! How beautiful colors! Yes, I'm going to reported to the emperor, I on the cloth very satisfied."
"Well, we were very happy to hear that." Two swindlers said in unison. So they gave a description of the color and the rare pattern, and added some nouns. The old minister listened carefully so that he could come back to the emperor. In fact, he did it.
The two swindlers have more money, more silk and gold, said that the need for weaving. They put all these things in their pockets.
Soon after, the emperor sent another honest official to see the work. The official's luck was not better than the first minister: he looked and looked, but there was nothing on the two looms, and he could not see anything.
"Do you look at this cloth beauty is not beautiful?" the two cheats asked. They pointed to some beautiful patterns, but in fact they did not exist.
"I am not stupid!" the officials think, "this is probably I don't deserve to have such a good post. What a funny thing, but I never let a person see." He praised the cloth that he had not seen completely, and assured him that he was satisfied with the beautiful colors and clever patterns. "Yes, it was so beautiful," he said to the emperor.
All the people in the city are talking about this beautiful cloth.
The emperor wanted to see it in person. He selected a group of special delineation of attendants including already seen to be honest the two ministers. And he went to the two cunning liars. These two guys are weaving with all the energy, but a piece of silk can not see the shadow.
"You do not see this cloth is gorgeous?" the two honest officials said, "Your Majesty please see: what a beautiful pattern! How beautiful the color!" they pointed to the overhead loom, they believe that others will see the cloth.
"What is this?" thought the emperor, "what I didn't see! This frightful to the ear. Am I a fool? Do I not be qualified to be an emperor? This is the most terrible thing." "Oh, how beautiful!" said the emperor, "I am satisfied with twelve!"
So he nodded his head and said he was satisfied. He looked at the loom carefully, and he didn't want to say anything. Follow him all his attendants also looked and looked, but they didn't see more than others</p>

<p>许多年前，有一个皇帝，为了穿得漂亮，不惜把所有的钱都花掉。他既不关心他的军队，也不喜欢去看戏，也不喜欢乘着马车去游公园——除非是为了去炫耀一下他的新衣服。他每一天每个小时都要换一套衣服。人们提到他，总是说：“皇上在更衣室里。“</p>
<p>有一天，他的京城来了两个骗子，自称是织工，说能织出人间最美丽的布。这种布不仅色彩和图案都分外美观，而且缝出来的衣服还有一种奇怪的特性：任何不称职的或者愚蠢得不可救药的人，都看不见这衣服。</p>
<p>“那真是理想的衣服!”皇帝心里想，“我穿了这样的衣服，就可以看出在我的王国里哪些人不称职；我就可以辨别出哪些是聪明人，哪些是傻子。是的，我要叫他们马上为我织出这样的布来。”于是他付了许多钱给这两个骗子，好让他们马上开始工作。</p>
<p>他们摆出两架织布机，装作是在工作的样子，可是他们的织布机上连一点东西的影子也没有。他们急迫地请求发给他们一些最细的生丝和最好的金子。他们把这些东西都装进自己的腰包，只在那两架空织布机上忙忙碌碌，直到深夜。</p>
<p>“我倒很想知道衣料究竟织得怎样了。”皇帝想。不过，想起凡是愚蠢或不称职的人就看不见这布，心里的确感到不大自然。他相信自己是无须害怕的，但仍然觉得先派一个人去看看工作的进展情形比较妥当。全城的人都听说这织品有一种多么神奇的力量，所以大家也都渴望借这个机会测验一下：他们的邻人究竟有多么笨，或者有多么傻。</p>
<p>“我要派我诚实的老大臣到织工那儿去。”皇帝想，“他最能看出这布料是什么样子，因为他很有理智，就称职这点说，谁也不及他。”</p>
<p>这位善良的老大臣来到那两个骗子的屋子里，看见他们正在空织布机上忙碌地工作。</p>
<p>“愿上帝可怜我吧!”老大臣想，他把眼睛睁得特别大，“我什么东西也没有看见!”但是他没敢把这句话说出口来。</p>
<p>皇帝的新装那两个骗子请他走近一点，同时指着那两架空织布机问他花纹是不是很美丽，色彩是不是很漂亮。可怜的老大臣眼睛越睁越大，仍然看不见什么东西，因为的确没有东西。</p>
<p>“我的老天爷!”他想，“难道我是愚蠢的吗?我从来没有怀疑过自己。这一点决不能让任何人知道。难道我是不称职的吗?不成!我决不能让人知道我看不见布料。”</p>
<p>“哎，您一点意见也没有吗?”一个正在织布的骗子说。</p>
<p>“哎呀，美极了!真是美极了!”老大臣一边说，一边从他的眼镜里仔细地看，“多么美的花纹!多么美的色彩!是的，我将要呈报皇上，我对这布料非常满意。”</p>
<p>“嗯，我们听了非常高兴。”两个骗子齐声说。于是他们就把色彩和稀有的花纹描述了一番，还加上些名词。老大臣注意地听着，以便回到皇帝那儿可以照样背出来。事实上他也这样做了。</p>
<p>这两个骗子又要了更多的钱，更多的生丝和金子，说是为了织布的需要。他们把这些东西全装进了腰包。</p>
<p>过了不久，皇帝又派了另外一位诚实的官员去看工作进行的情况。这位官员的运气并不比头一位大臣好：他看了又看，但是那两架空织布机上什么也没有，他什么东西也看不出来。</p>
<p>“你看这段布美不美?”两个骗子问。他们指着，描述着一些美丽的花纹但事实上它们并不存在。</p>
<p>“我并不愚蠢呀!”这位官员想，“这大概是我不配有现在这样好的官职吧。这也真够滑稽，但是我决不能让人看出来。”他就把他完全没看见的布称赞了一番，同时保证说，他对这些美丽的色彩和巧妙的花纹感到很满意。“是的，那真是太美了!”他对皇帝说。</p>
<p>城里所有的人都在谈论着这美丽的布料。</p>
<p>皇帝很想亲自去看一次。他选了一群特别圈定的随员其中包括已经去看过的那两位诚实的大臣。他就到那两个狡猾的骗子那里。这两个家伙正在以全副精力织布，但是一根丝的影子也看不见。</p>
<p>“您看这布华丽不华丽?”那两位诚实的官员说，“陛下请看：多么美的花纹!多么美的色彩!”他们指着那架空织布机，他们相信别人一定看得见布料。</p>
<p>“这是怎么一回事呢?”皇帝心里想，“我什么也没有看见!这可骇人听闻了。难道我是一个愚蠢的人吗?难道我不够资格当皇帝吗?这可是最可怕的事情。”“哎呀，真是美极了!”皇帝说，“我十二分满意!”</p>
<p>于是他点头表示满意。他仔细地看着织布机，他不愿说出什么也没看到。跟着他来的全体随员也仔细地看了又看，可是他们也没比别人看到更多的东西。他们像皇帝一样，也说：“哎呀，真是美极了!”他们向皇帝建议，用这新的、美丽的布料做成衣服，穿着这衣服去参加快要举行的游行大典。“这布是华丽的!精致的!无双的!”每人都随声附和着。每人都有说不出的快乐。皇帝赐给骗子“御聘织师”的头衔，封他们为爵士，并授予一枚可以挂在扣眼上的勋章。</p>
<p>第二天早上，游行大典就要举行了。头一天夜晚，两个骗子整夜点起十六支以上的蜡烛。人们可以看到他们是在赶夜工，要把皇帝的新衣完成。他们装作从织布机上取下布料，用两把大剪刀在空中裁了一阵子，同时用没有穿线的针缝了一通。最后，他们齐声说：“请看!新衣服缝好了!”</p>
<p>皇帝亲自带着一群最高贵的骑士们来了。两个骗子各举起一只手，好像拿着一件什么东西似的。他们说：“请看吧，这是裤子，这是袍子，这是外衣。”“这些衣服轻柔得像蜘蛛网一样，穿的人会觉得好像身上没有什么东西似的，这也正是这些衣服的优点。”</p>
<p>“一点也不错。”所有的骑士都说。可是他们什么也看不见，因为什么东西也没有。</p>

<h2 id="version-3-from-internet">Version 3 from Internet</h2>
<p>Many years ago / Long ago / Once upon a time, there lived an emperor, who cared so enormously for beautiful new clothes that he spent all his money upon them, that he might be very fine. He did not care about his soldiers, nor about the theatre, nor about driving in the park except to show his new clothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day; and just as they say of a king,“ He is in council, ” one always said of him, “ The emperor is in the wardrobe.”</p>
<p>In the great city in which he lived it was always very merry; every day a number of strangers arrived there. One day two cheats came: they gave themselves out as weavers, and declared that they could weave the finest stuff anyone could imagine. Not only were their colours and patterns, they said, uncommonly beautiful, but the clothes made of the stuff possessed the wonderful quality that they became invisible to anyone who was unfit for the office he held, or was incorrigibly stupid.</p>
<p>“Those would be capital clothes!” thought the emperor.“If I wore those, I should be able to find out what men in my empire are not fit for the places they have; I could distinguish the clever from the stupid. Yes, the stuff must be woven for me directly! ”</p>
<p>And he gave the two cheats a great deal of cash in hand, that they might begin their work at once.</p>
<p>As for them, they put up two looms, and pretended to working; but they had nothing at all on their looms. They at once demanded the finest silk and the costliest gold; this they put into their own pockets, and worked at the empty looms till late into the night.</p>
<p>“I should like to know how far they have got on with the stuff,” thought the emperor. But he felt quite uncomfortable when he thought that those who were not fit for their offices could not see it. He believed, indeed, that he had nothing to fear for himself, but yet he preferred first to send some one else to see how matters stood. All the people in the whole city knew what peculiar power the stuff possessed, and all were anxious to see how bad or how stupid their neighbours were.</p>
<p>“I will send my honest old minister to the weavers, ” thought the emperor.“He can judge best how the stuff looks, for he has sense, and no one discharges his office better than he.”</p>
<p>Now the good old minister went out ino the hall where the two cheats sat working at the empty looms.</p>
<p>“Mercy preserve us!” thought the old minister, and he opened his eyes wide.</p>
<p>“I cannot see anything at all!” But he did not say this.</p>
<p>Both the cheats begged him to be kind enough to come nearer, and asked if he did not approve of the colours and the pattern. Then they pointed to the empty loom, and the poor old minister went on opening his eyes; but he could see nothing, for there was nothing to see.</p>
<p>“Mercy!” thought he, “can I indeed be so stupid? I never thought that, and not a sould must know it. Am I not fit for my office?－No, it wil never do for me to tell that I could not see the stuff.”</p>
<p>“Do you say nothing to it?” said one of the weavers.</p>
<p>“Oh, it is charming－quite enchanting!” answered the old minister, as he peered through his spectacles. “What a fine pattern, and what colours! Yes, I shall tell the emperor that I am very much pleased with it.”</p>
<p>“Well, we are glad for that, ”said both the weavers; and then they named the colours, and explained the strange pattern. The old minister listened attentively, that he might be able to repeat it when he went back to the emperor. And he did so.</p>
<p>Now the cheats asked for more money, and more silk and gold, which they declared they wanted for weaving. They put all into their own pockets, and not a thread was put upon the loom; but they continued to work at the empty frames as before.</p>
<p>The emperor soon sent again, dispatching another honest statesman, to see how the weaving was going on, and if the stuff would soon be ready. He fared just like the first: he looked and looked, but, as there was nothing to be seen but the empty looms, he could see nothing.</p>
<p>“Is not that a pretty piece of stuff?” asked the two cheats; and they displayed and explained the handsome pattern which was not there at all.</p>
<p>“I am not stupid!” thought the man－“it must be my good office, for which I am not fit. It is funny enough, but I must not let it be noticed.” And so he praised the stuff which he did not see, and expressed his pleasure at the beautiful colours and the charming pattern. “Yes, it is enchanting, ” he said to the emperor.</p>
<p>All the people in the town were talking of the gorgeous stuff. The emperor wished to see if himself while it was still upon the loom. With a whole crowd of chosen men, among whom were also the two honest statesmen who had already been there, he went to the two cunning cheats, who were now weaving with might and main without fibre or thread.</p>
<p>“Is that not splendid?” said the two old statesmen, who had already been there once.“ Does not your majesty remark the pattern and the colours?” And then they pointed to the empty loom, for they thought that the others could see the stuff.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” thought the emperor. “I can see nothing at all! That is terrible. Am I stupid? Am I not fit to be emperor? That would be the most dreadful thing that could happen to me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it is very pretty!” he said aloud. “It has our exalted approbation.”And he nodded in a contented way, and gazed at the empty loom, for he would not say that he saw nothing. The whole suite whom he had with him looked and looked, and saw nothing, any more than the rest; but, like the emperor, they said,“That is pretty!” and counselled him to wear these splendid new clothes for the first time at the great procession that was presently to take place.“It is splendid, tasteful, excellent!” went from mouth to mouth. On all sides there seemed to be general rejoicing, and the emperor gave each of the cheats a cross to hang at his button-hole and the title of Imperial Court Weaver.</p>
<p>The whole night before the morning on which the procession was to take place the cheats were up, and had lighted more than sixteen candles. The people could see that they were hard at work, completing the emperor’s new clothes. They pretended to take the stuff down from the loom; they made cuts in the air with great scissors; they sewed with needles without thread; and at last they said,“Now the clothes are ready.”</p>
<p>The emperor came himself with his noblest cavaliers; and the two cheats lifted up one arm as if they were holding something, and said, “See, here are the trousers! Here is the coat! Here is the cloak!” and so on. “It is as light as a spider’s web: one would think one had nothing on; but that is just the beauty of it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, ” said all the cavaliers; but they could not see anything, for nothing was there.</p>
<p>“Does your imperial majesty please to condescend to undress?” said the cheats; “then we will put you on the new clothes here in front of the great mirror.”</p>
<p>The emperor took off his clothes, and the cheats pretended to put on him each of the new garments, and they took him round the waist, and seemed to fasten on something; that was the train; and the emperor turned round and round before the mirror.</p>
<p>“Oh, how well they look! How capitally they fit!” said all. “What a pattern! What colours! That is a splendid dress!”</p>
<p>“They are standing outside with the canopy which is to be borne above your majesty in the procession!” announced the head master of the ceremonies.</p>
<p>“Well, I am ready, ”replied the emperor.“Does it not suit me well?” And then he turned again to the mirror, for he wanted it to appear as if he contemplated his adornment with great interest.</p>
<p>The chamberlains, who were to carry the train, stooped down with their hands towards the floor, just as if they were picking up the mantle; then they pretended to be holding something up in the air. They did not dare to let it be noticed that they saw nothing.</p>
<p>So the emperor went in procession under the rich canopy, and every one in the streets said, “ How incomparable are the emperor’s new clothes! What a train he has to his mantle! How it fits him! ” No one would let it be perceived that he could see nothing, for that would have shown that he was not fit for his office, or was very stupid. No clothes of the emperor’s had ever had such a success as these.</p>
<p>“But he has nothing on!” a little child cried out at last.</p>
<p>“Just hear what that innocent says!” said the father and one whispered to another what the child had said. “ There is a little child that says he has nothing on.”</p>
<p>“But he has nothing on!” said the whole people at length. And the emperor shivered, for it seemed to him that they were right; but he thought within himself. “I must go through with the procession.” And so he carried himself still more proudly, and the chamberlains held on tighter than ever, and carried the train which did not exist at all.</p>

<p>A long time ago there was an Emperor who loved new clothes. He spent his whole life searching for new things to wear. He didn’t do any of the things which Emperors are supposed to do. He never visited his army, never made a speech, never opened a newschool or hospital... no, the only time his people saw him was when he walked through the city showing off his newest clothes. People would see him and whisper, ‘Look at his wonderful hat.’ Or ‘Those silk trousers! What beautiful colours!’</p>
<p>One day two strangers arrived in the city. One was a very tall thin man with a long pointed nose. The other, small and round, had not a single hair on his head. The strange pair drove their cart straight to the Emperor’s palace, and asked to see the Emperor.</p>
<p>‘Impossible,’ said the palace gatekeeper. ‘A box of new shoes has just arrived from China and His Majesty will be spending the whole day trying them on. He’ll have no time to see people.’</p>
<p>‘Fine,’ said the tall stranger. ‘Tell your Emperor that he’s just missed the chance to buy the most wonderful, magical clothes the world has ever seen. Goodbye.’</p>
<p>‘Wait,’ said the gatekeeper. ‘Magical, you say? Perhaps His Majesty might spare a moment for you. Wait there.’</p>
<p>Now the Emperor would never miss a chance to buy unusual clothes, so before long the two strangers were standing in front of the great man and his ministers, all eager to see what the two had brought.</p>
<p>‘Your Majesty,’ said the small round stranger, ‘my partner and I have invented a cloth which is not only very beautiful but is also magic. We wondered if Your Majesty might be interested in such a cloth.’</p>
<p>‘Magic?’ said the Emperor pretending not to be very interested. ‘What magic?’ ‘Of course Your Majesty will be able to see our magical cloth but anyone who is stupid or not fi t for his job will see nothing. To stupid people our cloth will be invisible.’</p>
<p>The Emperor sat up very straight. ‘This is brilliant,’ he thought. ‘Here’s a chance to find out which of my people are fi t for their jobs and which of them are fools.’</p>
<p>‘Alright,’ he said. ’Make me some of your magic cloth. Make it for me now.’ ‘It’s not cheap’, said the tall stranger. ‘It’ll cost...</p>
<p>‘It doesn’t matter what it costs,’ said the Emperor. ‘Whatever you ask I’ll pay.’ The strangers were given two bags of gold coins and a room where they could set up their huge wooden looms. Then they locked the door...and started to work. The Emperor listened at the door and smiled excitedly.</p>
<p>‘Good,’ he said. ‘They’ve made a start.’ But... what the Emperor didn’t know was that these two strangers were cheats who had come to trick him. They were just pretending to work. They kept their looms moving but no silk or thread was used and not a stitch of cloth was made. The strangers looked at their empty looms and their two bags of gold and laughed.</p>
<p>‘Enjoying their work,’ said the Emperor. ‘That’s good sign.’ For two days and two nights the Emperor listened to the strangers working and on the third day he sent his Chief Minister to see how they were getting on. The Chief Minister knocked politely on the door.</p>
<p>‘Excuse me,’ he said. ‘May I come in?’ The door opened. ‘Of course,’ said the tall stranger. ‘Come and see the magic cloth. I think you will be quite surprised.’</p>
<p>Well the Chief Minister was surprised. Actually the Chief Minister was horrified because what he saw hanging on the looms was...nothing. He put on his glasses, put his face right up to the loom but he could not see a single thread of cloth. ‘Oh no,’ hethought. ‘This means that I’m a fool and that I’m not fi t to do my job. No-one must know. I must pretend that I see the cloth.’‘So what do you think?’ said the short round stranger.</p>
<p>‘It’s um...beautiful,’ said the Chief Minister. ‘Like the colours?’ said the tall thin stranger. ‘The colours? Oh yes,’ said the Chief Minister. ‘Magnificent. The Emperor is going to just love those colours.’</p>
<p>‘Then tell him he’s going to need to pay us more money,’ said the short round stranger. ‘Magic thread is very expensive. Tell him we need two more bags of gold if we are to make enough cloth for a suit of clothes.’</p>
<p>‘Certainly,’ said the Chief Minister and he scurried back to the Emperor. The Emperor was very excited when he heard about the magnificent cloth and he told a servant to take the strangers two more bags of gold.</p>
<p>‘Put the money on the table,’ said the tall stranger pretending to work on his loom. The servant did as he was told and then took at look at the magic cloth and saw... nothing.</p>
<p>‘Lovely, isn’t it,’ said the short round stranger without looking up from his work. Now the servant didn’t want the whole world to think he was a fool and unfit for his job so of course he said, ‘Oh yes. The most beautiful cloth I have ever seen.’</p>
<p>As he left the room and walked back to the Emperor’s chamber the servant heard the chink of gold coins and the unmistakable sound of laughter.</p>
<p>News of the beautiful magic cloth quickly spread. The Emperor could wait no longer and demanded to see the cloth for himself. So, with all his ministers and his servants following behind, the Emperor went to the strangers’ room and knocked on the door.</p>
<p>The Emperor looked at the looms, stared at the cloth and saw...nothing. He rubbed his eyes and looked again. Still nothing. His heart was beating. The colour had drained from his face. The cloth was invisible.</p>
<p>‘This is a disaster,’ he thought. ‘Everyone will know I’m a fool and unfit to be Emperor. I’m finished. I’ll have to resign, give up my Empire, admit I’m not up to the job’.</p>
<p>And then he thought. ‘No! I’m not going to allow this to happen. I am the Emperor and I’m going to carry on being the Emperor.’And so he said...</p>
<p>‘Magnificent! This is the most beautiful cloth I have ever seen.’ And of course his ministers and servants all agreed. None of them could really see any cloth either but nobody wanted to be thought a fool so they all said, ‘Magnificent...beautiful...quite, quite brilliant!’</p>
<p>And then someone started to clap. Others joined in...and soon the whole court was cheering the two strangers who smiled and bowed very low like actors on a stage.</p>
<p>When the cheering died down the Emperor asked the two strangers if they could make him a suit of clothes from the magic cloth. The tall stranger stroked his long chin and said, ‘Your Majesty, a suit of clothes made from this fine cloth will cost you two more bags of gold.’</p>
<p>‘Of course. Whatever. Pay them!’ ordered the Emperor. So the money was paid and the two cheats got to work.</p>
<p>Now different sounds came from the strangers’ room. Peering through the keyhole the Emperor could see scissors cutting invisible cloth and needles stitching with invisible thread. He longed to see his beautiful new clothes but the Emperor knew now that they would always remain invisible to him because he was a fool.</p>
<p>The cheating strangers worked through the night and in the morning they told the Emperor that his new clothes were ready. The Emperor was very excited and he announced that he would wear his new clothes that very morning and walk through his city so that his people could admire his latest outfit.</p>
<p>So the Emperor got undressed and the strangers helped him on with his new clothes. First they squeezed him into a pair of invisible trousers. ‘Trousers not too tight, Your Majesty?’ they asked.</p>
<p>‘No,’ said the Emperor. ‘Very comfortable. Very comfortable indeed actually.’ The strangers fastened invisible buttons and buckles, eased the Emperor into an invisible shirt and coat and placed an invisible hat on his head.</p>
<p>Finally, as they tied up the invisible laces on his invisible shoes, they said, ‘So how do the clothes feel, Your Majesty?’</p>
<p>‘Very light,’ said the Emperor. ‘It almost feels like I’m not wearing anything at all. Now fetch me a pair of gloves. I don’t want to get cold hands today.’ ‘Certainly,’ said the small round stranger. ‘What colour gloves shall I fetch?’</p>
<p>‘I don’t know,’ said the Emperor. ‘What do you think would be the best colour to go with this magnificent outfit?’ ‘Purple, I think, Your Majesty,’ said the tall thin stranger. ‘Yes. That’s what I think too,’ said the Emperor. ‘Fetch me some purple gloves andthen I’ll be ready.’</p>
<p>The city streets were full. A great crowd had come to see the Emperor’s new clothes. Everyone was excited, but they were also a bit scared. Everyone was thinking the same thought. ‘What if I can’t see the clothes? What if it turns out that I’m a fool?’</p>
<p>The Emperor led the procession out of the Palace and into the streets. He walked very slowly with his head in the air and a proud smile on his face and, although the people could see no clothes, they all clapped and praised the wonderful colours and the beautiful design. ‘Oh dear,’ thought the Emperor. ‘All my people can see my clothes. I must be the only fool in the whole city.’</p>
<p>And then a little boy pointed at the Emperor and said, ‘He’s got nothing on!’ Everything went quiet. The people looked at the little boy. The people looked at the Emperor.</p>
<p>‘Don’t be silly,’ said the boy’s father. ‘I’m sorry, Your Majesty. My son doesn’t know what he’s saying. He’s just a stupid boy. Your clothes are beautiful.’ ‘But he hasn’t got any clothes,’ said the little boy. ‘He’s all bare.’</p>
<p>‘No he’s not,’ said the boy’s father. ‘Yes he is,’ said the little boy. ‘He’s all bare. I can see...’ ‘Quiet!’ said the boy’s father.And now people started whispering amongst themselves.</p>
<p>‘The boy’s right,’ they said. ‘The Emperor’s got nothing on.’ The whispering spread and when people started pointing and laughing. ‘He’s all bare. He’s got nothing on.’</p>
<p>‘Poor fools,’ thought the Emperor. ‘Of course they can’t see my clothes. Just proves it. Fools every single one of them.’</p>
<p>And slowly, proudly he walked on through the city streets dressed in nothing but a pair of purple gloves.</p>
<h3 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h3>
<p>Sir Derek Jacobi reads an adaptation of 'The Emperor's new clothes' by Hans Christian Andersen.</p>
<p>A foolish emperor doesn't spend any time doing the things an emperor ought to do - he is only interested in trying on new clothes and parading them in front of his people.</p>
<p>One day two strangers arrive in town, offering the Emperor the chance to try some magical cloth which will be invisible to anyone who is a fool or not fit for their job. The Emperor orders some cloth to be prepared, paying two bags of gold for it. The Chief Minister and a servant cannot see the cloth, but neither wants to admit to this lest they be regarded as no good at their jobs. The Emperor thinks the same thing, and orders a suit of clothes to be made from the magical cloth, at the cost of more gold.</p>
<p>The cheating strangers help the Emperor into the imaginary clothes and he goes on a procession through the town. None of the townspeople wants to admit that they can’t see the clothes until a small boy pipes up that the Emperor has nothing on at all. This causes the rest of the crowd to start whispering and laughing as they realise the boy is right. The Emperor just carries on with his parade – thinking the people must all be fools.</p>
