the Paz family live in Mahwah a small
00:17
town in New Jersey about 45 minutes
00:19
northwest of New York City on the east
00:22
coast of the USA Gerry and Michelle have
00:26
four children three sons and one
00:29
daughter Amanda who is at high school is
00:33
their eldest child Gerald is 12 and
00:36
Jeremy is 7 their youngest son Julian is
00:40
4 years old the family have two guinea
00:44
pigs called Bart and spider pig the
00:48
family have lived in Mahwah for 14 years
00:51
before moving to their four-bedroom
00:53
house nine years ago they lived in an
00:56
apartment like many families in the
00:59
United States
00:59
Gerry and Michelle come from very
01:02
different cultural backgrounds Gerry's
01:05
parents Victor and Lola lived nearby my
01:09
name is Lola Pass
01:10
my name is Victor Pass we come from Lima
01:14
Peru Gerry was also born in Lima but in
01:17
1978 when he was 13 years old
01:20
his parents made the difficult decision
01:22
to move to the United States the family
01:27
had five children and hoped that there
01:30
were more jobs and opportunities in the
01:32
USA today Gerry works in a hospital I
01:38
work at the Valley Hospital is a
01:42
information systems technician I've been
01:46
working there for the past almost 7
01:49
years now and as being not only a pretty
01:54
much a rewarding job but also I have
01:56
learned a lot from from the business
02:02
point of view
02:06
Michele was born in the US but her birth
02:09
parents were from in the Philippines
02:12
she was adopted by an irish-american
02:14
family when she was just six days old
02:17
and she grew up in the New York area
02:20
well I was born in the now-closed st.
02:23
Vincent's Hospital in New York City in
02:26
the early 70s and I was given up for
02:29
adoption when I was six days old my
02:31
biological parents are Filipinos from
02:34
the Philippines and because I was born
02:38
in New York that makes me Filipino
02:39
American and my adoptive parents are
02:42
Irish American I think like my
02:44
great-grandparents came over from
02:46
Ireland and the grandparents and then my
02:49
parents would also were born here in New
02:51
York Michelle isn't working at the
02:55
moment she stays at home to look after
02:57
the kids I used to work outside the
03:00
house years ago I worked in the garment
03:03
district in New York for a women's
03:04
clothing retailer for about seven years
03:06
but the economy changed so I lost my job
03:10
so I've been home with the kids for the
03:13
last couple of years
03:16
[Music]
03:23
jerry and michelle met 20 years ago and
03:26
they have been married for 15 years they
03:31
met while they were working together in
03:32
a department store and I was still in
03:36
high school and I started talking to him
03:38
and just as a joke because again this is
03:41
I didn't know a lot about the
03:44
Philippines or its culture I just see
03:46
Jerry walking down the aisle and I said
03:48
excuse me excuse me are you Filipino and
03:51
he thought he said are you talking to me
03:53
and I said yeah yeah you come here come
03:54
here and I started talking to him I said
03:57
hi my name is Michelle was just curious
03:59
are you Philippine out and he says to me
04:01
yes and then he walks away so I go back
04:04
to folding my sweaters and doing my jobs
04:06
as a part-time salesperson he comes back
04:09
over and he says I'm sorry Michelle I
04:11
was only kidding I'm not Filipino I'm
04:13
like oh okay well where are you from
04:15
he said Kirill he started laughing we
04:18
started talking hanging out in 15 years
04:20
four kids later we're married and doing
04:24
the best we can and living our lives
04:26
the family is close-knit and Lola and
04:29
Victor play an important role in family
04:31
life they teach their children and
04:33
grandchildren about their Peruvian
04:35
cultural identity for Michelle it's more
04:38
difficult to pass on her Filipino
04:40
identity I'm glad that my in-laws are
04:43
involved in our lives and I can honestly
04:45
say that I'm very lucky for having such
04:48
wonderful open-minded welcoming people
04:50
in my family I'm still trying to learn
04:53
about the Philippines and its culture
04:56
because I know nothing of it so at this
04:59
point in time I can't really pass any
05:01
knowledge on to my children any kind of
05:03
cultural identity cultural customs
05:05
traditions have been passed down to the
05:08
children from the Peruvian side as my
05:11
children have their father you know my
05:13
husband's and their grandparents who are
05:15
still in touch with their culture to
05:17
teach them about the language the custom
05:19
whose the traditional dress the dances
05:22
we're still learning that my
05:24
mother-in-law she's an amazing proven
05:27
food cook
05:28
she's been feeding me basically since
05:30
Gerry walked in and introduced me to his
05:33
family so I've seen all different kinds
05:37
of cuisines and entrees from the
05:39
Peruvian side and a lot of the stuff is
05:42
delicious I've also learned how to cook
05:44
some of the things and which is also
05:46
made Gerry happy
05:49
[Music]
05:57
the Paz family are happiest when they
06:00
are together and Gerry cherishes his
06:02
time at home whenever I see him smiling
06:05
laughing having a good time and there
06:10
are quite a few times like I just can't
06:11
wait to get out of work be home with my
06:13
kids you know see them be with them be
06:16
with my wife and and uh see them happy
06:20
yeah but still sometimes life can be
06:24
difficult and there are many challenges
06:26
to overcome their oldest son
06:30
Gerald suffers from autism it's very
06:33
difficult for him to communicate with
06:34
other people and he needs special help
06:37
and support but the family not only
06:40
worked together to help Gerald overcome
06:42
his disability but they also help raise
06:44
money for research into autism some of
06:48
the things that make the family the
06:49
happiest are when we are doing
06:51
activities that are either helpful to
06:53
ourselves or helpful to others for
06:56
example we did in northern New Jersey
06:58
autism walk last weekend we were very
07:01
happy to walk as a team and help raise
07:05
money to fund autism research Gerry and
07:08
Michelle worried about the future for
07:09
all of their children I worry that
07:11
they'll be there will be appropriate
07:14
jobs for them after they finish college
07:16
or that I worry that they'll find the
07:19
right people and whether it's someone of
07:21
their own race and culture or just or
07:24
someone different I worry that they'll
07:26
be happy and not have to go through
07:28
personal pains and challenges but like
07:33
their parents before them they simply
07:35
want to do the best for their children
07:36
and hope that whatever happens their
07:39
children are happy
07:41
you
07:48
[Music]
07:59
it's the weekend in Cornwall in the
08:02
southwest of England the sun is shining
08:07
and people are enjoying their free time
08:10
at the seaside Cornwall is famous for
08:15
its stunning scenery pretty villages and
08:20
beautiful beaches and it's a popular
08:26
destination for people getting away from
08:28
stressful jobs and busy lives in towns
08:31
and cities and there's plenty to do with
08:36
your free time here for some people the
08:40
weekend is about the simple pleasures
08:42
and taking the time to relax at the
08:46
beach people take their dogs for walks
08:49
catch up with friends or spend time with
08:53
their families and for others it's all
08:55
about getting active during the working
08:58
week many people spend their time
09:01
sitting at a desk and the weekend is
09:03
their chance to get moving and keep fit
09:07
you can be a successful accountant
09:10
during the week and are passionate
09:12
surfer at the weekend all you need is a
09:15
wetsuit a board and perhaps a few
09:18
surfing lessons first the beaches are
09:23
full of enthusiastic sportsmen and women
09:26
all you need is a ball a bat and a group
09:30
of friends you can go for a swim or
09:32
perhaps explore the coastline by kayak
09:36
the more adventurous can even try to
09:39
catch some fish for dinner but while the
09:45
sea and coastline are beautiful they can
09:48
also be treacherous with strong currents
09:51
and unpredictable weather conditions
09:53
every year thousands of people get into
09:57
difficulty on the coast and it's not
09:59
just the holidaymakers who are at risk
10:02
for people like the commercial fishermen
10:05
who work along the coastline the sea is
10:08
a place of work and it's a dangerous
10:10
workplace fishermen work long hours and
10:16
are paid very little for doing the most
10:18
dangerous job in the UK they are 50
10:22
times more likely to die at work than
10:25
people with other jobs
10:31
[Music]
10:42
in the UK when something goes wrong at
10:46
sea or on the beach whether you are
10:48
working or just enjoying a day out
10:50
there's an amazing group of dedicated
10:53
people who give up their free time to
10:56
help the members of the Royal National
10:58
Lifeboat institution the RNLI the
11:01
charity that saves lives at sea the RNLI
11:09
was formed in 1824 to help anyone who
11:13
got into trouble in the seas around the
11:15
coastline of the United Kingdom the RNLI
11:18
has both lifeboat volunteers who respond
11:22
to emergency calls twenty-four hours a
11:24
day and lifeguards who patrol more than
11:27
a hundred and sixty beaches the charity
11:32
uses money donated by the public to pay
11:34
for its work for every 1 pound given to
11:39
the RNLI 81 pence is spent on providing
11:43
a rescue service while the rest is spent
11:46
on programs focused on preventing
11:48
accidents happening and raising more
11:50
money for the charity since it started
11:55
the are analyzed boats and lifeguards
11:57
have saved more than one hundred and
12:00
thirty-nine thousand lives today there
12:04
are over four and a half thousand
12:06
lifeboat crew and over 900 seasonal
12:10
lifeguards working for the organization
12:12
most of these people are volunteers who
12:15
give up their free time and put their
12:18
own lives in danger to prevent accidents
12:21
and rescue people in need for RNLI
12:26
lifeguards 95 percent of the job is to
12:29
prevent accidents before they happen at
12:32
the beach
12:37
they watch the sea carefully to check
12:40
that no one is getting into trouble they
12:45
have to be ready to rush to help
12:46
swimmers or surfers if they get into
12:48
difficulty lifeguards have to
12:54
concentrate hard and they only stay on
12:56
duty for short periods of time before
12:59
they have to take a break
13:02
lifeboat crew members attend emergencies
13:05
at sea and can be called at any time day
13:09
or night the crew members pager will go
13:14
off and they will rush down to the
13:16
lifeboat station and launch the lifeboat
13:22
they have to spend many hours of their
13:25
own time to become highly skilled and
13:28
efficient lifesavers so what kind of
13:47
people volunteer for the RNLI
13:51
[Music]

Robin hull is a senior lifeguard on
13:59
Perranporth beach in Cornwall it's 10
14:04
a.m. on a Sunday in June and Robin is
14:07
starting work he's setting up all his
14:10
equipment and getting ready for a day
14:12
keeping people safe on the beach people
14:15
are only allowed to swim between the red
14:17
and yellow flags as this is the area
14:20
that Robin is watching Robin has a radio
14:25
to stay in contact with the lifeguard
14:28
base my name is Robin how I am a
14:35
geography teacher at a secondary school
14:37
in Carmel
14:39
I have a second job which is senior
14:43
lifeguard on Perranporth Beach I work
14:46
all year round as a teacher as a teacher
14:51
I don't work at the weekends but from
14:53
March all the way through to September
14:55
I work as a lifeguard on Perranporth
14:58
Beach other weekends the lifeguard hours
15:03
are between 10:00 and 6:00 p.m. in the
15:06
evening
15:08
having two jobs doesn't leave much time
15:11
for relaxing and even when he's not
15:13
working
15:14
Robin likes to stay busy I think the
15:17
main problems with having two jobs it's
15:21
just literally trying to fit it in you
15:24
know in us in the space of a week but
15:27
I'd rather be busy than sitting at home
15:31
watching TV I mean in my free time I try
15:35
and do as much as possible there's not a
15:37
lot of free time but I'm doing a
15:39
master's in film and I tried to as much

them I love the life garden because it's
16:04
outside and it's very physical and I
16:07
love the teaching because I just like

16:13
difference to their education

18:03
William Shakespeare is internationally
18:06
recognized as one of the greatest
18:07
literary geniuses in history although he
18:11
died nearly 400 years ago his plays and
18:14
poetry are still studied by 50% of all
18:18
school students around the world both in
18:21
his native English and in translation
18:23
and his writing has shaped the English
18:26
language we know today but despite the
18:31
global recognition of his work very
18:34
little is known for certain about the
18:35
life of William Shakespeare most of the
18:39
information we have about Shakespeare's
18:41
life comes from his time living in the
18:43
small town of stratford-upon-avon in
18:45
England today Stratford as a town
18:49
dedicated to Shakespeare's life and work
18:51
it's home to Shakespeare's birthplace
18:53
and Museum and the Royal Shakespeare
18:56
Theatre visitors come here from all over
18:59
the world to learn more about
19:00
Shakespeare's life and to experience his
19:03
plays being performed live by some of
19:06
the best Shakespearean actors in the
19:07
world the Royal Shakespeare Company
19:13
so what do people think they know about
19:15
Shakespeare's life studied improved GCSE
19:19
yeah but apart from that you don't
19:22
really learn much about his life no you
19:23
don't about it like these work just like
19:25
Macbeth Romeo and Juliet King King there
19:29
but you don't really learn really about
19:32
him as a person he was born in
19:36
stratford-upon-avon I know that much
19:38
that's why we're here to have a look he
19:41
was a playwright wrote wrote loads of
19:43
plays and married Anne Hathaway did he
19:47
did he yeh did admit he was a playwright
19:51
and an actor and he's from
19:54
stratford-upon-avon and he moved to
19:56
London from a young age and there's a
19:59
few years of his life I believe where we
20:01
don't know what happened to him six or
20:02
seven years missing where we don't know
20:04
what he did or where he was well he was
20:06
born here in Stratford and he lived in
20:10
London for quite a long time where he
20:14
wrote plays and ran the company for The
20:18
Globe Theatre and we had twins can't
20:24
remember who was a married to Anne
20:26
Hathaway's cottage last year
20:31
[Music]
20:39
so what are the facts what do we
20:42
actually know about Shakespeare William
20:45
Shakespeare was born on the 23rd of
20:47
April 1564 in this house in
20:50
stratford-upon-avon his father John was
20:54
a successful glove maker and had a
20:56
workshop in the house
20:57
William was one of eight children four
21:00
boys and four girls he went to school in
21:04
Stratford but had left school by the age
21:06
of 16 at 18 William married the 26 year
21:11
old and Hathaway and they had three
21:14
children a daughter Susanna and twins
21:17
Hamnet and Judith Hamlet died when he
21:20
was just 11
21:22
we know that in 1592 Shakespeare was
21:26
living in London he was writing plays
21:28
and acting in theatres like the famous
21:31
Globe Theater but we don't know when he
21:34
left Stratford or how he became a
21:37
playwright at this time the theatre was
21:41
extremely important and by the time he
21:44
died in Stratford at the age of 52
21:46
Shakespeare was a successful and wealthy
21:48
man his 37 plays had been performed for
21:53
audiences from royalty to the poor in
21:55
theatres in London and around the
21:58
country
21:58
[Music]
22:00
the globe used to be one of the biggest
22:03
theaters in London and since its
22:05
restoration in 2000 orience is here have
22:08
been able to experience what going to
22:10
the theatre used to be like 400 years
22:13
ago it was a very different experience
22:18
as Jackie O Hanlon from the RSC explains
22:23
theatre in Shakespeare's time was an
22:26
incredibly popular form of entertainment
22:29
there wasn't anything else there was no
22:32
television everybody went to the theater
22:35
everybody the tickets were cheap all
22:39
kinds of society all kinds of people
22:41
would be in a theater together watching
22:45
the play the globe held an audience of
22:48
up to 3,000 they were really big events
22:53
and they were the kind of thing that you
22:57
would take an afternoon off work to go
22:58
to in Shakespeare's time the audience
23:01
misbehaved it shouted out it threw
23:04
things that the actors another
23:06
difference is that women did not perform
23:08
on stage when Shakespeare was writing
23:10
plays the other crucial difference about
23:14
theatre in Shakespeare's time was that
23:16
it happened during the day so evening
23:19
performances couldn't happen because it
23:22
was dark so a lot of her performances
23:25
happened in the daytime outside
23:31
[Music]
23:40
in 2011 the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in
23:45
Stratford was transformed to provide the
23:47
best possible venue for bringing
23:49
Shakespeare to a wider audience in this
23:52
new Royal Shakespeare Theatre everything
23:55
has brought much closer together
23:57
so the furthest seat from the stage is
24:01
15 metres away in the old theatre it was
24:04
24 metres really big difference we
24:08
wanted to create a sense that the
24:10
audience and the actors are in the same
24:13
room but we're sharing this story
24:16
together the Royal Shakespeare Company
24:21
also works hard outside of the theatre
24:23
to bring the work of Shakespeare to
24:25
modern audiences in new and unusual ways
24:31
last year we launched a Twitter play
24:34
called such tweets ro based around Romeo
24:38
and Juliet five actors played five key
24:42
characters from the play and tweeted
24:45
using a hundred and forty crack
24:47
characters over a five-week period their
24:51
journey through the play Romeo and
24:54
Juliet but in modern language it created
24:57
this enormous new audience for
25:00
Shakespeare and that's what we're trying
25:02
to do all of the time is surprise
25:05
audiences by Hugh Shakespeare is and
25:08
what he was writing about
25:11
but the genius of shakespeare is his use
25:14
of the English language and the stories
25:17
that he tells Shakespeare uses about
25:22
20,000 words throughout his 37 plays
25:27
that's not a huge number today but when
25:31
he was writing it was and it's possibly
25:35
not what the words are but it's how
25:37
creatively he uses those words that is
25:41
his genius it's the way he placed his
25:44
words next to each other that creates
25:46
their beauty and their very unique
25:49
meaning to us however while most people
25:54
have had to study Shakespeare at school
25:56
they rarely continue to read his work as
25:59
adults so what do we learn from his
26:03
stories and why are they so popular I
26:08
think what we learn from Shakespeare
26:13
whether we read the plays or perform the
26:15
plays or watch them as an audience
26:17
member is we learn about ourselves I
26:20
fundamentally believe that the reason
26:24
the plays have sustained have stayed
26:26
alive for 400 years is because they
26:30
speak about us they speak about the
26:35
world we live in each other these days
26:40
for many people seeing Shakespeare
26:42
performed the theater is reserved for a
26:45
special occasion people worry that they
26:47
can't understand Shakespeare but as
26:50
Jackie O Hanlon says this should not be
26:52
a barrier
26:53
I will first of all look at a
26:55
Shakespeare play and not immediately be
26:57
able to understand it so the first thing
27:00
is to accept that's normal and good and
27:04
we find this a lot with students that we
27:07
work with that have English as an
27:09
additional language that actually they
27:12
will make more progress with Shakespeare
27:15
than students who speak English as their
27:18
first language
27:19
because speakers of English as an
27:22
additional language
27:24
are used to learning new words all the
27:27
time and Shakespeare's just another
27:29
language to learn and even if people are
27:32
sometimes unsure about Shakespearean
27:34
language most people can remember at
27:37
least a few quotes although not always
27:40
correctly tomorrow and tomorrow and
27:43
tomorrow to be or not to be that is the
27:45
question whether tis nobler in mind to
27:46
suffer the slings and arrows no reason
27:49
not the need that's a good one when
27:50
you're shopping from King Lear
27:54
all's well that ends well how sharper
27:59
than a serpent's tooth it is to have a
28:00
thankless child my mother used to quote
28:03
that to me all the time I'm Charlie
28:06
thinking what I can't to be a lot to be
28:08
is the obvious one yeah a horse a horse
28:11
my kingdom for a horse shall I not
28:14
compare thee to a summers rose yeah
28:17
Oh the last I knew him so well yeah if
28:20
music be the food of love play on that's
28:22
a good one he's good on it's a very good
28:24
one
28:29
[Music]
28:42
when I grew up the world will seem to be
28:46
a much smaller place there were far
28:50
fewer choices for us to make my mother
28:55
was quite a strict person my father died
28:58
when I was quite young when I was six
29:01
and she had to work a lot so it was very
29:05
hard for her and I think that had an
29:08
effect on her there was no video games
29:14
hardly any electronic equipment in the
29:16
house at all entertainment was pretty
29:19
much what you made yourself television
29:21
was only on for a few hours a day in
29:23
children's television and he ran for an
29:27
hour or so in that in the afternoon but
29:29
a lot of the time I'd be out playing
29:31
with friends if the weather was good
29:33
because there's no way of communicating
29:34
with us so if for example say a mealtime
29:38
was set for half-past five you had to be
29:40
home for that time I don't think we are
29:48
a strict these days as they used to be I
29:51
have two of my own children a boy age 24
29:54
and a girl age 22 when they were growing
29:57
up I think life was different for them
30:02
we had a firm few rules certainly that
30:04
my wife enforced they weren't allowed
30:07
out as much as we were I used to be out
30:10
a lot during the day but my children had
30:13
to be home a lot more expectations with
30:15
say homework certainly my wife was far
30:19
stricter than my mother ever was in
30:20
making sure homework was done but they
30:22
have so much homework now when they're
30:24
young my children weren't allowed
30:27
televisions in their rooms until they
30:29
were old enough to buy their own we had
30:33
one television downstairs and for all
30:37
my wife made us all including me write
30:40
out lists of what we wanted to watch
30:42
during the week so you wrote down your
30:45
list and that's what you watched if it
30:47
wasn't on the list you didn't have it on
30:49
I don't think children have it easy
30:56
these days I think the pressure is on
30:59
them are different to my generation and
31:02
my mother's generation I think this
31:05
generation have a lot more choice than
31:07
our generation did when I was growing up
31:10
children are faced with many choices and
31:12
many pressures that I didn't face when I
31:15
was growing up I think there is a
31:17
problem that comes with choices because
31:20
it's easy to make the wrong choices when
31:23
you only have one choice to make it's
31:25
very hard to get it wrong
31:29
[Music]
31:40
when I was growing up at at school I
31:43
think the biggest thing I noticed was
31:45
that I didn't know anyone else who was
31:48
half a mixed race I'm half Thai and my
31:52
dad's from Thailand there wasn't as high
31:56
community in cheltenham and so I quite
32:01
liked being a bit different it helped me
32:04
sort of find my way
32:06
become an individual my mum's very
32:08
strong and independent and she came from
32:11
a very busy city and my dad is quite
32:15
he's he's very zen he's very calm and he
32:19
has some traditional ideas about
32:22
bringing up girls and things and um he
32:27
grew up in a rural area of Thailand well
32:36
when I was growing up I wasn't allowed
32:38
to go to the cinema if any boys were
32:42
going I wanted to get a part-time job
32:45
like a paper round or something but I
32:47
wasn't allowed I think I think but the
32:52
way my brothers were brought up was
32:53
different and I don't know if it was
32:55
because they're boys or whether I'm
32:59
because I'm the eldest and so they let
33:02
them go out a bit more sooner and not
33:08
they didn't worry about them as much I
33:12
think and you know Ben had a paper round
33:16
a couple of years ago and so yeah I
33:21
think they're much more lenient with
33:22
them which which really used to
33:24
frustrate me as well but I've kind of
33:26
come around to understanding why it was
33:28
that way I think
33:35
nowadays children are growing up a lot
33:38
more aware of other cultures there are
33:44
more children now who have them perhaps
33:47
a similar upbringing maybe just because
33:50
I think now that there are more
33:52
mixed-race children when I was growing
33:55
up there were separate communities and
33:58
so people are much becoming much more
34:00
intercultural and sort of understanding
34:02
a bit more of other other communities
34:06
and other cultures and things my name is
34:18
Miranda Miranda Wilson and I'm British I
34:22
come from the UK I'm in my early 50s
34:25
I've got two children
34:27
they're called Amy and me my name's Amy
34:31
I'm 21 years old and I'm at University
34:35
at music College studying opera I think
34:43
I'm a strict parent I think rules are
34:46
very important I I thought that my
34:50
children were quite adventurous and a
34:53
little bit on the wild side and
34:55
therefore rules are very important we
35:00
have especially our mealtime rules were
35:03
quite were quite interesting because
35:05
they got so badly behaved at mealtimes
35:08
that I really decided that we had to
35:12
have rules and I wrote I wrote them on a
35:14
piece of paper and put them on the wall
35:15
by the table so that when we sat down to
35:18
have our meals they could see the rules
35:20
written on the wall and that was quite
35:22
important and we had to sit at the table
35:25
we had to eat nicely and I had to have
35:31
good table manners I think the other
35:33
rule really important rule is bedtime
35:36
because what I've noticed is that as
35:39
soon as they don't have enough sleep
35:41
they behave badly so bedtime is very
35:45
important and making sure that they do
35:47
get to bed
35:48
on time and obviously get up on time
35:52
those were just two places where I
35:55
imposed strict rules and they seemed to
35:57
then create a certain amount of a
36:01
structure in the day I'm not necessarily
36:10
in control but I know everything that
36:14
they do so I know when they go out I
36:18
know where they're going I know what
36:20
time they're coming back I know what
36:22
their homework is I know when they've
36:24
got particular things to do and I know
36:27
for example whose turn it is to clear
36:30
the table so it's just sort of making
36:33
sure that they know that I know what
36:37
they should be doing and I think that
36:39
really makes a lot of difference and
36:41
that's how I interpret being strict I
36:49
think my mum was quite a strict parent
36:52
she was certainly strict about food no
36:56
sort of crisps and junk food and I
36:59
totally appreciate that now she had a
37:01
lot of rules about manners at the dinner
37:03
table eating using your knife and fork
37:07
properly and we had to say please may I
37:10
get down now when we'd finished dinner I
37:13
remember her getting us to help with a
37:17
lot of household chores and gardening
37:19
and not being one of those mums who just
37:23
does everything for us
37:24
I remember rules about bedtime were to
37:29
go when she said to go we had to do
37:32
reading before bed either we would read
37:35
to Mum or sometimes she would read to us
37:38
depending on how sleepy you were so she
37:40
was strict but I think in all the right
37:42
ways and she made us respect her when I
37:47
was younger I used to disagree with her
37:50
sometimes mainly to do with social
37:52
events and sort of hanging out with
37:55
friends or what I was going to do after
37:58
school because mum would try and
37:59
encourage me to not over
38:02
do things so that I wouldn't get tired
38:04
and also to do schoolwork and do
38:08
practice for my hobbies for example
38:11
singing practice or piano practice and
38:13
there were times when I didn't agree
38:15
with what she'd said and I rebelled she
38:19
let us make her own decisions but would
38:21
always say what she thought about them
38:24
so for example she'd say well you can go
38:27
to the disco if you want to but I think
38:31
you might be tired the next day or you
38:34
might not enjoy it as much as you think
38:36
but if you want to you can do what you
38:40
want so at times I did go against what
38:43
she said and sometimes those things were
38:46
okay and sometimes they didn't go as
38:48
well as I wanted and now I realized that
38:51
mum is normally 99.9% she's right
39:01
[Music]
39:12
throughout history mankind has always
39:15
been fascinated by space with the
39:19
development of new technology humans
39:22
have traveled further into space than
39:24
anyone predicted was possible just a
39:26
hundred years ago in the 1950s and 60s
39:31
enormous progress was made in space
39:34
exploration it reached its peak when
39:37
Neil Armstrong became the first human to
39:40
walk on the moon on July the 20th 1969
39:45
but this progress wasn't made just
39:48
because of developments in technology as
39:50
physicists are new Oh JA explains human
39:55
space exploration started in 1961 that
39:58
was half a century ago with Yuri Gagarin
40:01
being the first human being to orbit the
40:03
Earth now when we look back in time the
40:06
original reason for going into space was
40:09
this political battle this struggle
40:11
between the Soviet Union Russia nowadays
40:14
we think of it and the United States
40:16
communism against capitalism and that's
40:19
why humans went to the moon throughout
40:21
the 1970s and 80s the United States and
40:25
Russia continued to dominate space
40:27
exploration but in the past 20 years
40:30
things have started to change it's true
40:34
to say that in the early years of space
40:36
exploration it was individual countries
40:38
competing against each other
40:40
we had the United States against the
40:42
Soviet Union but in the last 20 years
40:45
we're seeing more and more international
40:47
cooperation and the greatest example of
40:50
this cooperation is the International
40:52
Space Station which has been in orbit
40:55
since the late 1990s
40:58
the International Space Station is a
41:00
collaboration between the Russians the
41:03
Americans the Europeans the Japanese the
41:07
Brazilians and many other countries and
41:10
while countries like the United States
41:13
are reducing their investment in space
41:16
other countries are just starting to get
41:18
involved when it comes down to space
41:21
exploration space science space
41:23
technology a lot of people have this
41:25
idea that it's just NASA or it's just
41:28
the European Space Agency or it's just
41:30
the Russians what we found in the last
41:32
10 to 15 years is some of the countries
41:35
that are emerging financially are also
41:38
starting to play a bigger and bigger
41:40
role in space the Chinese launched their
41:43
own astronauts on their own rocket in
41:45
their own spaceship in 2003 I expect
41:49
that we'll see India launching its own
41:51
astronauts in its own spacecraft in the
41:54
next few years and space truly now it's
41:57
an international collaboration
42:02
[Music]
42:10
in the future it could become
42:13
increasingly difficult for many
42:15
countries to justify spending on space
42:18
programs when people ask for questions
42:20
why do we spend all our money on space
42:23
science and space technology what
42:26
difference does it make to our everyday
42:28
lives to understand why space programs
42:32
are so necessary we need to ask
42:34
ourselves what would happen if we didn't
42:36
have any of this space technology the
42:39
best way of trying to understand just
42:41
how much we get from space science and
42:44
space satellites is to imagine what
42:47
would happen right now in the 21st
42:50
century if we switched off all the
42:52
satellites orbiting the Earth what
42:54
effect would it have on our lives
42:56
no GPS systems no Sat Navs in cars
43:01
global telecommunications getting
43:04
signals getting news getting sports
43:06
coverage global communications all of it
43:09
would completely stop within one or two
43:12
days and the way we live our lives is so
43:16
dependent on this that life will get
43:18
pretty uncomfortable even in the space
43:21
of just a week we need satellites to
43:24
maintain the way we live our lives in
43:26
this century space technology also plays
43:29
a vital role in monitoring the weather
43:31
and environmental change every year
43:36
thousands of lives are saved by the
43:38
information coming from weather
43:39
satellites and if we want to understand
43:42
what humans are doing to the environment
43:43
there are lots of concerns about climate
43:46
change is climate change real yes how
43:50
much of it is being caused by humans
43:51
that's what we're still not sure about
43:54
but in the last 10 years we've got a
43:56
network of satellites that are what we
43:58
call earth observers they're looking
44:00
down at the planet they're helping us
44:02
understand the planet better
44:06
increasingly traveling into space has
44:09
less to do with human exploration and
44:12
much more to do with big business
44:15
unmanned spacecraft are being used to
44:19
launch commercial satellites and the
44:21
space enthusiasts like our new this is a
44:24
concern in my opinion there is a
44:30
difference between space science and
44:32
space applications from satellites and
44:35
human space exploration humans have been
44:40
into space since 1961 but only 500
44:44
people have gone in the last
44:46
half-century and of those 500 people
44:48
only 24 went to another world
44:52
those were the Apollo astronauts that
44:53
went to the moon between 1968 and 1972
44:57
and twelve of them walked on the moon
45:00
when we think of how long ago that was
45:03
there is a lot of concern about why do
45:06
we do human spaceflight why do we
45:09
explore now in my mind being an explorer
45:13
wanting to know what over the horizon is
45:16
part of what it is to be human when I
45:19
was a child growing up it was human
45:21
space exploration that made me want to
45:24
be a physicist than a scientist and that
45:28
is what led me to the job I have now but
45:30
for the last 40 years we've just been
45:34
going around the earth
45:35
[Music]
45:49
so what's next were the people who still
45:52
dream that one day they will be able to
45:54
see the Earth from space for the people
45:57
who hope that one day they might be able
45:59
to set foot on the moon
46:00
or even visit another planet for many
46:06
years some people have believed that the
46:09
age of mass space tourism is on the
46:11
horizon but over ten years since the
46:15
world's first orbital space tourists
46:17
Dennis Tito paid around 20 million
46:20
dollars to spend six days on the
46:22
International Space Station the
46:25
development of this industry has been
46:27
slower than predicted and our new is a
46:30
realist about the future when it comes
46:33
down to space tourism the idea of
46:36
thousands of people taking holidays in
46:38
space will be as much a fantasy in 50
46:42
years time as it is today the challenges
46:46
of human space exploration and staying
46:49
in space are still extreme
46:53
companies like Virgin Galactic are
46:55
already selling trips into space on
46:58
their own spaceships
47:00
[Music]
47:02
[Applause]
47:06
Virgen are currently building a
47:08
spaceport in the desert of New Mexico in
47:10
the USA a ticket will cost about two
47:16
hundred thousand pounds but the whole
47:18
trip will take less than four hours and
47:21
passengers will experience zero gravity
47:23
for just a few minutes if you want to be
47:35
an astronaut the official definition is
47:38
that you must go above 100 kilometers
47:41
altitude if you go higher than that you
47:44
are one of the 500 people that have ever
47:47
been astronauts and what they're
47:49
developing are spacecraft that will not
47:52
go fast enough to go around the planet
47:55
but will just go up and down and the
47:58
people paying hundreds of thousands of
48:01
dollars or hundreds of thousands of
48:02
euros will have a fantastic experience
48:05
they will feel the thrust of a rocket
48:08
ride into space they will get an
48:11
experience of floating and they'll see
48:14
the beautiful curvature of the earth
48:17
from space and they'll see the blackness
48:19
of space but they'll only see it for a
48:21
few minutes before they fall back down
48:24
to the surface
48:26
for some people this might be enough
48:28
after all they will be able to say that
48:31
they are an astronaut but for others
48:34
this simply won't be worth the enormous
48:36
cost and the very real risks there is a
48:40
very good reason why since 1961 only 500
48:45
people out of the billions of people of
48:47
life have ever been into space and it's
48:50
to do with the enormous amounts of
48:52
energy we need and the enormous limits
48:55
of science and engineering that we have
48:58
to try and face now rocket science and
49:01
rocket engineering it's safe
49:04
but even though 500 people have been
49:07
into space 18 have died in the process
49:10
human spaceflight is not a hundred
49:13
percent safe it's a risky business and
49:15
so whenever human beings want to explore
49:18
and they want to go further there is
49:20
always a risk factor I think for the
49:24
foreseeable future
49:26
human spaceflight is going to be about
49:29
going around the earth is going to be
49:32
about doing experiments that we can't do
49:34
on earth and it's going to have some
49:37
fantastic discoveries that are made but
49:40
for me that is not what space
49:42
exploration is while space tourism is an
49:46
idea that I think would be fantastic and
49:49
I would love to experience I don't think
49:52
we're going to see a time in the next
49:55
century when we have thousands and
49:57
thousands of tourists taking holidays in
50:00
space I think that's more science
50:02
fiction than science fact
50:05
you
50:12
[Music]
50:25
it would be this hat because this is my
50:28
father's hat see suede hat feels like
50:32
very very good material it had it's
50:34
brown with a black band around it and a
50:39
feather now the funny thing is that the
50:41
Hat doesn't fit me okay so I really
50:44
can't wear it anywhere what it means for
50:46
me today is mainly luck I kind of keep
50:50
it for luck my most treasured possession
50:57
is my album
50:58
London Calling by the clash
51:02
it's a vinyl a vinyl record it was a
51:05
double album made in 1979 on the front
51:09
cover we have a photograph of the bass
51:13
player Paul Simonon and it was taken by
51:16
penny Smith on the bank we have the full
51:19
track listing as well and more
51:22
photographs of the band and I think this
51:25
is the greatest rock photograph ever
51:28
taken and certainly the best album cover
51:30
of all the time I came by this album by
51:33
by accident actually I was in a record
51:35
shop and I was just looking through lots
51:38
of Records and this album just caught my
51:41
eye
51:41
and I picked it up and I liked the cover
51:44
I took it home listened to it and I fell
51:47
in love with it from that moment I
51:49
haven't stopped listening to it since
51:50
then and that was 20 years ago
51:52
unfortunately I don't play this anymore
51:54
on the record play this record lives on
51:57
my desk to look at but I do own this on
52:02
CD and as a digital download as well I
52:06
still listen to the music I've been
52:08
listening to this music for over 20
52:10
years now but I keep the record as a
52:13
memento of my discovery of discovering
52:17
music
52:21
if my house was on fire and I could only
52:24
save one possession it would be my cell
52:26
phone this cell phone that I have now I
52:29
got I think on my 16th or 17th birthday
52:34
I used my cell phone a lot I do it for
52:37
everything when I'm driving I use it for
52:39
GPS text emails internet on the screen I
52:45
have a mirror so that when the screen
52:48
isn't lit up I can just like look at
52:49
myself and make sure that I look okay
52:51
and it's really good for like putting
52:52
lipstick on and stuff the screen itself
52:56
is cracked because I've dropped it a few
52:58
times but I'd say for having it for a
53:01
year and a half to two years it's in
53:03
pretty good shape
53:05
I've lost my phone a few times some
53:10
definitely emotionally attached to my
53:12
cell phone it's like my best friend
53:16
[Music]
53:27
well my most treasured possession is my
53:29
motto from Argentina it was given to me
53:33
by work friends as a birthday present a
53:36
few years ago when I was working in
53:37
Argentina it's something which is very
53:40
common over there and it's used for
53:43
drinking a kind of South American tea so
53:47
you put the the tea inside there's a
53:49
little bit of it there and you pour in
53:53
hot water and then you use the metal
53:56
straw which is the bond be sure to drink
54:00
the tea like that this one is quite
54:03
plain but it's covered in leather on the
54:06
outside and you can see it's stitched
54:08
there and it's got a little stand so you
54:11
can stand it up it's got a metal ring
54:13
around the top the straw the bong beitia
54:16
is just made from metal and it's it's
54:21
not very heavy it's probably about the
54:24
size of a tennis ball I would say and
54:26
it's it's it's very nice to hold in fact
54:29
it fits perfectly into into the hand now
54:34
it sits on my desk in my office and my
54:39
work colleagues in this country think
54:41
it's rather strange because they've
54:43
never seen one before so people come up
54:46
to me and they say what's that strange
54:47
thing on your desk it brings back
54:50
memories of Argentina it's something
54:54
that I like to have with me to remind me
54:57
of my of my time there
55:04
my most treasured possession is my
55:06
charango which is a kind of small guitar
55:11
comes from South America and I bought
55:14
this one in Ecuador about 15 years ago
55:18
and it cost about 50 US dollars it's
55:23
made it's made of wood it's probably
55:28
heavier than it looks and it has strings
55:32
that are just like guitar strings really
55:35
like classical guitar strings but it's
55:37
shorter I think it's incredible how much
55:41
sound it makes them it's really loud
55:43
sound for something so small and it's
55:46
also a sound that instantly transports
55:48
me back to to that part of the world to
55:51
Ecuador to Bolivia to Peru where you
55:54
hear the music that come that's played
55:56
with the tango quite a lot
56:01
I promised myself I'm going to learn to
56:05
play it properly but really I just know
56:08
one or two chords but it's so to say it
56:11
sounds so nice just playing a few chords
56:13
that I'm kind of happy
56:16
[Music]
56:30
if my home was on fire and I had to grab
56:34
something it would be my crystal jewelry
56:38
box the history of the jewelry box is
56:41
that my grandmother always had this on
56:43
her dresser with her perfume bottles
56:45
my grandmother's her prized possessions
56:48
you know we're always in here this
56:51
jewelry box means so much to me because
56:54
I really loved my grandmother I know
56:57
it's an object and most objects can be
57:00
replaced you can't replace this this
57:03
this is my life this is my mom's life
57:05
this is my grandmother's life and it's
57:08
just something that I treasure if my
57:17
house was on fire and I could only say
57:19
one thing it would be the package of
57:22
letters that me and my brother exchanged
57:25
these letters were actually an exchange
57:28
between him and me
57:30
maybe about four or five years ago and
57:34
we wrote them back and forth to each
57:36
other when he was in Texas and I was in
57:38
Chicago and we were both living on our
57:40
own and I've just kept them in this
57:43
manila folder and it's coming apart this
57:47
is actually an envelope that he used to
57:51
send me some of his drawings and so I've
57:54
saved them for this long and I don't
57:56
think it's been that long but um I've
57:58
traveled with them everywhere and I
58:00
haven't read them all the time but just
58:02
having them with me is is comforting
58:05
we've we've developed a relationship
58:08
through writing each other whether it's
58:10
been on letters through letters or
58:13
whether it's been on email and so just
58:16
the exchange of our experiences and our
58:19
stories helps to give us a better sense
58:23
of where we come from and what we're
58:24
going through and to also help you know
58:27
inspire and motivate each other as well
58:29
well it's time for me to end this letter
58:32
I hope you enjoyed it you're always in
58:34
my thoughts and in my heart I love you
58:36
more than words take care of big sis I
58:38
miss you so much
58:39
back your brother Akram
58:49
[Music]
59:00
since 1876 there has been an American
59:04
national baseball league but no one is
59:07
quite sure when or where the game of
59:09
baseball began
59:10
[Music]
59:13
there have been many different stories
59:15
told about the games origins over the
59:17
years in the early 18th century a game
59:20
called baseball was played in England
59:22
and many people have suggested that the
59:25
games of baseball and cricket have very
59:27
similar origins
59:29
but what is certain is that today
59:31
baseball is thought of as an American
59:34
sport
59:35
it's the national sport of the United
59:38
States that's played and watched by
59:39
millions of fans across the USA every
59:42
year even Americans who've never played
59:46
the game will often wear baseball caps
59:48
it's almost a national costume and real
59:52
baseball fans are passionate about their
59:55
sport for some people
59:58
baseball becomes their life author Vince
60:01
Gennaro writes about baseball and as a
60:03
lifelong fan I was introduced to
60:06
baseball at a very young age my
60:08
grandfather and my father were both big
60:11
baseball fans May 17 1957 at 5 years old
60:15
I went to my first baseball game at
60:17
Yankee Stadium and I can remember the
60:20
sights of seeing the green grass because
60:23
of course back then we were looking at
60:24
black-and-white television so to see the
60:27
colors in the green grass and the smells
60:29
of the hotdogs in the popcorn and just
60:32
was captivating
60:35
and if you go to nearly any park in the
60:37
US you are sure to see the game being
60:40
played by people of all ages old and
60:42
young in many parks there were baseball
60:47
diamonds where fans can practice
60:49
pitching catching and batting safely and
60:53
amateur leagues can play like football
60:58
all you really need is an open space and
61:01
a few people who want to play add the
61:03
bat and the ball and the game is on what
61:20
is it that makes baseball such a popular
61:22
sport in the u.s. by the time most
61:28
American children start school they've
61:31
already learned how to catch a baseball
61:32
and many play the sports through
61:34
elementary school high school and into
61:37
their college years
61:42
baseball is a competitive game for even
61:45
the youngest players some high school
61:48
games are covered by local media and
61:50
watched by professional teams looking
61:53
for new talent often major league teams
61:56
snap up the gifted young players before
61:59
they even reach college
62:03
sixteen year old Mike plays for his high
62:05
school team the Blue Devils and hopes to
62:08
continue playing as he enters college I
62:11
started playing baseball when I was
62:13
three or four years old and now I'm 16
62:17
and I'm I'm the backup to the second
62:19
baseman countless teenagers like Mike
62:22
have dreamed about becoming professional
62:24
baseball players ever since they first
62:26
picked up a bat and there are great
62:28
rewards for the best players much like
62:32
the world's best footballers baseball
62:34
superstars are getting higher and higher
62:36
salaries baseball players can make as
62:39
much as twenty five to thirty million
62:42
dollars for one season
62:44
now that's rare and reserved for the top
62:46
stars but that's the kind of dollars
62:48
that we see but baseball is most popular
62:52
as a spectator sport with hundreds of
62:54
thousands of fans regularly going to
62:57
stadiums to support their favorite teams
62:59
Vince explains what makes the game so
63:01
attractive to him as a spectator it's a
63:05
game that's passed down from mothers and
63:07
fathers to sons and daughters it's a way
63:10
to share a weekend afternoon in the
63:12
summer it really gives a family an
63:15
opportunity to be part of something and
63:17
share something together and that's one
63:19
of the things I love about baseball
63:23
watching the crowds arriving for a major
63:26
league game it's easy to see what Vince
63:28
means going to a baseball game is a
63:30
great day out for families and it's as
63:33
much about the socializing the food and
63:36
the merchandise as it is about the sport
63:38
for many fans you don't even have to
63:42
leave your seat to get food in many
63:43
stadiums of course it's a game for
63:47
serious sports fans too in baseball in
63:51
America today there are 30 major league
63:53
baseball teams and and these teams like
63:56
the New York Yankees or the Boston Red
63:58
Sox or the Chicago Cubs or the Los
64:00
Angeles Dodgers very much are linked to
64:03
the identity of their city and baseball
64:06
is a complex sport of scores statistics
64:09
and team rivalries
64:10
where fans record every hit and run and
64:12
follow their home teams with passion
64:15
[Applause]
64:19
[Music]
64:28
despite all the attractions of baseball
64:30
the sport hasn't become a global passion
64:33
in the same way that football has it
64:36
isn't even an Olympic sport anymore but
64:40
baseball has been working hard to change
64:41
this an interest has been growing around
64:44
the world
64:48
some of the areas around the globe where
64:50
baseball has caught on and is popular
64:53
include the Pacific Rim Japan Korea
64:57
Taiwan has become popular Japan is a
65:01
baseball mad country and many of the
65:05
stars of the game are Japanese stars one
65:09
of the early stars of Japan was Sadaharu
65:12
OH who became the all-time home run
65:14
leader in baseball in the more
65:17
contemporary times we have players like
65:19
Ichiro Suzuki and Daisuke Matsuzaka who
65:23
have come to this country and taken
65:25
their stardom from Japan and
65:27
transplanted it into the Major League
65:29
Baseball and have done exceedingly well
65:31
particularly Ichiro as a star for the
65:34
Seattle Mariners Latin America has
65:37
produced more modern baseball superstars
65:39
than anywhere outside the US but most of
65:43
them have been lost to the rich American
65:45
clubs what we're seeing are are as much
65:49
as one-third of all minor league
65:51
baseball players are from two countries
65:54
the Dominican Republic in Venezuela the
65:57
New York Yankees superstar Alex
65:59
Rodriguez the highest-paid player in the
66:01
major league comes from a Dominican
66:04
family in many ways countries like a
66:09
country like the Dominican Republic
66:11
where the standard of living is not that
66:12
high baseball has provided an outlet for
66:16
young men to leave the island and make a
66:19
career for themselves and oftentimes a
66:22
high earning career if they are
66:24
successful in Major League Baseball and
66:26
so that's one of the reasons why it's so
66:28
popular among the youth of the Dominican
66:31
Republic but what about the rest of the
66:34
world we have begun to see development
66:39
in Europe the Netherlands is actually is
66:41
one of the areas in within Europe where
66:44
where there is a serious baseball
66:46
interest in fact some major league
66:48
baseball players have come from the
66:50
Netherlands so have people started to
66:52
think about baseball as a global game
66:54
yet
66:55
not really but there is progress the
66:59
globalization of the game its popularity
67:02
in the Pacific Rim its popularity in
67:04
Latin America Australia and other parts
67:07
of the globe and its growing popularity
67:09
start to mean that this is more than an
67:12
American game
67:13
[Applause]
67:20
[Music]
67:31
Peru is one of the most beautiful and
67:35
fascinating countries in the world so
67:38
it's not a surprise that the country is
67:40
a dream destination for many travelers
67:42
young and old the country of around 30
67:46
million people is located on the Pacific
67:48
coast of South America and has borders
67:51
with five other countries Ecuador
67:54
Colombia Brazil Bolivia and Chile the
68:00
country has something to offer everyone
68:02
who visits for eco-tourists Peru's
68:07
natural scenery is as varied as it is
68:10
beautiful without leaving the country
68:14
you can travel from the beach to the
68:17
desert and from the soaring Andes
68:21
Mountains to the depths of the Amazonian
68:24
rainforest
68:25
[Music]
68:27
you can experience trekking through the
68:30
wilderness and encountering stunning
68:33
wildlife and it's not just the natural
68:40
environment that is extraordinary in
68:42
Peru cultural tourists will enjoy the
68:47
vibrant modern cities like Lima in old
68:53
cities like Cusco you can learn more
68:56
about the ancient Inca culture of Peru
68:58
in fascinating museums and palaces and
69:07
there's the chance to buy Peruvian
69:09
handicrafts and art at one of the many
69:12
markets and in isolated areas of the
69:19
country there are some of the most
69:21
astonishing man-made sites in the world
69:24
ancient and mysterious Inca settlements
69:30
and the amazing floating homes on lake
69:34
titicaca but there's one place in peru
69:38
that has become the ultimate destination
69:40
for adventurous travelers from around
69:42
the world it's a place that has been
69:45
voted one of the seven wonders of the
69:47
modern world and is an iconic symbol of
69:50
Peru with nearly a million visitors
69:52
every year
69:54
it's Matthieu Picchu the lost city of
69:58
the Incas
70:03
Machu Picchu is located at 2,000 430
70:08
meters above sea level in the mountains
70:11
about 80 kilometers from the ancient
70:14
Inca capital of Cusco
70:17
in July 2011 Machu Picchu celebrated the
70:22
100th anniversary of its rediscovery by
70:25
an American Explorer called Hiram
70:28
Bingham who worked at Yale University
70:31
while binghams discovery brought the
70:34
hidden sight to the attention of the
70:36
world the mysterious origins of Machu
70:39
Picchu stretch much further back into
70:42
history
70:45
[Music]
70:55
Explorer and writer Hugh Thompson has
70:58
spent a lot of time in Peru exploring
71:01
the Machu Picchu area I first went to
71:05
Peru almost 30 years ago and I went
71:08
because someone told me that there was a
71:10
ruin near Machu Picchu which had been
71:12
found once and then lost and it was such
71:17
a strange story this idea of a mislaid
71:19
ruin that I thought I'd go and try and
71:22
find it again with a group of friends so
71:24
I went off on my first expedition I
71:29
think one of the most extraordinary
71:30
things about Machu Picchu which is the
71:32
greatest of all the Inca sites or ruins
71:35
is that we have only known about it for
71:38
a hundred years which seems
71:41
extraordinary if you think how important
71:43
it is if you compare that to the
71:46
pyramids in Egypt or the other great
71:48
ruins of the ancient world it's
71:51
incredible that matcha Picchu should
71:53
have been lost so to speak for so long
71:57
Machu Picchu was described by Hiram
72:00
Bingham as the lost city of the Incas
72:03
and we still know very little about this
72:07
amazing place we don't know exactly when
72:11
Machu Picchu was built because of course
72:13
there's no written record but we think
72:15
around 1450 to 1470 some 50 years or so
72:21
before the Spanish arrived in 1532 and
72:25
then there's no record at all of Machu
72:28
Picchu until 1911 when the American
72:32
explorer Aharon Bingham discovered it so
72:35
what exactly was Matthieu Picchu was it
72:39
really a city built in the mountains we
72:43
think that mattre Picchu was built as a
72:46
winter estate for the Inca Emperor
72:49
Pachacuti and his court so that they
72:52
could escape from the winter cold of
72:55
Cusco their capital which is much higher
72:57
than that Shi Picchu and come down to
72:59
the warmer climate for a few months in
73:02
winter
73:03
seeing the ruin today it's almost
73:06
impossible to imagine how it was lost
73:08
for hundreds of years but there's an
73:11
unusual explanation so with Machu Picchu
73:16
we think that when the emperor who built
73:18
it
73:18
Pacha Kuti died it was then owned so to
73:23
speak by his mummified body and the next
73:28
Emperor had to build a different palace
73:30
somewhere else so much of Picchu was
73:33
forgotten if you like and lost so how
73:36
did Hiram Bingham rediscover Machu
73:38
Picchu Haran Bingham was not an
73:42
archeologist himself his great
73:45
speciality was Spanish he spoke Spanish
73:48
well and he used his knowledge of
73:51
Peruvian books and Peruvian histories to
73:55
give him clues as to where he might find
73:57
in Koreans he started off down this
74:01
Valley from Cusco down a road that had
74:04
only just been opened so most people
74:06
hadn't traveled that way before and he
74:09
was very lucky he was lucky because he
74:13
bumped into a local farmer who said if
74:16
you go up that hill señor you will see
74:20
some very interesting ruins in this case
74:23
it was a very steep hill that Bingham
74:25
had to climb with the farmer to have a
74:26
look none of the rest of his expedition
74:29
believed the farmer or went with him so
74:31
Bingham went up on his own and
74:33
discovered Machu Picchu Bingham returned
74:36
to the site the following year he
74:39
explored the area and took many
74:42
photographs that were published in
74:44
newspapers and magazines around the
74:46
world ham Bingham wrote a great deal
74:49
about Machu Picchu but his most famous
74:51
book is called lost city of the Incas
74:54
and it's probably the one most people
74:56
have heard of and that phrase has almost
74:59
entered the language and he used the
75:02
book to paint a very romantic picture of
75:06
Machu Picchu and maybe that's why so
75:09
many people still want to go there today
75:12
[Music]
75:19
for many tourists today the journey to
75:23
Machu Picchu is almost as important as
75:26
being at the palace if you want to visit
75:31
match you feature today you can either
75:33
go the easy way which is to take a train
75:35
and then a bus up to the ruins or you
75:37
can do what the Incas themselves would
75:39
have done which is to take the Inca
75:40
Trail the Inca Trail is a route the
75:44
Incas built themselves to travel from
75:47
Cusco to Machu Picchu the amazing
75:52
high-altitude track takes four or five
75:55
days for the modern visitor to walk
75:58
walkers need to prepare well for the
76:01
journey or they can get into trouble
76:04
because they are walking through forests
76:07
and along narrow paths at high altitudes
76:10
the Inca Trail is not for the
76:13
faint-hearted or unfit and walkers need
76:16
to plan their journey well in advance
76:19
the Peruvian authorities have restricted
76:22
numbers on the Inca Trail to conserve it
76:24
so only about 500 people a day are
76:27
allowed to be on the trail
76:30
it is a difficult route you have to
76:34
cross mountain passes of over 15,000
76:37
feet so many suffer from altitude
76:39
sickness and it's physically extremely
76:42
demanding there's a great deal of up and
76:44
down so what advice would you give
76:46
walkers the advice I'd give anyone who's
76:50
considering walking the Inca Trail is
76:52
that obviously you need to be fit it's a
76:54
tough route but also you need to
76:57
acclimatize to the altitude you need to
77:00
get used to the altitude for quite a few
77:02
days
77:02
before you begin the trail itself the
77:06
good news about doing the Inca Trail is
77:08
that you usually have porters who are
77:10
carrying all the heavy stuff for you so
77:13
that you yourself might just be carrying
77:15
a small daypack and you'll have a camp
77:20
in the evening it's often very
77:21
comfortable and often very very good
77:23
food while Machu Picchu is
77:26
an amazing place to visit the Peruvians
77:29
it is much more than a tourist
77:31
attraction it's an icon a symbol of
77:34
their national identity and provides a
77:37
very clear link to their incredible in
77:40
Karadzic I think one of the reasons that
77:43
so many people want to visit Machu
77:45
Picchu I mean along of the pyramids it's
77:47
one of those must-see destinations is
77:49
that matcha Picchu you feel when you go
77:54
there that you're touching a completely
77:57
different culture a different way of
77:59
thinking a different way of life one
78:01
that's still quite mysterious of course
78:04
and one that we don't fully understand
78:15
[Music]
78:26
we all like to think that we have a
78:28
social conscience we want to do the
78:31
right thing and we believe that if we
78:33
could we would try to help people who
78:36
are less fortunate than ourselves but
78:39
it's still inspiring to see other people
78:42
putting these thoughts into action when
78:46
Bill Gates started his computer company
78:48
Microsoft in 1975 he couldn't have
78:52
guessed that fewer than 25 years later
78:54
he would have become the richest man in
78:56
the world Gates made billions of dollars
79:00
at Microsoft and in 1994 he and his wife
79:04
Melinda started using their wealth to
79:07
help others in 1999 they started the
79:12
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and
79:15
with the help of other rich individuals
79:17
like Warren Buffett they began making a
79:20
real difference to the lives of people
79:22
around the world
79:25
in 2008 Bill Gates started working
79:29
full-time at the foundation by 2010 the
79:34
foundation had given over 24 billion
79:37
dollars to programs around the world
79:39
with work focusing on global development
79:42
and health care
79:43
[Music]
79:46
much of this work focused on preventable
79:49
diseases that affect the developing
79:51
world
79:55
2/3 of deaths in children under 5 in
79:58
developing countries are due to diseases
80:01
that can be prevented such as malaria
80:06
malaria is spread by the bite of a
80:09
mosquito and it causes nearly 1 million
80:11
deaths every year 95% of these deaths
80:17
are in Africa and 85% of those who die
80:21
are under 5 years of age but you don't
80:27
need to be wealthy to make a difference
80:29
to people's lives the day-to-day work of
80:34
an individual can be just as important
80:37
as the huge resources of a billionaires
80:39
foundation vaccines sometimes you just
80:45
need to have the time and the desire to
80:47
help make a real difference this is Pam
80:52
Llewellyn a nurse from a small town
80:55
called Upton in England when Pam retired
80:58
at the age of 59 she knew that she
81:01
wasn't ready to simply stop helping
81:03
people and just a year later she was
81:05
living in a remote rural town in Uganda
81:08
in East Africa using her experience as a
81:11
nurse and working as a member of an
81:13
organization called voluntary service
81:16
overseas or v/s Oh
81:19
[Music]
81:21
so were her family surprised at her
81:24
decision to give up her comfortable life
81:26
in England to go and work in Africa I
81:29
don't think they were surprised really
81:31
they know that joining my life had done
81:36
slightly different things I retired at
81:39
59 knowing that I wanted to do something
81:42
different and exciting and that was the
81:46
beginning of my VSO journey and the
81:49
beginning of my first of a visit to
81:52
Africa and my beginning of understanding
81:55
diseases like malaria VSO is an
82:12
international organization that works
82:14
through volunteers to fight poverty and
82:16
disease around the world over a period
82:20
of years I'd heard a couple of
82:22
interviews about people that had gone to
82:26
Russia Southeast Asia Africa and I
82:30
always thought I'd like to do that one
82:33
day and coming up to retirement I
82:37
thought I'm going to fill in the form
82:40
and see what happens
82:41
VSO sent Pam to the district of Maria in
82:44
the northwest of Uganda in this remote
82:48
rural area many people live in poverty a
82:51
lot of villages haven't got running
82:53
water and people have to get their water
82:55
from a pump life expectancy in Uganda is
82:59
only 45 Pam worked with a team of local
83:06
community volunteers who traveled around
83:08
the district giving families mosquito
83:10
nets and talking to them about malaria
83:13
prevention as well as other health
83:15
issues I was lucky because when I
83:21
arrived in Uganda BSO gave me medication
83:27
and that was a tablet every day of my
83:30
stage during my two years so I took the
83:33
tablet I never forgot and I never got
83:36
malaria they also gave me a treated
83:41
mosquito net which I used every night of
83:45
my stay there if Pam hadn't taken
83:50
malaria tablets or forgotten to use her
83:53
mosquito net
83:54
she might have caught malaria living in
83:56
Miriah and unfortunately this is the
84:00
reality for many of the people she
84:02
worked with who couldn't afford tablets
84:04
or mosquito nets the only way to prevent
84:09
getting malaria
84:10
it's to sleep under a treated mosquito
84:14
net and of course local people can't
84:19
afford to buy them they're not provided
84:22
free by the government they are given
84:25
out by some charities some of the time
84:30
the volunteers all knew that if the nets
84:33
weren't used properly they wouldn't
84:34
protect anyone from malaria
84:36
so education was an essential part of
84:39
their work you need to understand why
84:46
you need the net what you're preventing
84:49
and how it is best to use the net so the
84:54
project that I was working on really
84:56
believed that giving and that alone
84:59
isn't enough you need to have an
85:03
education package with it it was quite a
85:09
change from Pam's life in England
85:13
Pam lived in the community and had to
85:16
adapt to a very different standard of
85:18
living although there were also many
85:20
similarities surprisingly you can go to
85:26
a cash point you can go to a hole in the
85:28
wall you can get some money out of your
85:31
UK bank account if you need it having a
85:34
said you can go to the hole in the wall
85:36
some days it doesn't work some days this
85:40
in their electricity it's very much the
85:42
same there are shops of a sort
85:46
lucky Stefan supermarket which we used
85:50
to joke that if there were seven things
85:52
you wanted you were lucky but you just
85:56
adjust your life
86:03
[Music]
86:11
Pam spent two years in Uganda and became
86:15
part of the community in Miria through
86:17
her work she didn't just help to change
86:20
the lives of many people she cared for
86:21
she changed her own life - I don't think
86:27
I will ever be the same again I feel
86:30
differently about how I live here
86:32
I feel differently about how my family
86:34
live and I've now been back over here
86:38
and I still haven't been into a big
86:43
supermarket if Pam hadn't gone to Uganda
86:47
she would have missed out on a
86:49
life-changing experience but is there
86:52
anything that she would do differently
86:53
if she could do it all again I were to
86:59
have the experience again I probably
87:01
would have done more homework before I
87:05
left I bought the guide to Uganda and I
87:08
bought a map and I thought that was
87:12
probably enough preparation if I could
87:16
do it again I probably would make more
87:19
effort to contact more people who had
87:22
actually been in Uganda for as a
87:26
volunteer or working short term so that
87:30
I could have been better prepared for
87:32
what to expect professionally and
87:36
culturally from first hand rather than
87:39
from a book many people are surprised at
87:43
Pam's decision to start work for VSO at
87:45
the age of 60 but she believes that
87:47
waiting until she retired was a good
87:50
thing I don't think I could have done
87:53
this when I was younger I wouldn't have
87:58
had the confidence to do it I would not
88:03
have had the skills to have done what I
88:07
actually did in merrier
88:09
as a nurse
88:11
and I don't think I would have survived
88:15
very well I don't know but personally
88:19
for me I think it was the right time and
88:24
it would not have worked so well had I
88:28
gone when I was younger and what was the
88:32
most rewarding part of her two years in
88:34
Uganda people asked this question quite
88:38
a lot and um it would be quite easy to
88:42
say that during the time that I was
88:45
there that we distributed over 6000
88:48
mosquito nets so that I know that 6000
88:51
families for benefiting but it was the
88:57
friendships and people that I met and
89:00
that contact with ordinary people in
89:03
Africa and visiting their homes sitting
89:07
on the floor in their mud hut laughing
89:09
over something is a joy and an
89:12
experience I don't think you can buy and
89:14
I felt very very privileged to to be
89:18
able to do that

formed in 1971 with borders to Saudi

90:18
it's the second largest emirate and the
90:20
UAE s biggest city Dubai that's become
90:23
its most internationally well-known and
90:28
it's the stunning architecture of the
90:30
city that is its most distinctive and
90:33
recognizable feature
90:35
[Music]
90:37
buildings like the seven star luxury
90:40
burj al arab hotel and the amazing burj
90:44
khalifa dominate the city but what's
90:48
remarkable when you see the towering
90:50
skyline today is that if you had visited
90:53
Dubai just fifty years ago
90:54
this city would have been almost totally
90:57
unrecognizable before the 1950s Dubai
91:03
was a small but thriving port at the
91:05
mouth of the Dubai Creek
91:07
[Music]
91:09
members of the banyas tribe led by the
91:12
Maktoum family had settled in the area
91:14
in 1833 and what was once a tiny fishing
91:19
village had grown into a center of trade
91:21
in their region
91:23
[Music]
91:27
traders from Iran and India brought
91:30
their fish spices pearls and fabric by

91:41
the canal between the deira and bird

Dubai sides of the city was full of
91:47
trading barges and traditional boats
91:50
called cows with their distinctive sails

91:59
but in the 1960s everything started to
92:03
change oil was discovered in the region
92:08
[Music]
92:17
today it's impossible to think about
92:20
Dubai without thinking about its
92:22
extraordinary architecture with more
92:25
than 60 buildings over 200 metres high
92:28
skyscrapers dominate the heart of the
92:30
city two of the most talked-about
92:33
structures are the Burj Al Arab and the
92:36
Burj Khalifa the Burj Khalifa was
92:41
officially opened in January 2010 and at
92:46
over 828 meters it was the tallest
92:49
building in the world remarkably it only
92:56
took one thousand three hundred and
92:58
twenty five days to build the tower at
93:04
one point there were over 12,000 people
93:06
working on the tower at the same time
93:09
with workers from a hundred different
93:11
countries
93:16
the building cost about 1.5 billion
93:19
dollars there are thousands of people
93:25
living and working on the 160 floors of
93:29
the tower along with the hotel there are
93:33
37 floors of offices over a thousand
93:36
apartments and one of the biggest
93:38
shopping malls in the world inside
93:43
on level 124 there's an observation deck
93:48
with stunning views across the city and
93:50
coastline by Dubai standards the burj al
93:55
arab hotel is almost an historic
93:58
building and a short one - the hotel
94:02
opened in 1999 and stands at a mere 321
94:07
meters inside it's like a vast palace
94:12
where guests can enjoy themselves in
94:15
seven star luxury but it's the
94:18
distinctive shape of the building that
94:20
has made it an architectural icon the
94:23
hotel stands on a man-made island 280
94:27
meters from the coast and its design
94:30
mirrors the shape of the sail of a
94:32
traditional Arabian Dao in this way the
94:37
contemporary building is linked with the
94:39
city's heritage as a trading port this
94:43
connection between the past and present
94:45
is something that can easily be lost in
94:47
the forest of modern metal and glass
94:49
high-rise structures
94:52
[Music]
95:01
so much of Dubai's brand-new that it
95:04
sometimes feels that the traditions of
95:07
the Emirati culture could get lost but
95:13
there are elements of traditional
95:15
architecture that are not only being
95:17
preserved but becoming increasingly
95:19
popular in modern designs Ireland or
95:24
Bachelor is an architect who has worked
95:26
extensively in the Middle East I'm an
95:30
architect by training but I specialized
95:32
in historic buildings and the
95:34
conservation of historic buildings and
95:36
historic areas
95:39
Aylin has spent time looking at the
95:41
historic buildings in Dubai
95:44
the main architectural tradition of the
95:47
main house type of this enricher
95:49
merchants with the choral built
95:51
courtyards houses and they were square
95:56
or rectangular with a big courtyards in
95:58
the middle that would provide shades
96:00
during the hot summer days and most
96:04
notably they had wind towers which is a
96:06
an idea the Iranian merchants brought
96:09
from Iran with them when they settled in
96:12
Dubai in the past wind towers served a
96:16
very practical purpose they were an
96:19
early form of air conditioning the air
96:24
captured by the tower circulated around
96:27
the home keeping it cool in summer when
96:30
the temperature can rise above 50
96:32
degrees and today wind towers are
96:36
increasingly common even in new
96:38
buildings but with modern technology are
96:44
they still needed not in the hugely
96:49
practical sense because buildings are
96:51
sort of built and cooled in very
96:53
different ways using air conditioning
96:55
and a lot more mechanical ways but its
96:58
remains a very strong symbol of Dubai's
97:01
so if people talk about traditional
97:03
architecture and to buy the wind tower
97:04
is is that sort of known symbol and
97:08
therefore many new buildings in Dubai
97:12
have used the wind tower in one form or
97:15
another in more in a sort of symbolic
97:17
way rather than natural useful way
97:24
Dubai is a city of many faces and there
97:28
is pride in different forms of
97:30
architecture there is pride in historic
97:33
buildings that have survived and that
97:34
have been restored there is pride when
97:37
people choose to use the wind tower in
97:39
their architecture in their buildings
97:41
and they are sort of well talked about
97:44
amongst locals at the same time they're
97:47
all they're very proud of technological
97:49
innovation and buildings that are
97:51
breaking boundaries that are the highest
97:54
the biggest and gradually moving towards
97:58
buildings it's a highly energy efficient
98:01
things so there is pride in all these
98:04
different elements so like the sale of
98:09
the Burj Al Arab the architectural
98:12
design of the wind tower is a strong
98:14
symbol of both old and new Dubai and
98:17
it's this combination of old and new
98:20
that makes the city such an interesting
98:22
place for architecture

Sherlock Holmes is not only one of the
98:46
most famous detectives in the world of
98:48
English literature he was also one of
98:51
the first today when detectives appear
98:54
in so many books and television programs
98:57
around the world it's hard to imagine
98:59
just how exciting the Sherlock Holmes
99:01
stories must have been when they were
99:03
first published in the late 19th century
99:06
the creator of Sherlock Holmes was the
99:09
Scottish author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
99:12
born in Scotland in 1859 and educated in
99:16
medicine and Edinburgh University Conan
99:19
Doyle was a scientist as well as a
99:21
writer and it was the combination of
99:24
these two interests that shaped the
99:26
character of his groundbreaking
99:27
detective Sherlock Holmes while Sherlock
99:32
Holmes was a fictional character Arthur
99:34
Conan Doyle was often inspired by
99:37
real-life criminal cases Conan Doyle's
99:40
writing was also very influential in the
99:43
development of what was at the time the
99:46
new detective technique of forensic
99:49
science dr. Carolyn Morton teaches
99:52
forensic science at the University of
99:54
the West of England in Bristol forensic
99:58
science is using science to help
100:00
investigate crimes and then bring
100:02
evidence to court there's a range of
100:05
evidence that's very useful the best
100:07
would be something like DNA or
100:09
fingerprint evidence where we might be
100:11
able to say with a fingerprint that one
100:13
particular person must have left that
100:15
fingerprint DNA is extremely good but
100:20
all sorts of things like mud on
100:22
someone's shoes fibers from their
100:24
clothing a bit of broken glass all sorts
100:27
of things can be a link between a person
100:29
and the scene of a crime she explains
100:32
more about Conan Doyle's impact on the
100:35
science there's not much record
100:38
until really the end of the 19th century
100:41
beginning of the 20th century and Sir
100:45
Arthur Conan Doyle who invented Sherlock
100:47
Holmes in many ways led the way he was
100:51
giving the police and the scientists
100:52
ideas he was trained as a doctor he knew
100:57
about investigating crime looking at
101:00
post-mortem injuries and in his stories
101:03
Sherlock Holmes was investigating using
101:05
some science so he was coming up with
101:08
ideas for linking people to places
101:11
following their footprints mud on
101:13
trousers that people weren't doing and
101:15
he made people think how to use science
101:17
to solve crime today we often hear about
101:30
forensic science being used to solve
101:32
crime a lot of criminals may have
101:35
avoided the police if they hadn't left
101:38
fingerprints or DNA evidence at the
101:40
scene of their crimes but now we know
101:43
more about forensic science from
101:45
fictional television programs than from
101:47
factual news reports and one program
101:50
more than any other might be responsible
101:52
for this the American crime drama CSI
101:56
crime scene investigation dr. Lindsey
102:00
Steinberg is writing a book about
102:02
forensic science in popular culture so
102:05
CSI starts in 2000 the original series
102:09
is called CSI crime scene investigation
102:12
and it is about a group of people
102:14
solving crimes in Las Vegas it is so
102:18
popular that it has two spin-off series
102:22
the first series is CSI Miami and the
102:27
second which follows several years later
102:29
is CSI in New York
102:31
and CSI is a global phenomenon the three
102:37
programs are shown in over 200 countries
102:39
to a global audience of around 2 billion
102:42
people what's interesting about the
102:45
current forensic science craze on
102:47
television
102:48
is that much of it actually isn't new
102:53
Sherlock Holmes is always doing
102:55
experiments in his house
102:57
he's always referring to to all the
102:59
books that he's written about about
103:02
footprints or cigar ashes and he uses
103:05
that knowledge to help him solve the
103:08
crimes at hand now that is very similar
103:10
to what happens in the laboratories at
103:12
CSI what has perhaps changed a little
103:17
bit is what's going on in the
103:20
development of science so with the
103:24
discovery of DNA for example now we have
103:26
a different procedure generally every
103:30
CSI episode has the same structure
103:33
there's a crime
103:34
the crime-scene investigators examine
103:37
the scene collect evidence and take it
103:39
back to their laboratory they test the
103:42
evidence and it will show who committed
103:44
the crime this person will be arrested
103:48
and they will confess so why does
103:52
Lindsey think these stories are so
103:54
popular I think CSI really convinced us
103:58
that in a world that is increasingly
104:01
frightening where answers aren't clear
104:06
where we're not sure who to trust we can
104:08
always trust science they really show
104:11
science as being able to tell us the
104:14
absolute truth now science isn't really
104:17
like it is on television and I think
104:19
everybody who watches TV knows that but
104:23
it would be really nice if it was I
104:25
think what we want is is a system like
104:29
the science on television that can tell
104:30
us truth that can tell us who's good
104:33
who's bad and I think that's why it's so
104:36
popular
104:38
[Music]
104:48
obviously we all know that science can't
104:51
be like it is on television so what's it
104:54
really like dr. Morton helps to train
104:59
investigators in a special crime scene
105:01
house where rooms are adapted to
105:04
resemble real crime scenes teachers can
105:07
observe the students working in the
105:09
house dr. Morton explains some of the
105:13
differences between the television
105:15
version and a reality the first thing
105:18
that happens is a crime scene is sealed
105:21
off and nobody enters you think about
105:23
where you're going to find the evidence
105:25
and how you're going to go about this
105:28
search
105:28
there are a lot of decisions to be made
105:30
before you go in and I haven't often
105:32
seen that in television then you have to
105:34
get kitted up the protective suits so
105:36
that you don't leave any evidence from
105:38
your own clothing or your own hair your
105:41
own DNA at the scene so a mask gloves
105:44
the whole suit one of the big issues
105:51
with television dramas generally is that
105:54
one or two people do the work of maybe
105:57
40 professionals in the real world and
106:00
of course none of those meet the suspect
106:03
and ask questions the other thing is the
106:05
speed with which everything is resolved
106:08
can take a long time to do a lot of the
106:10
work in the lab and to do a lot of the
106:12
police investigation despite real
106:17
forensic investigation being so
106:19
different from the television version
106:21
one of the most remarkable things about
106:23
the popularity of CSI is that it looks
106:26
like the programs are influencing real
106:28
life in a number of ways good and bad
106:34
this has become known as the CSI effect
106:41
one positive outcome is that more people
106:44
want to study science at University the
106:49
CSI effect isn't just about the about
106:52
the law about the legal system it's also
106:57
it's also changed the way the education
107:00
system works and in many ways because
107:02
lots of people want to take degrees in
107:05
forensic science
107:07
so the CSI effect is widespread and it
107:11
is it is sort of changing the way that
107:15
we think about how science fits into our
107:17
culture but there are problems to
107:24
real-life and TV drama are not one on
107:27
the same and there's some evidence that
107:29
the CSI effect might be influencing the
107:32
way people behave when they're on a jury
107:37
what they expect when they go serve on a
107:39
jury is that Criminal Investigations
107:43
will work the same in real life as they
107:45
do on TV and there's been many
107:47
interviews with lawyers who are very
107:50
very worried about this and as a
107:52
forensic scientist Carolyn has concerns
107:55
about the CSI effect I think the biggest
108:00
negative is that people expect too much
108:03
they expect the police to solve crimes
108:06
very very quickly to always find perfect
108:09
evidence they expect the evidence to
108:13
prove guilt and prove what happened and
108:17
dramas are always starting with the
108:20
ending known and you work a story
108:23
towards that end real situations start
108:27
with the ending unknown you'd start not
108:30
knowing who the offender was not knowing
108:33
if you will find them like Sherlock
108:35
Holmes before them the fictional
108:37
characters of CSI have captured the
108:40
imagination of the public who still love
108:42
murder mysteries and who knows maybe a
108:46
hundred years from now people will still
108:48
be watching CSI to
108:50

109:07
one of my all-time personal heroes is
109:10
Professor Richard Fineman I just think
109:14
he was an outstanding extraordinary man
109:22
Richard Fineman was born in New York
109:24
City in May 1918 he developed some of
109:30
the greatest physics theories of the
109:31
20th century and in 1965 Fineman was
109:36
awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics many
109:39
people argue that he is as important as
109:41
Einstein in the development of the
109:43
science Fineman was also passionate
109:46
about teaching physics throughout his
109:49
career he turned down jobs at many
109:51
prestigious universities because they
109:53
didn't offer the opportunity to
109:55
regularly teach students his lectures
109:57
had a reputation for being entertaining
109:59
as well as educational and he was known
110:03
for being a talented musician and artist
110:05
as well as having one of the greatest
110:07
minds of the last hundred years when he
110:12
was on a sabbatical working at a
110:15
university in South America
110:18
he went off and joined a Samba band he
110:21
was a skilled artist and he learned how
110:24
to break into safes because I think he
110:28
was a little bored at one time but he
110:30
was just fascinated by how things work
110:33
and why they work which is what made him
110:36
such a great person and such a great
110:38
teacher Fineman died on February 15th
110:41
1988 at the age of 69 it is reported
110:45
that his last words were I'd hate to die
110:48
twice it's so boring
110:51
I found Richard Fineman inspirational
110:56
for many reasons he was a truly great
111:00
physicist he was an inspirational
111:03
teacher and probably one of the best
111:06
teachers of physics that we will ever
111:08
see
111:08
but above all of that there was his
111:11
childish enthusiasm for everything he
111:15
came into contact with we still have
111:18
access to richard fineman and i would
111:20
recommend anybody just to go onto the
111:22
internet and put in richard fineman
111:24
and you can see videos of his lectures
111:27
with people and just sits and listened
111:30
and watched the man he has even in his
111:33
later life such enthusiasm for his
111:36
subject when you're watching on the

child she became the program's first
112:24
female head writer in 1999 and started
112:27
acting on-screen in 2000 Fey has written
112:32
produced and starred in a number of
112:34
films she created her own television
112:37
sitcom called 30 rock and she has won

countless awards for acting and writing
112:44
she is now considered to be one of the
112:46
most powerful women in the u.s.
112:48
entertainment industry I remember
112:51
growing up thinking in most of the
112:53
comedian's that I saw on television or
112:55
in films were all male Tina Fey has
112:58
changed things so that now films like
113:01
bridesmaids can come out and women are
113:04
funny and in the same way that men are
113:08
funny and I feel like that reflects the
113:12
reality of life because women are funny
113:14
there are a lot of very very funny women
113:16
who are quirky and witty ghen and I feel
113:19
like now our television and films are
113:23
actually finally catching up Tina Fey
113:25
has often spoken about being a woman in
113:28
the male-dominated comedy world while
113:31
she has said that men and women
113:32
sometimes prefer different jokes
113:34
she believes that most of the time funny
113:37
is simply funny
113:39
she's uh she's smart and she's one of
113:42
those people that is not afraid to say
113:46
what she means and to take control and
113:48
she's not afraid to step on people's
113:51
toes because I think she realizes that
113:53
strong women need to be there to get
113:55
things done

114:07
someone I really admire is unsung suci
114:11
the Burmese political protester and fan
114:20
SUCI was born in Rangoon in 1945 her
114:26
father a Burmese independence hero was
114:30
assassinated when she was just two years
114:32
old she left Burma when she was 15 but
114:37
after studying and living around the
114:39
world for many years she returned home
114:42
in 1988 she said that as her father's
114:47
daughter she could not remain
114:49
indifferent to all that was going on in
114:51
her country which was being run by a
114:54
military regime she was first arrested
114:58
for her political activities in 1990 and
115:02
she spent much of the next 20 years
115:04
either in prison or under house arrest
115:07
in Rangoon in 1991 and San Suchi was
115:16
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize as she was
115:19
unable to leave Burma her British
115:22
husband Michael and her sons Alexander
115:25
and Kim collected the award for her
115:30
ank's and Suchi has insisted that even
115:33
when she was in prison she was always
115:35
free because the people holding her were
115:38
not able to touch the things that
115:40
mattered her mind her principles and
115:43
what she believed in over the years and
115:48
Sam su Chi became one of the most
115:51
recognizable and high-profile political
115:54
prisoners and people around the world
115:57
continued to campaign for her release
115:59
which finally happened in November 2010
116:04
she's someone that I admire a lot
116:08
because of her strong belief in the
116:11
power of peaceful protests she could
116:15
have left the country several times and
116:19
returned to England to be with her
116:20
husband and her children but she decided
116:24
to stay in Burma because she didn't
116:28
think that she would be allowed back
116:30
into the country so she chose
116:33
imprisonment or house arrest because of
116:37
the things that she believed in and I
116:40
find that quite incredible and quite
116:42
inspiring
116:43
you
