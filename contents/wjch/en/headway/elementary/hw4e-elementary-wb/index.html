<li>All right, hello everyone, today's topic, rather this week's topic is 'Going to a restaurant'. You can see, this is Part one. We have five parts. Now over these videos, I will give you a little of sample sentences. I hope that you will write these sentences down and learn them. All right, that is your homework, I trust you to do it. All right, so in the first part, we will talk about how to choose a restaurant. So, how to talk to a friend and decide which restaurant would you like to go to. There are three ways that we do this.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-one-choosing-a-restaurant">Part one: Choosing a restaurant</h3>
<ul>
<li>Page 1</li>
<li>In part one, we will talk about how to choose a restaurant in English.</li>
<li>We do this by:</li>
<li>1 Choosing a <strong>specific food</strong> we want to eat</li>
<li>2 Choosing a <strong>country</strong> whose food we want to eat</li>
<li>3 Choosing a <strong>flavor</strong> we'd like to eat</li>
<li>
<p>So... we're hungry. Where should we go?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firstly, we choose a specific food we want to eat. Oh now, I really want pizza, I really want burgers.</p>
</li>
<li>Number two, we choose a country whose food we want to eat. Oh, I really want some Chinese food.</li>
<li>
<p>Or three, choosing a flavor we'd like to eat. Emm, I really want something sweet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 2</p>
</li>
<li>1 Choosing a specific food we'd like to eat.</li>
<li>This one is quite easy. Just say what you feel like eating.</li>
<li>"I really want some (pizza)."</li>
<li>"I feel like some (fried rice)."</li>
<li>"I could go for some (soup rice) right now."</li>
<li>
<p>"Some (salad) would sure hit the spot!" </p>
<ul>
<li>hit the spot 使人满足；正合需要；恰到好处</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need some examples. You can put almost (here list) into these gaps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fried chicken, Omelet, Pizza, Kebab, Fish, Steak, Pasta, Rice, Soup, Broth, Tossed salad, Dressing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 3</p>
</li>
<li>2 Choosing a country/area whose food we want to eat.</li>
<li>For this we use the demonym (区域居民称谓词, demo = people)</li>
<li>Chinese, Mexican, French, Italian, German, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, Filipino, American, Korean, Spanish</li>
<li>
<p>Cantonese 粤菜, Sichuanese 川菜, Hunanese 湘菜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 4</p>
</li>
<li>3 Choosing a flavor we'd like to eat.</li>
<li>"I feel like something ()"<ul>
<li>sweet, savory, spicy, sour, light</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or mention a key ingredient you'd like to eat</p>
<ul>
<li>meat, vegetables, rice, noodles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 5</p>
</li>
<li>Other phrasings you can use:</li>
<li>"I haven't had (Chinese food) in a long time."</li>
<li>"I wouldn't mind trying (Indian food)."</li>
<li>"Let's try something new. How about (Indonesian food)."</li>
<li>"Let's just go wherever is closest."</li>
<li>"I don't care where we go, so long as it's not expensive."</li>

<li>Restaurants that are very nice or very popular will require people to make a reservation. 预约</li>
<li>At less popular restaurants, you can be seated without a reservation. 在不太受欢迎的餐馆里，你可以不预订而就坐。</li>
<li>
<p>As we talked about previously, some restaurants only serve food "to go"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 7</p>
</li>
<li>Making restaurants reservations in English should be thought of as a <strong>polite conversation</strong> about what the customer needs.</li>
<li>Date and time</li>
<li>Number of people who are going</li>
<li>Special requirements</li>
<li>
<p>Customer's name and phone number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 8</p>
</li>
<li>H: Hi, I'd like to make a reservation please.</li>
<li>R: Sure. Which day and at what time would you like to make the reservation?</li>
<li>H: This Friday at 7 PM.</li>
<li>R: And how many people will you be coming with?</li>
<li>H: There are six of us.</li>
<li>R: OK. Can I have a name for the reservation, please?</li>
<li>H: Harold. Harold Jones.</li>
<li>H: Oh, I almost forgot. Can we have a table near a window, please? And in a non-smoking section?</li>
<li>R: Our restaurant is entirely non smoking. We can't promise you a window seat, but we'll do our best.</li>
<li>H: Thank you. If a window seat is unavailable, then anything that's not too close to the kitchen will be fine.</li>
<li>H: One last question: what's parking like at the restaurant?</li>
<li>R: We have a parking lot behind the restaurant, and there's also space on the street for parking if you need it. Do any of the guests have special needs?</li>
<li>H: Oh, yes! One of us is bringing a baby. Would you be able to provide a high chair?</li>
<li>
<p>R: That won't be a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 9</p>
</li>
<li>In restaurants without reservations, all you need to do is ask for a table.</li>
<li>"Hi can we get a table for three, please?"</li>
<li>You may have to wait for other customers to finish their meals and leave, or if you have a lot of people you may have to wait for a larger table to become available.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-four-ordering">part four: Ordering</h3>
<ul>
<li>Page 10</li>
<li>In this part, we'll discuss ordering at a restaurant.</li>
<li>Once you've looked at the menu and decided what you'd like to order, all you need to do is politely ask for it. Easy.</li>
<li>
<p>But the waiter/worker might ask you some questions about your order. Perhaps you have questions for them. Not as easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 11</p>
</li>
<li>Firstly, remember to always use polite language.</li>
<li>Can I/could I<ul>
<li>Can I have a Coke, please?</li>
<li>Could I get the chicken soup with toast, please?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>would like </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like a latte with no sugar, thanks.</li>
<li>latte /ˈlɑːteɪ; ˈlæteɪ/ n. 牛奶；拿铁咖啡（coffee latte）</li>
<li>I'd like a ham and cheese sandwich, please.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 12</p>
</li>
<li>The person working behind the counter will almost always begin with a hello.</li>
<li>Sometimes, they'll also ask how you are. Even at McDonald's, it's very friendly.</li>
<li>
<p>Just say hello back. If they ask how you are, say "fine, thanks!"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 13</p>
</li>
<li>Remember your tone of voice</li>
<li>If the waiter asks you if you'd like something, usually we say "yes, please" or "no, thank you"</li>
<li>
<p>But if you have a nice, friendly tone of voice you could also say yeah, yep, mmm, nah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 14</p>
</li>
<li>Have here or take away?</li>
<li>We talked about this one already.</li>
<li>Take away or take out means to leave with the food and eat it elsewhere.</li>
<li>
<p>At nice restaurants where you sit down for your meals, you won't be asked this. Places like McDonald's and KFC will ask you this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 15</p>
</li>
<li>If you aren't sure, you can ask the wait staff for suggestions.</li>
<li>"What would you recommend?"</li>
<li>"What would you suggest?"</li>
<li>"What's the best thing on the menu?"</li>
<li>"What's your favorite thing on the menu?"</li>
<li>
<p>This is a weird thing to ask at McDonald's though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 16</p>
</li>
<li>Be prepared for them to ask you further questions.</li>
<li>Would you like anything else?</li>
<li>What would you like to drink with that?<ul>
<li>Coffee, tea, juice, Coke, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How would you like your eggs?<ul>
<li>Scrambled? 炒 Fried? 煎、炸 Poached? 水煮</li>
<li>Scrambled egg：炒蛋</li>
<li>Fried eggs ：煎鸡蛋</li>
<li>Poached egg：荷包蛋</li>
<li>Boiled egg：煮蛋</li>
<li>Fried eggs on both sides：双面煎鸡来蛋</li>
<li>over eggs：煎两面荷包蛋</li>
<li>sunny side up：煎一面荷包蛋</li>
<li>over easy eggs：煎半熟蛋 （蛋黄微熟）</li>
<li>over medium eggs（蛋黄半生熟）</li>
<li>over hard eggs：煎全熟蛋 （蛋黄全熟）</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any sides with that? 要什么配菜吗? (Will that be all? 就要这些吗?)</li>
<li>How do you take your coffee?<ul>
<li>With sugar? Milk/cream? Hot/iced?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-three-menu">Part three: Menu</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All right, we are at a restaurant, we're sitting down at the table and we're looking at the menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 17</p>
</li>
<li>If you read a menu in English, you'll notice there are several different categories for food.</li>
<li>Starter: small dish served before the meal (UK)</li>
<li>Appetizer: small dish served before the meal (US)</li>
<li>Entrée: /ˈɒntreɪ/ served before the main meal (UK)</li>
<li>Entrée: /ˈɑːntreɪ/ the main meal (US) </li>
<li>Main: the main (largest) meal. Usually has meat. (because meats fill you up. Right, if you'd want to have a small plate of vegetables for your main meal.)</li>
<li>Side: something to be eaten with the main dish</li>
<li>Dessert: Ice cream, cakes, other sweet things</li>
<li>
<p>Drinks: You know what drinks are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 18</p>
</li>
<li>If you're confused about the Entrée, don't worry. It confuses me too.</li>
<li>If it helps, and Entrée is usually bigger than an appetizer or starter. That's why it got confused with the main course in American English.</li>
<li>
<p>It comes from a French word meaning "enter", which is why it's one of the first courses. (unless in America, that is the main meal.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 19</p>
</li>
<li>Sides are something we have with the main dish.</li>
<li>They are put either on one side of the plate, or on a separate plate next to your main dish.</li>
<li>Some meals will have a side salad or options for the customer to add things "on the side".</li>
<li>
<p>"I'll have the steak please, with fried potatoes on the side."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 20</p>
</li>
<li>Even more confusingly, starters and appetizers can also used as sides, because they're smaller dishes.</li>
<li>Sometimes people will order mains for them selves, plus some starters/appetizers/sides to share together.</li>
<li>Just remember!</li>
<li>Starters, appetizers, sides = SMALL</li>
<li>
<p>Main = LARGE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 21</p>
</li>
<li>On the left, you can see the mains broken down into categories.</li>
<li>On the right, mains are called Entrées. There's also a kid's menu.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-five-paying-for-your-food">Part five: Paying for your food</h3>
<ul>
<li>Page 22</li>
<li>Last but not least 最后重要一点: Paying for your food.</li>
<li>The final part, of course "Paying for your food", you don't get food for free for a restaurant.</li>
<li>Some places will make you pay for your food before they serve it to you. At some places you pay after the meal.</li>
<li>
<p>Usually, places where you sit down to eat will have you pay after the meal, because there's a good chance you'll order more before you finish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 23</p>
</li>
<li>When you have finished your meal and want to pay, you can say:</li>
<li>Could I have the check please?</li>
<li>Could we get the bill please?</li>
<li>We'd like to pay now, please.</li>
<li>We're ready for the bill now.</li>
<li>We're ready to pay the bill/check now.</li>
<li>
<p>Bill/check (America) = 单</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 24</p>
</li>
<li>Sometimes the bill is brought to you. Other times you will have to go to the front counter to pay.</li>
<li>You will be asked how you want to pay.</li>
<li>
<p>Cash and bank cards are the most common ways to pay. Mobile payment services like WeChat and Alipay aren't very popular yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 25 SPLIT THE BILL</p>
</li>
<li>If many people are eating together, then paying the bill can be a little bit awkward.</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike China where people fight to pay the bill, Westerners prefer it if the cost is shared fairly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 26 SPLIT THE BILL</p>
</li>
<li>One option is to split the bill, which means everyone pays the same amount. This is good if you all ate and drank the same amount of food.</li>
<li>
<p>But if you had an appetizer and a glass of water, you don't want to pay the same as your friends who had large meals and many drinks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 27 SEPARATE CHECKS</p>
</li>
<li>Another option is to get separate checks. This means each person gets a bill for the food and drink that they ordered.</li>
<li>
<p>This is fair, but it creates more work for the people at the restaurant, especially if you have a lot of people. If they have to go and make 10 different checks, they probably won't be happy!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page 28 MOBILE PAYMENTS</p>
</li>
<li>Thankfully, mobile payments are slowly becoming popular. Apps like Venmo and Apple Pay mean only one person has to get the check and everyone else can pay them back.</li>
<li>Send money and make purchases.</li>
