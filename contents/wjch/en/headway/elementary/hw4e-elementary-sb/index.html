<li>Oprah was born on January 29, 1954, in Kosciusko, Mississippi. Her parents were very poor. Her father, Vernon, worked in a <strong>coal mine</strong> and her mother, Vernita, <strong>cleaned houses</strong>. They couldn't <strong>look after</strong> Oprah, so she <strong>lived with</strong> her grandmother, Hattie Mae. Oprah was clever. She could read before she was three. When she was 17, she received a <strong>scholarship to</strong> Tennessee State University, where she studied drama. She also <strong>started reading</strong> the news <strong>at</strong> the local radio station.</li>

<li>C Her success</li>
<li>In 1984, Oprah moved to Chicago to <strong>work on</strong> a TV <strong>talk show</strong> called A.M. Chicago. She talked to lots of interesting people about their problems. Oprah says,"People's problems are my problems." The show was very successful, so in 1985, it was renamed The Oprah Winfrey Show. 49 million people in 134 countries watched it every week. In 1993, she interviewed Michael Jackson and 100 million people watched the programme. Last year, she earned $260,000,000.<ul>

She says,"When I was a kid, we were poor and we didn't have much money. So what did I do? I studied hard."

<li>B Good morning. What beautiful tuna! How long did it take to catch them?</li>
<li>F Oh, about two hours.</li>
<li>B Only two hours! Amazing! Why didn't you fish for longer and catch more?</li>
<li>F I didn't want to fish for longer. With this I have enough fish for my family.</li>
<li>B But what do you do with the rest of your day? Aren't you bored?</li>
<li>F I'm never bored. I get up late, play with my children, watch football, and take a siesta with my wife. Sometimes in the evenings, I walk to the village to see my friends, play the guitar, and sing some songs.</li>
<li>B Really? That's all you do? Look, I am a very successful businessman. I went to Harvard University and I studied business. I can help you. Fish for four hours every day and sell the extra fish you catch ...</li>
<li>F But...</li>
<li>B ... Then, you can buy a bigger boat, catch more, and earn more money.</li>
<li>F But...</li>
<li>B ... Then buy a second boat, a third, and so on, until you have a big fleet of fishing boats.</li>
<li>F But...</li>
<li>B ... and you can export the fish, and leave this village, and move to Mexico City, or LA or New York, and open a fishing business.</li>
<li>F OK, OK, but how long will all this take?</li>
<li>B Er- let me think -er probably about 15 to 20 years.</li>
<li>F 15 to 20 years! And then what, Senor?</li>
<li>B Why, that's the exciting part! You can sell your business and become very rich, a millionaire.</li>
<li>F A millionaire? Really? But what do I do with all the money?</li>
<li>B Well, Iet me think. Erm- I know you can stop work, and -er, move to a lovely, old fishing village where you can sleep late, play with your grandchildren, watch football, take a siesta with your wife, and walk to the village in the evenings where you can play the guitar, and sing with your friends all you want.</li>
<li>F Mmmm - well ...</li>

<li>Everyone here is worried about the exams. They start next week, like yours. It was good to forget about them for the weekend! I miss you a lot. Come and visit me soon - it's cheap on the coach.</li>

<li>Dear Mr and Mrs Owen.</li>
<li>I'd like to thank you so much for having me to stay last weekend. I had a really lovely time, and I was so pleased to meet you at last. The meal you made was delicious. Duncan told me that his mother was an excellent cook - and he was right. I also enjoyed our walk - the countryside and woods near your house are beautiful.</li>
<li>The journey back was long and I slept for most of the way. lt was very kind of you to drive me to the station so early in the morning. I was very grateful!</li>
<li>It's good to be back at university. I have a lot of work at the moment before the exams start. I know Duncan has exams too, so we can't see each other until the end of June - we are just too busy!</li>
<li>I'd love to visit again in the summer holidays with Duncan.</li>
<li>Thank you again for everything.</li>

<p>Well, I like both London and Paris. But they are very different cities. Take transport for example. The Metro is cheaper and easier to use than the Underground. And the weather ... well, Paris is certainly hotter than London. And Paris, in fact, is wetter than London; but in London there are more wet days. What about the buildings? Well, ... people say that the architecture in Paris is more beautiful, but the buildings in London are more interesting. And living in the two cities? Well . .. life is faster in London. And the people? ... Mmm, Londoners are generally more polite than Parisians. People in London work harder, and they earn more. In Paris, having a good time is more important.</p>

<li>Makiko from Tokyo</li>
<li>The first thing to say about Tokyo is that it is very safe. Women can walk everywhere anytime day or night. Little children walk to school. You can leave something on the table in a restaurant while you go out for a minute and nobody will take it.</li>
<li>Tokyo is also very clean, and it is very easy to travel around. All the trains and buses run on time.</li>
<li>Personally, my favourite time of year is spring, when it's dry and the cherry blossom is out.</li>
<li>
<p>Tokyo is a very exciting city, because there are always new things to do, new places to go, new things to eat. It changes very quickly!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vimahl from Mumbai</p>
</li>
<li>I have two strong impressions of Mumbai.</li>
<li>First, it is a city that is so full of activity! It is busy busy busy all day long and all night long!</li>
<li>It's a city that doesn't sleep much. The day begins early because it is so hot. It's a noisy place. There are cars going beep beep, auto rickshaws by the thousand, fast trains rushing past, vendors shouting and trying to get you to buy their food, their drinks, their clothes. And people, people everywhere trying to get to work.</li>
<li>
<p>The second thing to say is that the people are very, very enthusiastic. Life isn't easy in Mumbai for a lot of people, but we really work hard and we really want to do our best. Every new day brings new possibilities! The future is exciting for us!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lourdes from Mexico City</p>
</li>
<li>There are three things I like about living in Mexico City. First, the weather. It is warm and sunny most of the year. The second is the fresh fruit and vegetables - the markets are wonderful, the colours and smells are great! And the third is that I'm never bored because there is so much to see and do! We have museums, theatres, art exhibitions, parks, restaurants, bars ... everything!</li>
<li>My favourite time of year in Mexico City is the end of December, from the l6th to the 3lst. The city is full of lights, there are parties everywhere, and we eat and drink and give presents. Everyone's really happy! I love it!</li>

<li>I'm really excited about my trip to Europe. I haven't travelled much outside Australia before. Just once, two years ago, I went on holiday to Bali with my family but I've never been to Europe or the US. I often travel inside Australia. Last year I flew to Perth to visit my cousin, who lives there. It's a five-hour flight from Sydney, where I live. Australia's a big country! Also, I've been up to Cairns in the north three times. I learned to scuba dive there on the Great Barrier Reef.</li>
<li>We've just finished packing, and now we're waiting for the taxi to take us to the airport. I've never flown on a 747 before.It's a very long flight. It takes 20 hours to get to Rome. I'm going to watch films all the way. I can't wait!</li>

<p>OK, I've been to Glastonbury five times now. My highlights this year were: pear cider to drink, and the American diner van with the best sausages and chips ever. However, I was very disappointed with the music on Saturday night. Dls played House music all night. I love House but this was rubbish. I got really bored, so I went back to my tent to finish a bottle of pear cider with friends!</p>

<li>Last Wednesday at 2.30 in the afternoon, I decided that I wanted to go to Glastonbury. I was lucky! I found a ticket on the Glastonbury message boards. I'm so glad I went. The music was brilliant. Sometimes it took a long time to get to the stages.The queues were long but always friendly. In the busy "real world" it's difficult to have good conversations with people. At Glastonbury you can do this. It's a great festival, with a great crowd of people. What more could you want? 100,000 friendly people. I wish the rest of life was the same! Four days out of 365 is a good start!</li>

very clean and it is very easy to travel

time personally my favorite time of year

is spring when it's dry and the cherry
132:15
blossom is out Tokyo is a very exciting
132:19
city because there are always new things
132:23
to do new places to go new things to eat
132:27
it changes very quickly we my from
132:33
Mumbai I have two strong impressions of

Mumbai first it is a city that is so
132:40
full of activity it is busy busy busy
132:44
all day long and all night long it's a
132:48
city that doesn't sleep much the day
132:51
begins early because it is so hot it's a
132:55
noisy place
132:56
there are cars going beep beep auto
132:59
rickshaws by the thousand fast trains
133:02
rushing past vendors shouting and trying
133:06
to get you to buy their food their
133:08
drinks their clothes and people people
133:12
everywhere trying to get to work
133:15
the second thing to say is that the
133:18
people are very very enthusiastic life
133:22
isn't easy in Mumbai for a lot of people
133:24
but we really work hard and we really
133:28
want to do our best every new day brings
133:31
new possibilities the future is exciting
