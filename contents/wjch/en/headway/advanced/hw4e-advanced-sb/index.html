from their first taste of treading the
00:20
boards as a child in a school play some
00:22
people dream of a life working in the
00:25
theatre for most people if they are
00:28
honest it isn't studying the works of
00:30
the great playwrights in the classroom
00:32
that keeps this dream alive through the
00:34
teenage years more often than not it's
00:38
the freedom fun and excitement of drama
00:40
classes that fan the flames it's all
00:44
about getting out from behind a desk
00:46
expressing yourself becoming someone
00:48
else for a while for many it's living
00:52
life in the spotlight that is most
00:53
appealing from performing Street Theatre
00:57
in a park to starring on Broadway they
01:00
live for the adulation and applause of
01:03
the audience but for others the dream is
01:06
about making that magic happen
01:08
working unseen in the shadows behind the
01:12
scenes this is the theater by the lake
01:16
in Kazakh appropriately named the
01:20
theater sets on the shores of tranquil
01:22
Derwent water
01:24
and is surrounded by the breathtakingly
01:26
beautiful scenery of the Lake District
01:28
National Park while it feels like a
01:32
world away from the bright lights of the
01:34
West End of London the theater is one of
01:37
the most prestigious regional theaters
01:39
in the UK and most importantly it
01:43
actively works to help young people get
01:46
their first break working as part of a
01:48
highly skilled backstage team the team
01:52
is led by experienced professionals who
01:55
guide the young crew members starting
01:57
out on their careers
01:58
I mean forest and I'm artistic director
02:03
at theatres by the lake
02:04
really my job is to be responsible for
02:08
all the home produced work that we
02:13
produce in the theatre that may be in
02:17
any year up to eight productions so I
02:21
choose the plays I cast them together
02:24
with a casting director and my associate
02:27
director and then we audition for actors
02:33
and we choose our companies and then we
02:35
rehearse the plays but I think what's
02:39
great about this is it is a mix of
02:41
people with different experience and
02:43
also the good thing is that we we do
02:47
positively try and give people
02:50
opportunities early in their careers and
02:53
we've also got various apprenticeships
02:55
on the on the deck kind of technical and
02:57
production side as well so it's great I
02:59
think actually being able to to work
03:02
with people who are really enthusiastic
03:03
and keen and young it's it's really
03:07
enjoyable doing that
03:08
my name's Andrew Lindsay I'm the
03:10
technical manager here at Theatre by the
03:12
lake and I look after the sound lighting
03:15
video and staging resources technologies
03:18
and the staff that implement those here
03:20
at theatre by the lake I kind of fell
03:23
into becoming a technical manager by
03:26
accident I didn't know whether to do
03:29
music or visual arts at university when
03:32
I left school and so I went to an
03:34
institution which encompassed those
03:37
areas
03:37
and so working with music and working
03:41
with visual arts in theater setting and
03:44
then I specialize in lighting design
03:46
sound design and the technical aspects
03:49
of theater and after leaving University
03:52
I did as much professional work as
03:55
possible and to kind of broaden my
03:57
horizons a little bit and I was
04:00
fortunate enough to have a series of
04:02
permanent full-time jobs and working my
04:04
way up the ladder to become a telephone
04:07
major we have a huge range of different
04:12
technologies at our disposal we have
04:15
everything from the flying system Stage
04:18
II system which flying is a term used
04:21
for the movement of set vertically on
04:23
stage we have technologies there which
04:26
have been around for nearly 200 years
04:28
that derive from when the sailors came
04:31
off the ships and tied knots news ropes
04:33
and pulleys to move scenery and set
04:37
around when they weren't working
04:39
offshore today working behind the scenes
04:42
in the theater can be as much about
04:44
computers as it is about curtains and a
04:47
high degree of technological expertise
04:50
is required for many of the roles the
04:53
other side of the coin is that we have
04:55
high the complicated and but fantastic
05:00
digital systems which allow us to work
05:02
easily and more in depth and producing a
05:05
whole range of different theatres in
05:06
different styles the vast range of
05:10
technology now available to us means
05:12
that there's very little that we can't
05:13
do and so we have kind of both extremes
05:17
we have really hybrids digital
05:20
technology but then we have 200 year old
05:22
technology as well working hand in hand
05:24
to produce and what the ability at sea
05:26
every night
05:32
[Music]
05:43
so what is it like for the young crew
05:45
working behind the scenes what exactly
05:49
goes on in the shadows while the
05:50
audience is transfixed by the actors on
05:53
stage Charlotte and Haley are both
05:56
assistant stage managers at the theater
05:58
by the lake my name is Charlotte and I
06:01
work at theatre by the lake as the
06:03
resident assistant stage manager so in
06:07
this particular production I'm on the
06:09
book calling the show making sure all
06:12
the lighting and sound cues happen at
06:14
the right time in relation to what's
06:16
happening on stage so in this particular
06:19
case this book I had with me throughout
06:21
the rehearsal period for the four weeks
06:24
the different columns I've got I've got
06:27
like a cue column I have a calls and
06:29
information column which is anything I
06:32
need any information in little bits or
06:34
when especially when it's like a visual
06:36
cue but my last column I use during
06:39
rehearsals which is the blocking which
06:42
is every single movement that the cast
06:45
member makes throughout the show I have
06:49
to record and make a note of there's a
06:52
camera right at the front of the
06:53
auditorium that doesn't record but just
06:56
relays the show from that and it also
06:59
plays back in the green room as well
07:00
backstage so the cast can see what's
07:02
happening on stage as well and it's also
07:04
it's useful for me for various visual
07:06
cues and for instance I've got various
07:09
lighting cues simply happening when
07:11
someone turns on the light switch in one
07:13
of the rooms I have to be able to see
07:14
that happen I wear this cancer we call
07:17
it Cannes and I'm talking to either the
07:21
stage stage manager who's on the floor
07:24
who's Haley tonight and she'll be at the
07:26
beginning of the show on the concert or
07:28
she'll also be on radio if I do need her
07:32
in an emergency and but I'm also talking
07:35
to whoever's operating the show so when
07:36
I say when I call a queue for a lighting
07:39
and sound cue to happen there was
07:42
someone in the Box at the front of the
07:43
auditorium in this one making the
07:46
pressing go on the desk basically to
07:48
make sure that happens
07:50
my name is Hayley and I am the resident
07:52
assistant stage manager so I work as
07:54
part of a team of three there is a
07:56
company stage manager a deputy stage
07:58
manager and I'm on the bottom of the
08:00
ladder as the assistant stage manager
08:01
and so one of my main duties is to
08:04
source prop and borrow or buy props
08:07
furniture and set dressing for all the
08:09
shows that we do here theater by the
08:10
lake during the year so when we get here
08:14
the stage is bare and we have to pull
08:15
all the furniture and props back
08:16
together back on the stage and then we
08:19
do a shout check to make sure that
08:20
everything is there so we have a list of
08:22
where it should be and what it what it
08:23
should entail so what's in the suitcase
08:25
it goes down to quite a lot of detail
08:27
and to make sure it's there and then as
08:30
part of a show call we make sure the
08:32
actors are here and I run on this one
08:34
both wings both stage left and stage
08:37
right we're now stage left and I make
08:40
sure that the actors have all the props
08:42
that they need to go on stage with I
08:44
[Music]
08:45
think the best thing about working for
08:47
my on my job is that it is completely
08:50
different every day and you can come in
08:52
and this is different show because the
08:54
theater is live which is the best part
08:56
about it you have to deal with issues
08:57
really quickly and we had on Saturday
09:01
night one of the actors trousers fell
09:03
down on stage so you have to act really
09:05
quickly and get the safety pins and make
09:06
sure that you put your trousers back on
09:08
ready for him to go back onstage and
09:10
there is also always a little bits and
09:11
bobs that happen that makes it really
09:13
interesting and different
09:17
[Music]
09:28
we live in a world where we are
09:30
constantly deluged with numbers facts
09:33
figures and statistics in a time of data
09:38
overload the buzzword is now data
09:42
visualization this is the information is
09:48
beautiful studio and data visualization
09:51
is their business data visualization is
09:54
big at the moment largely because of the
09:57
amount of data that is being recorded by
09:59
lots of different organizations I think
10:01
that is a key part of the interest in
10:04
data visualization where people are
10:06
amassing data whether it's government's
10:07
or health organizations or Google or
10:09
Facebook there are patterns and
10:11
connections within that data that are
10:13
very difficult to see or spot without
10:15
using some kind of technique to
10:17
visualize those patterns and that's
10:19
that's where we work we look at masses
10:21
of data
10:22
occasionally it's the smaller piece of
10:24
data but largely it's about looking at
10:26
the patterns and connections that exist
10:27
within that data and making them
10:29
apparent to people and we have a
10:31
particular niche within the small
10:34
industry that already exists around data
10:35
visualization the three partners who run
10:38
the business of all journalists by trade
10:40
that's what our backgrounds are and we
10:43
have a very journalistic approach to the
10:45
work that we do so that's the difference
10:47
between us and other Studios that are
10:49
out there the story is at the heart of
10:52
everything that we do and the design and
10:54
the research and all the data is pulled
10:57
together to support that story we talk
11:00
about two different types of
11:01
visualizations we have explanatory
11:04
pieces and exploratory pieces an
11:06
explanatory piece is about getting a
11:08
message across a bit more quickly and
11:10
and we want people to be able to look at
11:11
that and recognize what is going on
11:13
fairly quickly an exploratory piece is
11:16
something where people need to spend a
11:17
bit more time with it start to extract
11:19
their own stories from the data that's
11:21
being presented to them and usually
11:23
there's a lot of different contextual
11:24
information in there that might shine a
11:26
light on another piece of information
11:27
and give you a slightly different angle
11:29
on it but it is about spending a bit
11:31
more time with that piece the team used
11:34
many different sources of data to create
11:36
their pieces sometimes data is drawn
11:39
from institutions like
11:41
the United Nations or World Health
11:43
Organization and sometimes clients
11:46
provide their own data most of the data
11:49
that we source is openly available we
11:52
only really want to use open data in the
11:54
pieces that we create and we always can
11:57
link to our data sheets we're very
11:59
transparent about our process and we
12:00
want people to be able to examine the
12:02
data that we use so that if there is
12:03
problems with it or people suspect there
12:06
may be something not quite right about
12:08
our data it's there for them to explore
12:10
and look at themselves things that we
12:13
try and avoid through the process of
12:16
visualization is this confusion and
12:19
trying to present too much data can
12:21
often be a problem so it's walking the
12:23
line between simplicity and complexity
12:25
it's how you tailor the piece to tell
12:28
the story that you're trying to tell
12:30
with the minimum of complexity and we
12:35
also try to avoid too many words these
12:38
are supposed to be visual pieces so
12:39
words play a much smaller part in the
12:41
type of work that we do so it's kind of
12:43
paring back everything to only keep the
12:46
essentials to get the message across
12:50

our goal at the beginning of the process
13:03
is to produce a high-quality piece of
13:07
journalism that engages people and that
13:10
people want to connect with all of our
13:12
pieces start with a very considered
13:17
nugget of an idea has to have a hook to
13:20
it and that's typically how a journalist
13:22
will start its looking for the hook the
13:24
idea that we think is compelling enough
13:26
to create a visualization around we then
13:29
look for the data to support that idea
13:31
or not you know it may be maybe there
13:35
isn't that maybe that data doesn't exist
13:36
but that journalistic hook is at the
13:39
heart of everything that we do and so
13:42
journalism is the star point really
13:43
and then we are using design and
13:47
editorial skills to support that idea
13:50
one of the earliest stages in the
13:53
process is choosing the best graphical
13:55
form or device for the presentation of
13:58
the data with hundreds of possible
14:01
alternatives it can be a challenging
14:03
task each device has its advantages and
14:07
disadvantages for instance bar charts
14:10
work really really well because the
14:12
human eye is particularly good at
14:14
picking up differences between
14:15
rectilinear shapes so the differences in
14:18
height between bar charts between the
14:21
different segments were but are really
14:22
easy for your eye to pick up so
14:23
therefore you can pick up that message
14:25
really really simply and quickly whereas
14:28
if you were sitting there comparing
14:29
numbers with each other it's a much more
14:31
demanding process our process begins
14:34
with this initial concept at the heart
14:37
of the piece we always write a thorough
14:40
concept first that consists of pretty
14:42
much a headline and a stand first that
14:44
describes the idea very quickly and
14:47
thoroughly to people so we're we're
14:48
pretty sure there's a hook in that
14:49
people can understand it quickly from
14:52
there we start to move into research
14:53
looking for the data that might support
14:55
that idea we use a variety of tools in
14:58
the design process
15:00
we find the sketching to be really
15:01
important we start all projects by doing
15:04
basic sketching and it helps as a memory
15:09
tool in that we can sometimes be flooded
15:11
with ideas when we start a project and
15:13
it's important to get them down so we
15:15
don't miss anything I saw some very
15:17
important to have this record a visual
15:19
record of what we've done because we can
15:22
sometimes go down a wrong path we have
15:24
to back up a little bit and we've got
15:26
them got other options ready to go from
15:29
then on we will move to the schematic
15:31
stage and that will be using digital
15:34
mock-ups to make a one-to-one
15:37
representation usually in black and
15:39
white and so we'll strip out any of the
15:41
visual styling so not to confuse
15:44
anything and purely think of it is in a
15:46
structural manner and how things are
15:49
positioned on the page and how they
15:50
interact with each other
15:51
from then on we will start to introduce
15:55
the aesthetics so we will think about
15:57
color palettes and we'll think about
15:59
typography and how the whole visual tone
16:02
of the piece fits with the actual
16:04
content so it's a combined piece of work
16:07
ultimately the completed visualization
16:10
still have to compete for attention in a
16:13
crowded multimedia marketplace with an
16:16
audience being deluged with information
16:18
presented via text photos audio and
16:21
video
16:22
so what is it that makes data
16:25
visualization really stand out we see
16:30
visualization emerging is just another
16:32
way of telling a story but the way in
16:35
which it tells it is that it has a way
16:37
of a short cutting messages to a more
16:40
primal part of your brain if you like so
16:42
how when your brain recognizes colors
16:45
and shapes and patterns more easily more
16:48
quickly than if you have to read
16:50
something or add up numbers and that's
16:53
what we rely on with visualization is
16:54
short cutting messages into the brain
17:01
[Music]
17:10
we all hope that we will never find
17:13
ourselves a victim of all witness to a
17:16
crime
17:16
but if we were how confident are we that
17:20
we would correctly identify the
17:22
perpetrator or even remember accurately
17:25
exactly what happened my name is Graham
17:29
Pike I'm a professor of forensic
17:31
technician here at the open University's
17:33
Department of Psychology I teach and
17:36
research in the area of forensic
17:39
psychology of a particular expertise in
17:42
eyewitness memory eyewitness testimony
17:46
is a particularly problematic area for
17:50
several reasons one of those reasons is
17:52
the outcome of eyewitness testimony can
17:56
be very important so if an eyewitness
17:57
misidentify someone then an innocent
18:00
person can be sent to prison one of the
18:04
other problems with it is the difference
18:06
between everyday cognition so how our
18:09
brains work in everyday situations and
18:11
how they work in the very special
18:13
scenario of seeing a crime so we add
18:16
everyday experience for our mind works
18:18
is usually quite positive we recognize
18:20
our family and friends without any
18:21
problems
18:22
you know we remember what we're supposed
18:23
to be doing you know our memories tend
18:25
to work it's only remembering quite
18:27
difficult information we find
18:28
problematic but when it comes to a
18:30
situation where you've seen somebody
18:32
who's unfamiliar if only a few seconds
18:34
maybe in a very stressful situation in a
18:37
scenario that's very unfamiliar to you
18:39
then we're not so good at being able to
18:42
recognize that person in fact we're
18:44
particularly bad and we find it very
18:45
difficult to remember the events even
18:48
the order that they happened in can be
18:50
something really struggle with
18:52
so I'm missus tend to make a lot of
18:54
mistakes but importantly they don't
18:57
realize that they're making them testing
19:00
the reliability of eyewitness testimony
19:02
is actually quite difficult it's very
19:04
hard to replicate exactly the situation
19:07
that would happen in the court for
19:09
instance what we can't do is commit
19:12
really violent crimes in front of
19:14
research participants because it would
19:15
be unethical we also can't introduce
19:18
something called consequent she ality
19:20
now that refers to the consequences of a
19:23
decision that's taken so the
19:25
consequences in the court are really
19:27
profound what an eyewitness says can
19:29
lead to somebody be convicted to
19:31
somebody walking free even committed a
19:33
crime there's no way really of
19:34
replicating that in a research setting
19:37
[Music]
19:38
Grahame worked with the Greater
19:40
Manchester police on a fascinating
19:42
television series that explored the
19:45
issues around eyewitness behavior
19:47
through experiments and by staging
19:50
convincing mock crimes in front of a
19:52
group of volunteers the series called
19:56
eyewitness revealed some intriguing
19:59
insights into how our memories work and
20:02
some of the common errors that
20:04
eyewitnesses can make as a demonstration
20:08
of human memory we actually showed a
20:11
piece of kind of modern art to our
20:13
eyewitnesses and asked them to describe
20:15
it and ask them to say kind of what it
20:17
reminded them of could say it was fan
20:21
like in its shape like the spokes they
20:24
cohere like a bicycle wheel a few weeks
20:27
later we then got them to draw from
20:29
memory that piece of art and what we
20:32
found was that rather than replicate the
20:34
piece of art what the people tended to
20:36
do was replicate what they'd said it
20:39
looked like so if the person had said
20:41
well it kind of reminds me of a bicycle
20:43
wheel then what they drew was a bicycle
20:44
wheel so what they're done was
20:47
interpreted that piece of modern art as
20:49
what it reminded them of but then
20:50
remembered it in terms of that so not
20:54
exactly how it looked but what it
20:55
reminded them of and it was that that
20:57
they reproduce you've given the preacher
21:02
[Music]
21:12
the research being done by Graham and
21:15
his colleagues in this fascinating field
21:17
of study along with our growing
21:18
knowledge of how our memories work and
21:20
the use of modern technologies is
21:23
starting to offer very practical help to
21:26
those working in criminal investigation
21:28
dealing with eyewitnesses there were
21:32
some really good examples of Iowans
21:35
errors that were made in the eyewitness
21:37
series the second crime that we staged
21:41
was an armed robbery with most of the
21:43
people wearing ski masks so that you can
21:45
see any like bellick harvest you
21:47
couldn't really see anything their face
21:48
but there were eyes pie holster and one
21:50
of the eyewitnesses obviously remembered
21:52
that the eye region of the face was
21:54
somehow different and his brain
21:56
constructed a story to try to explain
21:59
that but rather than say the person was
22:01
wearing ski mask
22:02
he thought they're wearing sunglasses it
22:04
wasn't just the fact he said they were
22:05
wearing sunglasses which was completely
22:08
wrong he went into great detail about
22:10
what sunglasses looked like so he
22:11
described the brand
22:12
he described the the shape of the lenses
22:15
he described the the color of the bits
22:17
that go have your ears but all of that
22:19
information was completely made up his
22:22
brain had constructed and what was
22:23
really I guess surprising and really
22:25
illustrative of one of the problems
22:26
about his testimony is he completely
22:28
believed it for him the experiencer
22:30
remembering the sunglasses which didn't
22:32
exist was exactly the same as the
22:34
experience remembering details that did
22:36
exist my work and other research in
22:42
psychology really I think has two things
22:45
to offer the first is that we can act as
22:50
a warning to the criminal justice system
22:51
so that if we find that an eye witnesses
22:54
or eyewitnesses in general are unable to
22:56
do something or fairly inaccurate we can
22:59
warn them not to rely on that
23:00
information the other thing we can do is
23:02
by studying how the mind works and how
23:05
investigative procedures and courtroom
23:07
procedures kind of make the most of how
23:09
the mind works we can change those
23:12
procedures improve them so hopefully
23:15
what we can do is in
23:16
the accuracy of the information you
23:18
gained from an eyewitness to try and
23:21
stop an eyewitness identifying the wrong
23:23
person to try and help them remember
23:26
information more accurately more
23:28
completely one example of that are the
23:31
video identification parades that are
23:33
used in the UK
23:34
it used to be prior to 2003 that a
23:37
police officer would have to scour the
23:39
streets trying to find about nine or ten
23:41
people that looked just like the suspect
23:44
and that's a very hard thing to do and
23:46
we know that those parades tended to be
23:47
quite unfair and suspect with a video
23:50
identification system there's a very
23:52
large database of thousands of faces
23:53
that can be searched and you can put
23:56
together a parade based on that database
23:58
technology is also helping in terms of
24:01
what's known as facial composite images
24:04
so if it's and photo fits the original
24:07
systems such as the original photo fit
24:09
an identikit system were found by
24:11
psychologists to be very inaccurate
24:13
because they really didn't work in a way
24:16
that kind of made the most of human
24:18
cognition so the way we remember faces
24:20
is we remember the whole face we
24:23
remember it what's known as holistic Li
24:25
which means that the whole face but the
24:27
way those early systems worked was to
24:29
try to get people to construct a face by
24:31
picking out first of all the eyes and
24:34
then I know she'd look through hundreds
24:35
of eyes and try and pick the right one
24:36
now a memory just doesn't work like that
24:38
you you find it very hard to pick out
24:41
somebody a lot eyes particularly if you
24:42
don't know them well so modern systems
24:44
have been introduced computer systems
24:47
that are based on knowledge of how human
24:49
psychology operates so that now what you
24:52
see is a whole face and you kind of
24:55
create an image of the suspect by
24:58
manipulating the whole face so forensic
25:01
psychology is informing criminal justice
25:04
system and helping to improve police
25:06
investors give procedures all the time
25:10
you
25:14
[Music]
25:25
wherever you are in the world migration
25:28
is likely to be a hot topic
25:30
the influx into a country region or even
25:33
city of people from other nations or
25:36
cultures can cause anxiety distrust and
25:40
resentment in the communities where
25:42
migrants choose to settle and the
25:45
outflow of the educated and the young to
25:47
other regions or countries in search of
25:50
better lives can have serious
25:52
consequences for the homeland that they
25:54
leave behind and being that new arrival
25:57
in a strange place is always challenging
26:00
overcoming language barriers bridging
26:03
cultural gaps learning new rules both
26:06
written and unwritten and just trying to
26:09
fit in can be an exhausting and often
26:12
isolating experience but whatever your
26:15
views on the current politics of
26:17
migration there can be little doubt that
26:19
the movement of people is far from a new
26:21
phenomenon and the world as we know it
26:24
today would culturally be a much poorer
26:27
place if there had not been constant
26:30
movement of individuals and groups of
26:32
people between countries and cultures
26:34
throughout history our languages
26:38
religion food music art attitudes ideas
26:42
and customs have been shaped and
26:45
enriched by the mixing of cultures
26:47
brought about through migration
26:50
and ultimately migration is the sum
26:53
total of millions of individual
26:55
experiences and migrants who have
26:58
returned home often have unique
27:00
perspectives on the similarities and
27:02
differences between our culture's and
27:04
what we can learn from each other I
27:08
moved to China for a job and I lived
27:11
over about four years in general had a
27:13
very good experience I would say that my
27:16
two main challenges were learning
27:18
Mandarin and dealing with people's
27:22
expectations of me
27:23
most people obviously thought that I was
27:26
from China and so they would just make
27:32
natural assumptions they would they
27:33
would you know saw speaking to me in
27:34
Mandarin or or and things like that so
27:38
loads and loads of times I had to keep
27:40
saying to people no I'm not from China
27:42
I'm from Britain in terms of learning
27:46
Mandarin it was very difficult because
27:49
is a tonal language and if you don't get
27:52
the exact tone you could be saying
27:55
something completely different so
27:57
sometimes for example were often when I
28:00
spend two taxi drivers and I would say
28:02
my address they wouldn't understand me
28:04
because of the tone so I would have to
28:07
keep adjusting my tone all the time and
28:08
so sometimes it would take at least four
28:12
attempts to get my address right in the
28:15
end though I decided that the easiest
28:18
thing to do would be to carry my address
28:20
around with me written in Chinese so
28:24
that I could just show it to the taxi
28:25
driver the other thing of course about
28:28
Mandarin was of course reading and
28:30
writing it I couldn't read or write it
28:33
even though my parents who are from Hong
28:38
Kong tried to teach me when I was very
28:40
young and that is one of my regrets so
28:43
that was one of my regrets when I was
28:44
living in China I kind of thought to
28:45
myself a few times I wish I'd paid more
28:48
attention and when I was younger when my
28:50
parents were trying to teach me I've
28:52
lived in Turkey
28:53
I've lived in Colombia in Bogota the
28:56
capital and I've also lived in
28:58
Kazakhstan as well so I suppose
29:00
different regions completely
29:02
geographically
29:03
but I don't think that really changed
29:06
the people that were there one thing I
29:08
found was actually inherently all people
29:11
they're all the same I don't want to
29:13
make that sound very general but their
29:15
values are very similar their approach
29:17
to life is very similar how they work
29:20
within their family is very very similar
29:23
small things may be how they do things
29:26
on a day-to-day basis foods that they
29:29
eat what they do within a family what
29:31
their typical Friday night is what their
29:33
typical so evening with activities are
29:36
may of course differ but inherently I
29:38
think they're actually really similar
29:40
when I was in Turkey my push was always
29:44
to mix as much as possible with local
29:48
people a funder learnt a lot more I
29:51
integrated a lot better and actually
29:53
that was the best way to pick up the
29:54
language so within two years in Turkey
29:57
for example I was actually able to
29:59
translate documents for colleagues from
30:00
Turkish to English and vice versa one
30:04
thing I found in Turkey it doesn't
30:06
matter when you're working when you're
30:08
free it's important to sit down at least
30:11
once a day as a family together and eat
30:14
the same thing so not one person has to
30:16
have their diet the other person has
30:18
their dad it's a collective something
30:20
communal which I really believe brings
30:22
the families together and that's
30:23
something that I insist now when I'm
30:25
sitting with my family as well moving to
30:28
Brazil was just it was again a complete
30:30
culture shock but the weather was
30:32
incredible people were very friendly and
30:35
the food was amazing and I left by the
30:37
beach it was like I'd landed in heaven
30:40
and and I just didn't I didn't know how
30:43
it happened and because I had Spanish
30:46
Portuguese was a little bit easier it
30:48
was more accessible I could kind of get
30:50
by and I just loved every minute of
30:53
being in Brazil I just loved the food
30:56
the lifestyle the people and it was an
31:00
amazing experience I think in Brazil
31:03
what you learn to do is you learn to
31:04
value the the things that are good in
31:08
your life
31:09
right now there's a lot of poverty in
31:10
Brazil and what I learned is you look at
31:13
the window sometimes and people are
31:15
playing these
31:15
in the street and you see people dancing
31:17
and they haven't got a loss but they
31:19
were just enjoying the moment so I guess
31:21
for me one of the the biggest things
31:23
that I learned is you've just got to
31:25
enjoy the moment and seize it
31:30
[Music]
31:40
some people who migrate never return to
31:43
live in their homeland what is the
31:46
experience like for them I moved to the
31:50
UK in 2015 years ago from India I was
31:55
born and bred in South India in a place
31:58
called Kerala lovely place I came here
32:01
to do my degree
32:02
and my grandmother lived on her own here
32:06
so to live with her as well when I was
32:09
doing my degree the first year or so
32:12
when you're sort of integrating yourself
32:14
and learning more about the culture and
32:17
all that trying to understand the
32:19
accents I did feel a little bit foreign
32:22
because in my first assignment I did law
32:25
degree first assignment was to watch a
32:27
trial in a courtroom and the guy had an
32:30
Irish accent and I had to take notes I
32:32
came back with a blank page a nurse
32:34
having a big I'm sorry I didn't
32:37
understand that Indian culture is very
32:40
very conservative in the sense that you
32:44
don't have as much freedom of expression
32:47
everything is set in their ways and
32:50
there is a certain path you follow so
32:53
you go to school you go to university
32:56
you get a degree you get a job then you
32:58
do your masters then it's all like that
33:01
that's the way it is most people do and
33:04
you kind of tend to fall into it
33:06
whereas what I found here was people
33:09
were not afraid to choose a slightly
33:13
different path okay what if I don't do a
33:15
degree doesn't matter I can go and work
33:17
for five years and then go back into
33:19
education say 15 years later doesn't
33:22
matter when you do it when I came to do
33:26
my degree my plan was always to go back
33:29
in four years time and you know get a
33:31
good job and settle no my parents are
33:34
because they were back in India and then
33:37
I got married for a while not a
33:40
non-straight after
33:42
I got a job here in London so I started
33:46
working and then I met somebody and then
33:48
he happened to be from here and we got
33:50
married and that's rest is history now
33:54
it's very hard when you're living in a
33:57
different country and if you have a
33:59
different set of values and culture you
34:00
grew up with to keep it intact it's very
34:02
difficult but I do strive to do that in
34:06
terms of like in Indian culture family
34:09
structure is very its family is very
34:11
important I'm sure family's important
34:13
for everyone but when your parents age
34:16
it kind of considered your
34:19
responsibility to look after them and I
34:21
think that's a nice sort of thing to
34:22
keep and there are elements like that
34:25
that I I do miss sometimes I don't get
34:29
to do as much as I would like to but I
34:31
do as much as I can I try to think about
34:34
it every evening my everyday actions and
34:36
try to sort of bring it into my life I
34:39
do still think of India as home I think
34:42
that's because it's 16 years is a long
34:45
time and where you grew up where you
34:47
have your childhood all that that kind
34:49
of comes to be the home so I did think
34:53
of it as home although if I'm away from
34:55
here for more than two weeks I get
34:58
homesick so I can say I have two homes
35:01
maybe for me it's interesting because I
35:05
was born in England and my mother was
35:08
Irish so she did exactly what I'm doing
35:11
now in that she moved to England in 1984
35:16
always intended to move back but didn't
35:19
move back until 1997 so stay there for
35:23
quite a long time but did make the move
35:26
back personally I always imagined that I
35:29
moved back it's home I suppose but the
35:33
reason I moved was mainly economic it's
35:37
very difficult to get the kind of job I
35:40
have now in a Ireland so the reality is
35:44
that Ireland can't offer the same
35:46
variety that a bigger country
35:49
can offer and no matter how economically
35:51
successful it is that will always be the
35:55
case it's a country of 4 and a half
35:57
million people emigration is a part of
36:01
Irish culture it's in our literature now
36:05
famous songs and it's something people
36:09
talk about a lot there's a famous quote
36:13
about you know no longer shall our
36:15
children be raised like our cattle for
36:19
export that's a paraphrase but that is
36:24
essentially what happened for the last
36:27
century at least yet being Irish is a
36:30
strange one because it's a small country
36:32
that has a big brand a lot of people
36:37
know something about Ireland even if
36:39
they know very little about the actual
36:41
country you're the first thing you'll
36:44
hear is usually the Irish pub then you
36:48
might hear something about singing and
36:51
then you might hear footballers like Roy
36:54
Keane or Robbie Keane so when an Irish
36:58
person goes abroad they're usually met
37:00
with this brand and in a way it's a good
37:03
thing people tend to warm to you quickly
37:07
but that can also be difficult because
37:09
people have a cartoonish view of Ireland
37:13
which has little or nothing to do with
37:16
the reality so often you're you have to
37:21
break through the cartoon like identity
37:26
to actually communicate what being Irish
37:31
is
37:36
[Music]
37:46
in any conflicts knowledge is power
37:50
being able to communicate effectively
37:52
and secretly with allies is always a
37:56
challenge and codes ciphers and code
37:59
breakers have played a vital role in
38:01
every conflict in history it's
38:04
unsurprising to know therefore that
38:06
during World War two some of the
38:08
greatest minds of a generation were
38:10
engaged in cracking the codes of enemy
38:13
communications being transmitted around
38:15
the world but it's the lasting legacy of
38:18
some of this work that is surprising
38:23
this is Bletchley Park in the center of
38:26
England today it's open to the public
38:29
and is very popular with visitors but
38:32
during the Second World War this was one
38:34
of the most secretive places in the
38:36
country and the base of the government
38:39
code and cypher school the people who
38:42
worked here broadly came from virtually
38:45
everywhere but more specifically many of
38:48
them came from the major universities
38:51
they had them on standby and the idea
38:55
was that they would come in for courses
38:57
and that sort of thing one of the
38:59
earliest people approach will have been
39:01
Alan Turing who was freshly back from
39:04
the USA where he just spent two years at
39:06
Princeton University and the courses
39:10
would generally be toned for the
39:12
university of vacations so then they
39:15
could still do their University work but
39:17
trained as potential code breakers this
39:22
is the Enigma machine the most famous
39:25
wartime cipher machine in history using
39:29
mechanical wheel settings to encrypt
39:31
messages that were then sent via Morse
39:33
code the machine was first developed in
39:36
Germany at the end of the first world
39:38
war
39:40
at Bletchley Park mathematicians Alan
39:43
Turing and Gordon welchman developed the
39:45
form this electromechanical device
39:48
enabled the testing of all the possible
39:51
settings of the Enigma machine to be
39:53
done mechanically in high volumes and
39:56
quickly by 1941 there were rooms full of
40:01
these machines standing nearly 2 meters
40:04
tall and 2 meters wide and whilst our
40:07
insuring was the man who was an absolute
40:10
genius in coming up with the technical
40:13
ideas it was Gordon welchman who said we
40:17
need to mechanize not just that bit but
40:20
the whole process overall and have a
40:22
complete production line for
40:24
intelligence and so type X was designed
40:27
it was a bigger machine it was a better
40:29
machine than enigma it had five rotor
40:32
wheels in each Maroney had three it
40:34
could produce a paper tape from the side
40:36
far easier to use and so they took these
40:39
type X machines and they effectively
40:42
reverse engineered them and they made
40:44
them as clones of enigma so having got
40:47
the settings the next machine you use
40:49
now is the type X machine to effectively
40:52
type the message out you put in the
40:54
gobbledygook and the tape on the side
40:56
produces the German the deciphered
41:01
messages were sent between Hut's at
41:03
Bletchley for translation and analysis
41:05
and then turned into intelligence
41:08
reports for security reasons the huts
41:11
were only known by their numbers and no
41:14
one spoke of the work they were doing
41:16
inside their heart the conditions here
41:21
were by modern office standards
41:24
rudimentary I think there was a high
41:27
degree of camaraderie lots of friends
41:30
were made but at the same time overall
41:33
an overriding was security so your best
41:37
friend could work in the next-door
41:39
office to you but you wouldn't dream of
41:42
talking to him or her about what they
41:44
were doing
41:48
[Music]
41:59
breaking enigma is one of the most
42:01
famous achievements of the team at
42:03
Bletchley but it was the work done on
42:06
another cipher machine that Lorenz that
42:09
really laid the groundwork for
42:10
modern-day computing some of the
42:13
machines that were created to decipher
42:15
Lorenz have been rebuilt and can be seen
42:18
working to this day at the National
42:20
Museum of computing at Bletchley Park
42:23
enigma machines were used in the field
42:26
to create secure everyday communications
42:30
but the Lorenz was a much more complex
42:33
cipher machine which was used for
42:35
high-level strategic communications
42:39
British intelligence had no idea what
42:42
the Lorenz machine looked like or how it
42:44
worked and knew that the intelligence
42:48
value of breaking this code would be
42:50
immense and some of Bletchley --zz most
42:53
brilliant minds were dedicated to the
42:55
task buildups was perhaps the most
42:58
brilliant of them all all tuck needed
43:02
was a simple mistake to be made by a
43:04
Lorenz operator
43:07
in August 1941 messages test messages
43:14
sent by the German setting up a new link
43:18
between Vienna and Athens were
43:22
intercepted it was due to operator error
43:25
that the message was sent twice both
43:29
copies were received by Bletchley
43:31
because of operator error the copies
43:33
were different and the head of the
43:38
military section Colonel tilts man over
43:41
a few days broke the message well
43:44
breaking one message sent twice is not
43:46
the answer to the solution so he then
43:49
passed it to the research section and
43:52
said this is what I've done so far now
43:54
tell me how the machine works and they
43:58
kicked it around for a couple of weeks
43:59
and then one day captain Jerry Morgan
44:03
called him bill Tut
44:04
hands him a sheaf of paper and gives him
44:07
some really comprehensive instructions
44:09
see what you can do with this and tuck
44:13
then took it away and over a period of a
44:15
few weeks analyzed the complete
44:19
architecture of the machine TAS feat was
44:23
said to be the single biggest
44:26
intellectual feat of the second world
44:28
war with tarts plans and the help of
44:32
another great mathematician max Newman
44:34
the Heath Robinson machine was built to
44:37
find the settings for the Lorenz
44:39
machines the Heath Robinson was an
44:43
electronic machine but required tele
44:45
print paper tapes to run simultaneously
44:48
one for input and one for output the
44:53
paper stretched and snapped and the
44:56
process was inefficient breaking the
44:59
Lorenz messages still took weeks
45:03
improvements needed to be made and Tommy
45:06
flowers was the man to help flowers was
45:10
an electronics engineer who worked for
45:12
the post office his genius was finding a
45:15
way to replace the paper tape input with
45:18
electronic valves
45:20
the end result of this innovation was
45:23
Colossus the world's first large-scale
45:26
electronic digital computer while
45:30
extremely limited by modern-day
45:32
standards this was a monumental
45:34
breakthrough and reduced the time taken
45:37
to break Lorenz messages from weeks to
45:39
hours the sheer size of Colossus is
45:44
incredible by the end of the war there
45:46
were 10 Colossus machines at Bletchley
45:49
all being operated by female staff and
45:52
the intelligence gathered using these
45:55
machines was absolutely pivotal in the
45:57
war effort so why don't more people know
46:02
about Colossus and about the genius of
46:05
max Newman built ups and Tommy flowers
46:08
so much of the progress made in the area
46:11
of computing during the 1940s was simply
46:15
lost at the end of the war with the Cold
46:19
War looming the British never revealed
46:21
that enigma and Lorenz had been broken
46:24
people never spoke of their time at
46:26
Bletchley papers and plans were burned
46:29
machines destroyed and progressed
46:32
stalled for many years the great minds
46:37
who had worked together at Bletchley
46:39
were scattered back to universities in
46:41
the UK and around the world and Tommy
46:44
flowers returned to the post office for
46:47
decades this groundbreaking work
46:50
remained secret and unrecognized
46:52
it wasn't until 1975 that the first
46:56
information emerged about the existence
46:58
of Colossus and it took another 30 years
47:01
before the machine could be rebuilt
47:05
it's impossible now to imagine how
47:08
different the history of computing might
47:10
have been if the veil of secrecy had
47:12
been lifted in 1945 and these great
47:15
minds had continued to work together
47:18
[Music]
47:32
graffiti gets a bad rap but in some
47:36
areas this negative perception is being
47:39
turned on its head graffiti and street
47:42
art is bringing communities back to life
47:46
it's turning dour and uninteresting
47:49
streets into exciting vibrant places to
47:52
live and work rafi tea is providing a
47:55
creative outlet for young and old alike
47:58
its opening eyes creating new
48:01
opportunities and making people happy
48:05
David speed is a graffiti artist and the
48:08
director of graffiti life an
48:11
organization whose work shows that you
48:14
don't have to sell a Banksy to have
48:15
graffiti change your life
48:18
graffiti life is a collective of artists
48:20
we offer a range of services to our
48:23
clients so as well as having our little
48:25
gallery here where we sell prints and
48:27
original paintings we also do team
48:30
building where we teach people how to
48:32
paint they can sort of learn how to do
48:34
graffiti we do murals we've worked for
48:37
some really big companies we do
48:39
advertising and we paint interiors
48:42
exteriors murals all over the world
48:46
which is great and we also do live art
48:49
so we're we're sort panting at an event
48:50
and everyone can watch the artwork
48:53
coming together david is well aware of
48:56
the negative attitudes towards some
48:58
graffiti the vandalism side of graffiti
49:00
certainly does still exist and there are
49:03
people that their sole aim is to become
49:07
famous through through their peers
49:10
really it's not really on a wider scale
49:12
just just within the graffiti community
49:15
they want to become well known so they
49:17
will then paint their name on as many
49:19
surfaces as possible that's kind of
49:21
their goal and that still very much
49:24
exists it's it's kind of funny how
49:28
there's sort of two different worlds
49:30
within it there's there's the people who
49:32
are just there's a lot of people who are
49:34
strictly just painting legally there are
49:36
people who are painting legally and
49:38
illegally and then there are the people
49:40
who were strictly painting illegally and
49:42
they the two worlds both still exist the
49:46
reason that I'm allowed to work
49:49
professionally as a graffiti artist
49:50
nowadays comes down to the fact that
49:54
there is an understanding from the
49:57
general public of the artistic side of
49:59
graffiti I think a lot of that can be
50:02
attributed to Banksy than these really
50:05
sort of clever messages that he was
50:08
saying and quite ironic and satirical
50:10
and things like that
50:11
and I think that was the catalyst for
50:16
people to to
50:17
understand this art form a little bit
50:20
more and that was maybe the easy way
50:23
into okay well I've seen this guy Banksy
50:26
but let me see who else is out there and
50:29
I don't think there would be a graffiti
50:31
life if there hadn't been a Banksy
50:34
beforehand because it's sort of opened a
50:37
lot of doors because people are now a
50:39
lot more understanding of the artwork
50:42
that we make the graffiti live gallery
50:45
is in the heart of the East End an area
50:48
that is now internationally famous for
50:50
its Street out for me I just love the
50:55
fact that I mean I live in East London
50:57
so every day when I walk to work I get
51:00
to go to an art gallery completely for
51:02
free I'm walking past new pieces it's
51:05
forever changing it's constantly
51:07
updating itself every time I go past the
51:11
wall there's something new on it and I
51:13
love that kind of freshness people come
51:15
from across the world to come to East
51:17
London just to see the street art we run
51:19
street art tours where we take people
51:21
around this area or and tell them bits
51:23
about the artists that have created this
51:25
work and on this in the same way artists
51:29
international artists this would be
51:31
their first stop is to come to London to
51:34
create art work here just because this
51:36
this is the harbour this is central
51:38
place where this is where the all the
51:39
art work happens
51:40
certainly with industry are
51:46
[Music]
51:58
so what is it about graffiti that David
52:01
loves and wants to share with others so
52:04
for me it's more about I just enjoy
52:08
seeing people expressing themselves like
52:11
when we do workshops with people you can
52:14
see that when it kind of grabs them and
52:17
people get to do this themselves and the
52:19
pride that they have when they've
52:21
created something amazing on this huge
52:23
scale much bigger than they've ever
52:25
painted before because maybe the biggest
52:27
they've ever painted before is sort of
52:28
on a canvas or or just on a piece of a4
52:31
paper or something like that and then
52:33
all of a sudden you're painting a huge
52:34
wall and you just have this this sense
52:36
of achievement of what you've created
52:38
and I love that I love I love the
52:40
expression and the kind of the fact that
52:43
there really are no rules I mean you can
52:46
you can paint whatever you like and
52:48
that's there are so many people just
52:50
painting what appeals to them and I
52:53
think if you just paint what appeals to
52:55
you then though you will find a lot of
52:57
people that it appeals to as well a lot
53:00
of times when we work with young people
53:01
you find you get I mean in every group
53:05
no matter what age they are you always
53:07
get someone who says I can't even draw a
53:10
stickman and they're the people that I
53:13
really love kind of working with because
53:15
I only need 90 minutes and where the
53:19
person who says I can't draw I have no
53:21
artistic talent give me 90 minutes with
53:24
that person they'll be so proud of what
53:25
they've created at the end of it I love
53:27
that and we can really sort of turn that
53:30
on its head and a lot of young people
53:33
that we work with maybe they're not that
53:36
confident we've worked with a lot of
53:38
people who are kind of not in education
53:40
or or training so they're they're
53:42
unemployed they've kind of maybe not
53:45
been given a lot of opportunities or
53:48
they've kind of been passed by by
53:51
society or in school kind of they
53:53
weren't really working well at academic
53:55
subjects and that wasn't kind of what
53:57
they were strongest at
53:59
I often find with when I'm working with
54:01
young people
54:02
I'll give them a compliment on what
54:04
they're doing your girl that's wicked
54:06
what you've just done that's really cool
54:08
what you've just created and they sort
54:10
of look at you like like blow they've
54:12
never heard a compliment before and I
54:13
just think there's so many young people
54:16
who are not being encouraged enough and
54:18
and maybe their schoolwork and stuff
54:23
they find it really hard or they find
54:24
maths hard or something like that but if
54:26
you give them artistic something
54:28
artistic where it's kind of an open
54:30
playing field if I've got a group of
54:32
young people who've never painted before
54:34
they're all at the set roughly at the
54:37
same skill level and so they can produce
54:40
something they could be really be proud
54:41
of and you just see that kind of
54:43
transformation in people I think
54:45
graffiti is a really powerful tool and I
54:47
think it can bring communities together
54:49
I think that when community is involved
54:54
in creating a piece of artwork then they
54:57
have ownership of that work and they've
54:59
become fiercely proud of it and
55:01
protective of it
55:03
I mean sometimes in the past not so much
55:07
over over more recent years but
55:08
sometimes in the past we'd be we'd be
55:11
going up to a wall and we'd have our get
55:13
our spray cans out and lay them out on
55:15
the floor just ready to paint and you'd
55:17
have people muttering under their breath
55:19
something about graffiti or messy or
55:21
you're about to ruin this wall or what
55:23
not but then as soon as you started
55:25
painting those same people are walking
55:27
by and I mean the amount of sort of
55:29
older people the older generation who
55:31
maybe you would expect to not be
55:34
interested in what we're doing or or
55:36
particularly inspired by what we're
55:38
doing I was amazed initially for how
55:41
many of those people were coming over
55:43
and going what you are doing is
55:44
fantastic and we love it and that's I
55:46
mean that's happened so many times and I
55:50
think that's that's just so amazing that
55:53
people were sort of walking by an egg
55:55
and they're getting involved in they're
55:57
saying no we really approve of what
55:59
you're doing for me I want to survive my
56:02
goal and graffiti life's goal on the
56:05
whole is is to create artwork everywhere
56:09
so we're happiest when we can
56:12
walk down the street and we can see
56:13
amazing artwork everywhere and I think
56:17
that like as I'm traveling I would much
56:20
rather see creative stuff on the walls
56:23
wherever I go rather than just kind of
56:26
plain blank painted by the council gray
56:29
walls I think that's kind of stifling
56:34
and I think people should be encouraged
56:35
to be creative
56:40
[Music]
56:49
my name is spun leader truth Shackleton
56:52
and I am presently the team manager for
56:54
the Royal Air Force aerobatic team the
56:57
red arrows the red arrows is the most
57:00
famous display team in the world the
57:02
full title is the Royal Air Force
57:03
aerobatic team it was founded in 1964
57:07
and it was a culmination of three
57:09
different display teams the team as a
57:12
whole consists of 120 personnel and that
57:16
is made up of nine display pilots a
57:18
commentator photographers logisticians
57:21
engineers administrators and we are
57:25
fairly self contained in order so that
57:27
we can perform in over 10 countries
57:30
around the world each year our display
57:34
season begins in May and it continues to
57:37
October predominantly our displays are
57:40
in the United Kingdom however we do do
57:43
tours abroad and in 2013 we turds 10
57:47
countries throughout the Middle East in
57:49
the period of 35 days
57:54
the displays are a series of formations
57:57
and maneuvers
57:58
that's last in the region of 20 minutes
58:01
the first half of a display is sweeping
58:04
formations made up of nine aircraft the
58:07
second half of the display is a lot more
58:09
dynamic and a lot more fast-paced and
58:11
that's where you'll get the sink repair
58:14
and the mid-air maneuvers that you
58:16
almost think they're going to touch and
58:18
we are famous for the display people try
58:22
and replicate us throughout the world
58:25
the pilots are indeed the very finest
58:28
pilots that the Royal Air Force have
58:30
there is very few people that could fly
58:33
in such close proximity at such high
58:36
speeds and so they are extremely
58:38
professional in what they do and it
58:40
takes an awful lot of practice and
58:42
dedication to get to that level the jet
58:45
they've generally been in the Air Force
58:47
up to 11 to 12 years they have had to
58:50
have flown 1,500 fast jet flying hours
58:53
they have to be above average which
58:55
sounds very ordinary but I can assure
58:57
you that it's the very best we have my
59:01
role on in the red areas is that I'm the
59:03
team manager that involves me being
59:07
responsible for everything non flying
59:09
related so if you can envisage moving of
59:12
display team of this size around both
59:15
the UK and abroad it takes an awful lot
59:17
of logistics and coordination that is
59:20
one of my roles
59:21
I am also responsible for the marketing
59:23
and PR aspects of the team and I also
59:27
the corporate liaison for all our
59:30
corporate sponsors it is a very broad
59:34
role no two days are the same
59:36
some days I might be speaking to the
59:38
royal household other days I'm speaking
59:40
to schoolchildren it is from the
59:43
strategic to the operations of the
59:44
tactical levels and it's a huge very
59:48
very demanding role and I'm very little
59:51
bit privileged to be able to do it many
59:54
people would want to be in the role I
59:57
mean I take it extremely seriously and I
60:00
think it's a great honor to both
60:01
represent my country at the Royal Air
60:04
Force and to be part of such a famous
60:06
that is renowned throughout the world
60:09
and no matter what gender what race what
60:12
nationality people have heard of the red
60:15
arrows and it's rather like a red London
60:17
bus or it's rather like Queen we're a
60:20
British institution and to be the team
60:22
manager for that institution is a
60:24
once-in-a-lifetime
60:29
I suppose my career to date has been
60:41
quite unusual in terms of my gender
60:44
because I've normally taken on roles
60:46
normally associated with men
60:48
however it's not preclude including me
60:51
from doing anything my first role was as
60:53
a flight attendant with an airline which
60:55
of course is very female orientated but
60:58
I decided at the age of 24 that I'd like
61:00
to join the Royal Air Force it's about
61:03
10% of the Air Force is female and you
61:07
are included in everything and so
61:09
despite people's thoughts on the
61:12
military it's a very equal and fair
61:16
employer and as such I've done many
61:20
roles that men normally do I suppose I
61:23
was a bit of a tomboy whilst growing up
61:25
I liked cars I like Lego I liked
61:28
everything associated with boys but no I
61:32
joined the combined cadet force when I
61:35
was 16 as part of the Royal Air Force
61:38
cadets and that was pretty unusual I was
61:40
the first female cadet at my school to
61:42
do that
61:43
and it was a really interesting exciting
61:46
challenge not only did we get to fly and
61:49
do aerobatics but we did a lot of field
61:52
crafts too and that really exposed me to
61:54
the military for the first time I became
61:58
a flight attendant really truly because
62:01
I wanted to travel and explore the world
62:03
and get into the world of work my
62:05
friends had all gone to university
62:07
intent on pursuing a further academic
62:09
study I knew that was not for me and I
62:13
wanted to explore and do something very
62:15
different so I ended up working for a
62:18
Middle Eastern airline which exposed me
62:20
to extremely different culture of course
62:22
very different between the genders in
62:24
that part of the world I absolutely
62:26
loved
62:27
and I had a marvelous time exploring
62:30
over 2000 hours flying in over three
62:32
years my lifestyle differs from that of
62:36
my friends and colleagues in that's by
62:40
my age normally you're settling down to
62:42
have a family
62:43
your maybes becoming a bit more stable
62:45
you're settling in the one region an
62:47
area of course my job I've moved 13
62:51
times in as many years and each job has
62:54
been very different in a different part
62:56
of the country or the world and so
62:58
you're rather like a hobo
63:00
you're like a rolling stone and you
63:02
never quite know where your next role is
63:05
going to be this is particularly
63:07
prevalent in this role because we do a
63:11
lot of displays all around the country
63:13
and around the world and it necessitates
63:15
me being the team manager to arrange
63:17
that for the team so it is up on the
63:20
road a great deal I go to a lot of
63:23
meetings all over the country and when
63:25
we go on tour I'm in the thick of it
63:27
arranging that - so you've sleep in a
63:31
lot of different beds and hotels you
63:34
meet an awful lot of different people
63:35
and I guess it's very much career
63:39
orientated my lifestyle as opposed to
63:41
some who've chosen to stay at home
63:43
I don't truly feel that there should be
63:46
gender orientation in the job role you
63:49
choose
63:49
I believe male and females have equally
63:53
as many strengths and weaknesses I feel
63:56
if you're determined enough and you work
63:58
hard enough and you set your mind to
64:00
something bad enough I think you can
64:03
achieve almost anything I never dreamt
64:05
that when I started as a flight
64:07
attendant with an airline it had to end
64:09
up being the team manager for the most
64:11
famous display team in the world I've
64:14
never experienced any negative attitudes
64:16
towards me in the roles I've chosen
64:18
I've always been taken as an equal it is
64:22
a male orientated world certainly in the
64:25
military but that's only spurred beyond
64:27
and challenged me further because I
64:30
believe that women are equally talented
64:33
and can perform equally well in these
64:36
roles but you have to want it bad enough
64:38
and you really got to do the business
64:41
it's not always easy because sometimes
64:43
you face challenges it's uncomfortable
64:45
your private life suffers your home life
64:47
you know it's tiring you're in dangerous
64:50
situations potentially but you only got
64:55
one shot at life and you got to live it
64:56
and that's always been the way I've
64:59
tried to live my life
65:03
[Music]
65:13
on a summer's evening in London a crowd
65:16
is gathering for an unusual cinematic
65:19
experience this is the Kennington
65:22
Bioscope a unique monthly event that
65:25
takes place in the historic old Lambeth
65:28
workhouse where Charlie Chaplin lived
65:30
and worked before he went on to become
65:32
cinemas first international superstar
65:35
it is now the location of the cinema
65:38
Museum the Bioscope gives its audience
65:42
the chance to travel back to a time
65:43
before multiplex cinemas IMAX 3d and
65:47
ear-splitting surround sound to
65:50
experience long-forgotten silent films
65:52
shown with live piano a compliment just
65:55
as they would have been enjoyed a
65:57
hundred years ago
66:00
John Sweeney is a world-renowned silent
66:03
film accompanist co-founder of the event
66:06
and expert on the silent film era the
66:10
characteristic of silent film is that
66:11
there is no real sound on the picture
66:14
you might have a soundtrack put on it at
66:17
some point either at the time or later
66:19
but there is no real sound you don't
66:21
have the sound of talking you don't have
66:22
the sound of dogs barking your doors
66:24
closing or cars revving up or anything
66:26
like that
66:26
of course calling it silent film is a
66:29
misnomer right from the beginning of
66:32
cinema in 1895 people use music to fill
66:36
the gaps left by not having real sound
66:41
by the twenties quite often productions
66:44
would have a score which was written if
66:47
it was a particularly liked big-budget
66:49
sort of production number they would
66:52
have commissioned to score which way
66:54
would possibly expect to be played
66:56
everywhere but whether it was I don't
66:58
know other times the musical director of
67:01
the production company would produce
67:04
what's known as cue sheets which is a
67:06
list of popular tunes or tunes from big
67:09
books of music for silent film and they
67:11
would say play for this scene play this
67:13
number for the scene play another piece
67:15
and some one or so on there are some
67:17
people who think you should watch son at
67:18
film and silence to get the purest
67:20
cinematic experience which is all very
67:22
well it's it the vast majority of silent
67:25
films in my opinion don't work in
67:27
silence
67:27
and certainly the vast majority of
67:29
silent films we've never made to be seen
67:31
in silence the directors didn't expect
67:33
them to be seen in silent iver so there
67:37
is a space for the music the music is
67:38
essential it's very interesting with
67:40
someone like Alfred Hitchcock who's nine
67:43
surviving silent films have recently
67:45
been restored beautifully about the
67:47
British Film Institute if you look at
67:50
his silent films when you look at the
67:51
sound films you can see that he grew up
67:53
being a silent film director because
67:55
there are so many scenes in Hitchcock
67:57
which aren't about dialogue at all and
68:00
where the music is as action happening
68:02
and the music is happening or in the
68:05
case of for example of a crop for crop
68:07
duster scene in North by Northwest there
68:09
isn't even any music that you have a
68:11
real sound but there's no dialogue and
68:16
you can see that he grew up making film
68:19
by image and he said show don't tell
68:21
that was one of his catchphrases the
68:25
release of the first official talking
68:27
picture the jazz singer in 1927 signaled
68:30
the beginning of the end of the silent
68:32
film era Hollywood only continued making
68:35
silent films for another couple of years
68:37
but in other countries the tradition
68:40
persisted
68:42
in other countries there in Japan for
68:44
example they were making silent films as
68:45
late as 1935-36 and also in Russia so it
68:49
varies but basically the end of the
68:51
twenties was the end of a silent era
68:52
so when talkies came in and took a while
68:55
for all the cinemas to switch over to
68:56
sound but the writing was on the wall
68:58
the silent film I can't really the
69:01
figure but I think at least two-thirds
69:02
of the films made in the Sun era were
69:04
lost either through neglect because when
69:08
sound came in people thought maybe we
69:09
interested any more silent films were
69:12
also made on a film stock made out of
69:14
silver nitrate so they were often boiled
69:16
up to get the silver content and the
69:20
film is fragile so lots of films just
69:21
decayed
69:26
[Music]
69:36
people always save it sign up for music
69:37
kind of go
69:38
[Music]
69:46
and of course sometimes it does but I
69:48
think people's image of Simon film is so
69:51
much derived from two things - from
69:53
slapstick comedy from the Buster Keaton
69:55
and the Harold Lloyd and the Chaplin
69:57
shorts which we're familiar with and the
70:00
other thing is from German Expressionism
70:01
a silent film was so so much broader
70:04
than this when I got into silent film I
70:06
had the same thought but that was
70:07
basically silent film but then I
70:09
discovered this huge range of material
70:12
music can do a number of things for the
70:14
audience sometimes it reflects the speed
70:17
of the action but more often it helps
70:19
the audience to see inside the heads of
70:21
the characters it allows them to
70:24
understand what a character is feeling
70:26
music can shape our emotional response
70:29
to the scene and character
70:33
the most simple way of putting it is
70:35
major is hat and major key as a happy
70:37
key bets
70:39
it's a happy key and a minor the sad key
70:45
but of course that's simplifying to a
70:48
ridiculous extent you can have very very
70:51
sad music which is in a major key you
70:54
can come very wistful music in a major
70:55
key
70:56
[Music]
71:06
so it's other factors other factors like
71:11
the rhythm all that sort of thing where
71:14
the music is going how that's building
71:16
how it's shaping have a huge influence
71:18
on um on the move that you're creating
71:22
when I pay for a film my idea of what
71:26
I'm trying to achieve is summed up by a
71:27
great composer of music for sound film
71:30
actually Elmer Bernstein who said he
71:32
tried to find the heartbeat of the film
71:35
quite often I'm paying for a film I
71:37
haven't seen probably more than 50% of a
71:40
time I think and that's hard you spend
71:43
the first part of the film even if you
71:44
know a little bit about it of course you
71:45
read up as much as you can to find out
71:47
about it but you spend the first bit of
71:49
a film feeling for the characters and
71:51
what's going on then if you're lucky you
71:54
can kind of lock in on what the director
71:57
and the actors are trying to achieve in
71:58
the film and what what the characters
72:00
are feeling and then it somehow becomes
72:03
easier and you get into the swing of the
72:05
film and the rhythm of the film makes
72:06
sense to you
72:07
other times you feel like you can't
72:10
quite get in there and you're often on
72:11
the outside and you can be doing the
72:13
right sort of music but you somehow
72:15
haven't got the rhythm of the film and
72:16
the end and they're shaping it in terms
72:18
of where it's building up to and so
72:20
forth in an ideal world when I'm paying
72:24
for a silent film
72:25
I shouldn't really be aware of what I'm
72:28
playing at all it's happened sometimes
72:29
when I've got so swept up in the film
72:31
then it's just the music has kind of
72:33
pull it out of me as a response to what
72:35
I'm seeing on the screen and I haven't
72:38
had to think about it I mean one thing I
72:41
say we're not when I'm teaching your
72:43
master classes something worth it's not
72:46
always the case but something that's
72:47
worth thinking about when you're playing
72:48
for a scene is what are people's heart
72:49
beats doing this scene you know I've I
72:51
am it is it a scene where that the
72:54
tension is building up you know
72:55
[Music]
73:06
or are they
73:09
[Music]
73:20
and so on
73:21
you know this there's a whole range of
73:24
how you respond to what's happening on
73:26
screen it but in a way you have to kind
73:29
of be inside the characters I feel
73:31
that's my approach in it that's how I
73:34
feel what works when I can get inside
73:35
the characters most people assume that
73:38
the audience's at silent film screenings
73:40
today will be filled with older people
73:43
and film buffs but increasingly the
73:47
audiences are filling with younger
73:48
people with a newfound interest in the
73:51
artistry of these early films and I feel
73:53
like silent film is gone it's gone
73:55
beyond that phase with something is
73:57
old-fashioned to where it's become
73:59
almost timeless and people are
74:01
recognizing that it's a unique way of
74:03
telling the story it's also a unique
74:05
picture into the past
74:06
[Music]
74:26
there is absolutely no doubt that
74:29
professional sports is big business
74:32
around the world it's estimated that the
74:35
global sports market is worth in excess
74:37
of one hundred and forty billion dollars
74:40
a year while football or soccer is still
74:44
the dominant sport in Europe Africa and
74:47
Latin America cricket dominates the
74:51
Indian subcontinent and American
74:54
football baseball and basketball lead
74:57
the North American sports market but no
75:01
matter what the sport and where it's
75:03
being played the financial rewards of a
75:05
leap level sport cannot be
75:07
underestimated
75:09
sports team coffers are filled with
75:12
income from ticket sales or gate
75:14
revenues ticket prices vary wildly from
75:18
country to country and sport to sports
75:20
but can be astonishing the cheapest
75:24
matchday ticket to see Chelsea Football
75:26
Club play in the English Premier League
75:28
the wealthiest football league in the
75:30
world costs 50 pounds or around 80 US
75:34
dollars huge sums of money are generated
75:38
from television and media rights with
75:41
millions of fans watching live coverage
75:43
of matches and tournaments from their
75:45
homes around the world and increasingly
75:48
on the move on their smartphones to
75:52
merchandising is vital to the teams as
75:55
well with fans eager to snap up the
75:57
latest kit to show their team loyalty
76:00
and many teams logos now appearing on
76:03
ever more diverse items but it's
76:07
reported that the single biggest
76:09
financial contribution to global sports
76:11
revenue is made by sponsorship
76:15
payments made by companies to have their
76:18
brand name associated with successful
76:20
sports teams and tournaments and there
76:23
aren't just corporate riches on offer
76:26
ultimately it's the performance of
76:28
individual athletes that these global
76:30
sporting brands are built upon and
76:33
there's little doubt that the elite few
76:36
are handsomely rewarded for their
76:38
sporting prowess by their club salaries
76:41
and competition winnings and buy
76:43
personal multi-million dollar
76:45
sponsorship deals so the allure of such
76:49
a lucrative albeit often short-lived
76:52
professional sporting career is obvious
76:55
these days it would be fair to assume
76:58
that as much as any young athlete may
77:00
strive for the glory of playing for
77:02
their favourite team or the honour of
77:05
representing their country they're also
77:07
driven by the potential financial
77:09
rewards on offer and more than ever
77:14
raw talent and innate ability alone are
77:16
not going to get you into the echelon of
77:19
the elite athletes
77:20
it requires starting young training
77:24
relentlessly having a dedicated team
77:27
behind you and most importantly of all
77:29
it now takes science to make it to the
77:32
top of sport as world beating teams like
77:36
British Cycling know victory today is
77:39
all about marginal gains the team breaks
77:43
down the sport into its tiniest
77:45
individual elements from the design of
77:47
the helmets to the type of pillow the
77:49
athletes sleep on and how they wash
77:51
their hands then using science to help
77:55
them they find ways to improve each and
77:58
every element by just 1%
78:02
the resulting combined improvements in
78:04
performance can mean the difference
78:06
between the silver and gold medals and
78:10
when your team wins seven out of a
78:13
possible 10 Olympic gold medals in your
78:15
sport like the British cycling track
78:17
team did in 2012 you know it's a system
78:21
that works
78:24
you
78:27
[Music]
78:38
the role that science plays in the
78:41
development of elite athletes is
78:42
multidisciplinary but it can be broken
78:45
down into three core areas biomechanics
78:49
physiology and psychology biomechanics
78:54
looks at the mechanics of human movement
78:57
the discipline often includes the study
79:00
of the interaction between an athlete
79:02
and their equipment and environment with
79:05
the aim of enhancing performance and
79:07
avoiding injury the design of sporting
79:14
equipment is constantly evolving and
79:17
sometimes changes to their kit whether
79:20
it be Footwear racquets or clubs can
79:23
make or break an athlete's physiology
79:27
the study of how exercise changes the
79:29
function and structure of the body is
79:31
one of the most obvious ways that
79:33
science is integrated into the sporting
79:36
development of athletes scientific
79:39
methods and technology are used to
79:41
assess and monitor how athletes bodies
79:44
respond to training both physically and
79:47
chemically this data enables coaches to
79:51
evaluate an athletes potential and
79:53
allows specific training programs to be
79:56
developed to ensure optimal performance
79:58
is achieved a simple scientific tests
80:03
like vo2 max which measures the maximum
80:06
rate at which the heart lungs and
80:08
muscles can use oxygen during exercise
80:11
is now a standard training tool for any
80:15
professional athlete participants wear a
80:19
mask on a treadmill or cycle their
80:23
exercise intensity is gradually
80:25
increased and the levels of oxygen and
80:28
carbon dioxide are monitored with
80:31
analysis of the data gathered this test
80:33
can accurately measure fitness levels
80:36
the test repeated regularly can gauge
80:39
the effect of any trainer
80:41
on the athletes fitness athletes who
80:46
take part in sports that require
80:48
endurance such as long-distance running
80:51
or rowing often have the highest vo2
80:54
scores in recent years more efficient
80:59
ways of improving Fitness have been
81:01
developed through the use of this type
81:03
of scientific data a good example of
81:07
this is high-intensity interval training
81:09
often referred to as hit it has been
81:13
proved that athletes can improve their
81:15
fitness level much more effectively by
81:17
exercising in repeated short bursts of
81:20
very intense activity some research has
81:25
suggested that it might only take three
81:28
minutes of high-intensity exercise a
81:30
week to considerably improve the fitness
81:33
of the average person
81:38
psychology is perhaps the most
81:40
challenging discipline of sports science
81:42
while it's easy to quantify how a
81:45
physical training program can improve an
81:47
athlete's performance it's much more
81:51
difficult to assess the role that
81:52
psychology plays but there's no doubt
81:55
that a positive mental attitude is
81:57
absolutely essential for success in
82:00
high-level sport professional athletes
82:04
work with sports psychologists who help
82:07
them to achieve and maintain high levels
82:09
of self-confidence motivation and
82:12
concentration during training and
82:14
competition and perhaps most importantly
82:17
of all psychologists will also help them
82:20
to control their emotions and deal with
82:23
adversity when things aren't going their
82:25
way because every professional athlete
82:29
knows that even with the best coaches
82:31
and scientists in the world on your side
82:33
victory will ultimately boil down to you
82:37
versus your opponents and who wants it
82:39
more
82:40
you
82:47
[Music]
82:57
it goes without saying that technology
83:00
plays a pivotal role in our lives even
83:04
if you don't consider yourself a techno
83:06
geek it's more than likely that you'll
83:09
find it hard to imagine life without a
83:11
mobile phone or access to the Internet
83:14
we already live in a world where it's
83:17
possible to create 3d objects with a
83:19
printer where we are constantly tracked
83:21
and monitored
83:23
self-drive cars and artificial
83:26
intelligence are a reality and experts
83:29
promise the imminent arrival of the
83:31
internet of things that will control our
83:34
homes and lives but hand-in-hand with
83:37
this increasing reliance on technology
83:40
and electricity there is a corresponding
83:42
risk that we will find ourselves
83:43
completely unable to function as a
83:46
society without it the specter of a lack
83:51
of electricity and cyber terrorism
83:52
already loom large and on a more
83:57
practical level our dependence on
83:59
technology is already having quite
84:01
serious consequences on our abilities
84:04
and skillsets
84:07
what would happen if you found yourself
84:09
without a phone without power without a
84:12
GPS signal alone and lost in the
84:15
wilderness how many of us would be able
84:18
to cope how many of us even have the
84:21
basic skills to survive
84:23
[Music]
84:24
Jason Inga Mills is an expert in
84:27
wilderness survival skills and drawing
84:29
on a wealth of personal experience
84:31
he teaches these skills to others and
84:33
can offer life-saving advice so my name
84:37
is Jason Ingham else and I'm the
84:39
director for woodland ways bushcraft and
84:41
survival and what we do is we take
84:44
groups out to various locations
84:45
throughout the UK and overseas and we
84:48
practice bushcraft and survival skills
84:49
and wilderness living skills
84:51
I'm survival skills for me is about
84:54
trying to get yourself out of a
84:56
situation that you've not necessarily
84:58
chosen to find yourself in and that is
85:01
overcoming those four principles of
85:03
survival fire food shelter and water I
85:05
teach on the rules of three okay and
85:08
those are three minutes without oxygen
85:10
three hours without shelter three days
85:13
without water and three weeks without
85:15
food now I'm going to presume that
85:18
everybody has the ability to be able to
85:20
breathe so my pure focus is on shelter
85:23
immediately
85:23
we need to regulate how our body gains
85:26
and loses body heat so we need to
85:29
maintain our core temperature and
85:31
clothing is an extension of that but
85:34
also the ability to get yourself into an
85:37
area which is waterproof and windproof
85:39
shelter is always the highest priority
85:41
now three weeks without food may sound
85:44
like a very very long time and indeed it
85:47
is and again not suggesting that you
85:51
should leave it for three weeks and then
85:52
go out and acquire food but it's
85:54
certainly a lower priority for you if
85:56
you're ingesting food your body needs
85:59
water to ingest it so if water is of a
86:01
concern you've got limited supplies
86:03
you're better off not eating and so we
86:07
build on that skill set we get people
86:09
learning how to create fire from natural
86:12
materials how to construct shelters that
86:15
will be completely waterproof and
86:17
windproof again out of natural materials
86:20
how to get their water and make that
86:23
water safe to drink and also how to
86:25
acquire the wrong food whether that's
86:27
from animal or plant
86:33
[Music]
86:43
The Woodlands way weekend is one of
86:46
Jason's most popular courses and just
86:50
two days in the woods can prove
86:52
life-changing so I cater for a large
86:57
range of different age groups everything
87:00
from eight years old up to 80 years old
87:01
a family course is going to be very
87:04
different from an adult's only weekend
87:06
course however the vast majority of the
87:09
customers are coming out of the city
87:11
they're young professionals you know
87:14
3040 year olds who maybe want to decomp
87:18
liqu ate their lives just a little bit
87:19
we live in a society now where we have
87:22
complete reliance on other people and
87:25
the skills that we teach are more about
87:27
self-reliance you know we can't come out
87:29
here and flick a switch and have light
87:32
and turn a dial and have heat you've got
87:34
to provide it for yourself and I think
87:36
that connection
87:37
with being responsible for your own
87:40
safety and your own welfare really
87:44
connects with people that have been
87:45
removed from it for so long people don't
87:48
use knives on a daily basis now there's
87:51
at all people don't prepare their own
87:53
food there's a reliance on other people
87:56
to do things for words and so therefore
87:58
what I'm doing is I'm almost rebuilding
88:01
their knowledge base of how to look
88:03
after themselves so it can be quite
88:05
shocking sometimes and I think we can
88:09
see that technology is having a major
88:11
input into the lack of those skills now
88:14
we can press a button and we've got
88:16
access to a wealth of questionable
88:19
information sometimes but certainly
88:21
information and I don't think technology
88:23
is necessarily a bad thing but we
88:25
shouldn't use technology to turn our
88:27
back on these old skills at the end of
88:30
the day if we lose these skills and then
88:32
technology fails where does that leave
88:34
us and we have fire it's strange because
88:38
I see people going on a journey as they
88:40
come through with us so for the first 24
88:43
hours or so they're in an unusual
88:46
environment
88:46
it's alien to them and the thing that
88:49
they miss the most is actually the
88:50
technology they miss being in contact
88:53
with other human beings their social
88:55
networks they're not able to you know
88:58
Nippon to Facebook and and do an update
89:01
status they can't communicate with their
89:04
normal social network through technology
89:07
and so they go through a journey of
89:10
almost having to release themselves from
89:13
that but as the time progresses and they
89:17
realize that actually the world is
89:19
around them here it's not on the screen
89:21
in front of them you get a
89:24
transformation they relax more and they
89:26
really tune into the environment and
89:28
then 24 hours later they're completely
89:30
different they're noticing things that
89:32
they would have never noticed before
89:33
because they would have been looking
89:35
like that and then you start to get a
89:38
connection with the real world that
89:40
you're in rather than the cyber world
89:43
which is on a tablet so getting back to
89:46
basics getting people out there you can
89:48
see I see a transformation they arrive
89:50
on the Friday night they leave on a
89:52
Sunday a different person completely
89:57

90:07
on the evening of the 28th of February
90:11
1953 two scientists Francis Crick and
90:15
James Watson walked into the Eagle pub
90:18
to celebrate a good day's work at the
90:21
nearby University of Cambridge Cavendish
90:23
laboratory Crick boldly announced that
90:27
they had just discovered the secret of
90:29
life as hyperbolic as it sounded a few
90:33
months later the pair published a paper
90:35
in the scientific journal Nature where
90:38
they revealed that they had discovered
90:40
the structure of DNA the stuff of life
90:44
the iconic double helix in their words
90:48
this structure has novel features which
90:51
are of considerable biological interest
90:54
it explained how genetic information is
90:57
stored copied and passed on through the
91:00
generations the same journal also
91:04
contained papers by Morris Wilkins and
91:07
rosalind Franklin who had been
91:09
responsible for the research and the
91:12
defining image that enabled Crick and
91:14
Watson to create their structural model
91:19
the elucidation of the structure of DNA
91:22
was a turning point in molecular biology
91:25
it started a scientific revolution and
91:29
ushered in the era of genetic and
91:31
genomic research that would change
91:33
medicine as we know it so to build a
91:37
human body you need to know what
91:42
proteins to use you need to know what
91:45
processes to activate and when and where
91:48
in the body and the DNA both gives the
91:52
information to build the proteins and
91:54
contains the information the programming
91:57
language if you like of when and where
91:59
to switch those proteins on so DNA is a
92:02
very simple molecule in some ways it
92:05
consists of a string of bases and we
92:08
represent those bases by four letters
92:10
hey CJ and team professor Julian
92:14
Parkhill works at the Wellcome Trust
92:15
genome campus outside Cambridge
92:19
scientists here have always been at the
92:21
forefront of genomic research and they
92:24
were part of the global team that
92:26
undertook the biological equivalent of
92:28
traveling to the moon the human genome
92:31
project work started on the project in
92:34
1990 and it was one of the most
92:36
ambitious scientific ventures in history
92:40
the human genome has around 3 billion
92:42
base pairs it there are two copies of F
92:48
every genes so in total around 6 billion
92:50
base pairs but most of those are
92:51
identical so the original project aimed
92:55
to sequence that haploid genome a single
92:59
copy the 3 billion base pairs so the
93:02
human genome project was a massive
93:04
undertaking it involved very large
93:05
numbers of
93:06
from people from different countries
93:08
different institutes working at
93:11
different times so it's difficult to be
93:12
exact about the numbers
93:14
but yes through it figure estimated that
93:16
it it cost probably around three billion
93:18
dollars it involved at one stage rather
93:20
at least 5,000 people from 20 different
93:24
institutes around the world we produced
93:27
a third of the finished sequence which
93:30
is the largest single contribution for
93:32
many institutes around the world the
93:36
human genome project was completed in
93:38
April 2003
93:40
the reference genome determined the
93:43
exact order of base pairs in a human
93:46
being and is presented as page after
93:49
page of text with just four letters a C
93:53
G and T each gene appears as bold text
93:58
on the page they have printed it out in
94:02
a set of books and it's a bookshelf
94:05
around three feet wide and six feet high
94:09
and it contains your fifty books of a
94:14
very large hardback size so it's a
94:17
substantial amount of text
