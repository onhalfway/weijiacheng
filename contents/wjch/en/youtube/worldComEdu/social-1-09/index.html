== Changes in Communication ==
People use tools to communicate. New inventions make communication easier. People in the past used slates, chalk, and ink for writing. In the present, people use computers and notebooks for writing. The telephone and printing press are inventions that help communication. 
In the present, people use cellular phones to talk. The printing press is a machine that makes newspapers and books. In the past people got information by talking to other people. Now newspapers and books are important for people to learn from.
Modern communication tools such as the Internet are important to our daily life and education. Every day we use new inventions and important tools to help us communicate.</p>

hello everybody welcome back to American
textbook reading I'm Brian Stewart
we're on lesson nine and we're talking
about changes in communication so in
this lesson you will discover new
inventions made communication easier so
new inventions made communication easier
we can see some different types of
inventions on our title page here our
warmup
this is a very old telephone it was
really great when it was first invented
but now it's old-fashioned right this is
a new invention it's a cell phone
it's a really convenient invention it's
what we use nowadays so changes in
communication how people communicate
with each other let's take a look first
of all we saw invention right on the
previous slide we saw an example of two
inventions the telephone an old
telephone and a modern-day telephone
well an invention is something new or a
new way of doing something so it's
interesting to think about that
invention isn't just something new
that's an object right it's an object if
you create something new that's an
object like a telephone or a cell phone
but take this out check this out a new
way a new way of doing something that is
a method so inventions can be physical
objects things we touch or use but they
can also be things we don't touch just
things that we do right it's not
something we can look at it's not
something we can pick up it's just a way
of behaving or a way of doing something
a method so inventions are really two
types object a physical thing or a
method a way of doing something and if
you think of a new way of doing
something
that's an invention too by the way it's
very interesting we have many words in
this unit that start that end with tion
invention invention whenever you see
tion you know that that word is a noun
many of these words are also used as
verbs and we drop io n we say to in
vents right so invention is a noun to
invent right we we get rid of io n we
have a verb to invent so if you make
something new or you think of a new way
of doing something you are inventing you
have an invention okay we'll see many
words like this in today's lesson let's
take a look at the next one tool a tool
is a thing it's a thing so it's an
object that helps people do a job when
you do your job what is your job you are
students right so your job is to do
homework what tools do you use to do
your job you probably use paper right a
notebook and a pencil
those are your tools those tools help
you do a job your homework but there are
many jobs aren't there and many
different tools these are typically many
what we think of when we think of tools
right a paintbrush for a painter who
wants to paint something our wrench for
a plumber who wants to fix something
these are all tools that people use to
do their job it helps them do their job
okay here's another IO n or a tion
education right education is teaching or
training people and the things people
learn so really we've got two two parts
to this definition teaching or training
people that's one part and the things
people learn the things people learn
that's the second part okay so education
is all of that right now we are involved
in edge
what we're doing right now is education
I am educating you guys right education
education is a noun but to educate is a
verb ed jus Kate so you see we can take
many of these io n verbs which are nouns
and make them into verbs right education
we are involved in education right now I
am educating you so good word education
let's move on information another tion
word right there's so many of them right
information facts or details that you
know about something so how many facts
and details do you know you probably
know a lot of information right
especially if you've been studying these
books quite a bit right so we've been
learning a lot of information facts or
details if you look at something of
course he's looking at very specific
facts and details about something but
when we think about science you know
about the earth or about insects or
animals or people those are facts or
details we know about those subjects
that is information now as we are doing
we're looking at these words and we see
that they are nouns what is the verb
form of information what is the verb
form if you guess to in form right so to
inform to inform is like to tell
somebody about something to tell them
about the facts or details that you know
you're going to tell somebody else you
will inform them right now I am
informing you right I'm informing you
about this word information and many
other words as well okay so let's move
on communication really long word right
of course we have tion again there's so
many of them right in English we have
this is a very common ending for many
words tion communication communication
okay so what is commute
ocation the way the way it's a method
right it's a method people share ideas
and exchange information so when we talk
when we inform each other when we
educate people we share ideas we
exchange information right so teachers
or parents will educate children right
or children will inform their parents
about their day right they will tell
them they will give them the facts or
details about something that happened to
them so we are always exchanging our
ideas aren't we we communicate with many
people around us every day and I just
used the verb to communicate to
communicate we communicate with each
other every day that is communication we
call this process this method
communication the action is to
communicate so we are communicating
right now right okay let's move on we
have another word here machine a machine
a machine is a tool remember we talked
about tools before we saw the pictures
of the tools but those tools we saw
before are very simple they don't have
really many moving parts maybe just one
part that moves but a machine is a
complex machine it's a complex tool it
has many parts and it's used for a
particular job and another thing about a
machine is that you can turn it on you
use electricity and it works and it does
something for you in fact machines do
work instead of people right with
machines we can do so much more than we
can do with just simple tools and one
person or a few people machines can work
very quickly and they can do dangerous
jobs and they can produce many amazing
things this
seen here is busy making a car so
machines are complex tools not simple
tools but complex tools that are used
for a particular job a certain job for
example a printing press a printing
press is an example of a machine right a
printing press is a machine that is used
to make books or newspapers so if you
have your books right you have a book in
front of you right now right how was
that book made it was made on a really
big machine called a printing press also
when you get your newspaper right at
your house if you get a newspaper
delivered to your house that newspaper
is printed on a printing press let's
take a look of a printing press in
action this is a printing press here
this is the paper let's take a look wow
that's really fast isn't it it's going
really fast and look at how big this
machine is it's really big and it's
coming up through here and the drums
have different colors and they're
putting the ink on the paper as the
paper goes through it's really fast and
of course this machine can make many
books or many newspapers very very
quickly much faster than people can if
they didn't have a machine so machines
make our lives easier they allow us to
do our work very well very quickly and
to make many many things in a short
period of time so that's an example of a
printing press now let's take a look at
another very old tool okay this is a
much older tool a slate a slate is a
writing tablet of course a long time ago
you know people really didn't have paper
they may have had something they could
have carried around a piece of charcoal
or a piece of of something around with
them and they call this late and they
use chalk to draw on it or to write on
it so people would use a slate to write
on it and they could pass it to another
person and they could take it on a very
far away and another person could read
the message so this is a very old style
of communicate
right not many people use slates
nowadays sometimes we use slates for fun
but it's not really practical normally
we use notebooks and paper instead of
slates okay this is a chart showing how
communication has changed over the years
here we have communication inventions
right we talked about inventions
inventions or objects usually machines
not always but also ways of doing things
in this case of course we're talking
about objects and we are talking about
ways to communicate there's many
different inventions here in 1876 can
you imagine that long ago that was a
long time ago right almost a hundred
fifty years ago almost 150 years ago the
telephone was invented who invented the
telephone do you remember that's right
Alexander Graham Bell invented the
telephone Alexander Graham Bell I'll
just write his last name here
Bell Bell invented the telephone in 1876
then in 1902 the radio was invented the
radio was invented and people were able
to hear another person's voice from a
long far far away and they didn't have
to have wires right the telephone you
needed a wire to connect one telephone
to another telephone both the radio you
didn't need wires people spoke in one
place and their sound went through the
air and you could pick it up on a radio
really great invention well the radio of
course came before the television the
television was invented in 1927 the
television was different from the radio
how you could hear the radio what could
you hear you could hear voices but with
the television you could hear voices and
see pictures this was a really big deal
of course in 1927
amazing you could send pictures through
the air people were really surprised at
this invention it was like magic right
now nowadays we think but it's normal
but think about that a long time ago
these things were new
amazing inventions people were very
amazed they thought it was like magic
how can you send pictures through the
air nowadays we don't think about it but
a long time ago they were very amazing
inventions of course nowadays we may not
use the radio or television so much some
people we still use the telephone a lot
but more and more people are using what
in 1994 the internet was invented or
became used by many many people around
the world and more and more people are
using the Internet to listen to sound or
to look at pictures you might use the
internet to look at your favorite music
videos right on YouTube or something
like that so the YouTube is kind of
replacing all of these other things also
you can use the Internet to talk to
people using different programs you can
talk from one person in Korea you can
talk to somebody in Canada or Australia
or Europe over the internet so you see
these different inventions progress
through time and things are getting
better and better you guys are actually
very lucky you live in a time where
there are many many inventions that are
already in use but think about that a
hundred years ago there a lot of the
inventions that you use now they weren't
in existence right so you're kind of
lucky you have a very convenient life
think about that sometimes about all the
inventions that are around you maybe
when you get older you can make an
invention yourself if you think about
some way to make life easier or more
convenience okay let's move on okay we
have our word matching exercise here we
have our words and we have our
definitions we need to match them
together let's take a look at the words
remember some of these are kind of long
but many of them end in tion tion
let's practice invention invention tool
that's easy right tool education
education okay information
information communication communication
really long right communication machine
machine okay those are our words let's
match them to the definitions number one
a thing that helps people do a job so
it's a thing that helps you do a job
very specifically so think about the
examples I gave you a pencil a piece of
paper right
we saw the paintbrush we saw the wrench
what is a thing that helps people do a
job of these words what can we say we
can say a tool a tool is a thing that
helps people do a job now it's true if
you chose invention that could also be
an answer right but tool is a better
choice for this because invention has a
special meaning we'll talk about that a
little bit okay but tool is specifically
a thing that helps people do a job okay
number two facts or details that you
know about something so if you have some
knowledge you have facts or details in
your mind and you know those facts are
details you know that about something
what are those facts and details what do
we call that right if you have those
facts or details in your mind and you
want to tell somebody you say I want to
inform you right so what's the noun form
of course it's information the facts and
details that you have in your mind those
are it that is information that is
information information is non-count
don't say information is right but we
say those facts and details that is
information
oh yeah number three something new or a
new way of doing something so something
new or a new way of doing something that
of course when you invent something you
have made an invention okay that's
invention so of course an invention can
be a tool but when it's first
invented when it's when it's new and
it's a new way of doing something we say
of course it's an invention that's a
particular meaning right there because
it's new it's a new way of doing
something or it's something new that you
made okay let's move on to number four
the way people share ideas and exchange
information so you want to share ideas
with somebody you want to exchange
information you want to communicate with
somebody of course the way that you
communicate is called communication
communication that's the way the method
that you share ideas or exchange
information we call that communication
okay and there's a lot of words you
could use are you good at communication
right are you good at communication that
means you have good communication skills
right so communication number five
teaching or training people and the
things people learn so when we're
talking about teaching people or
training people by the way what's the
difference between teaching and training
teaching and training that's interesting
there's a little bit of a difference
there when you teach somebody you're
giving them information you're giving
them like theoretical knowledge you're
telling them about the theory of
something the idea about something right
now I am educating you training somebody
is teaching somebody specifically how to
do something if I'm going to teach you
how to swim then I'm training you how to
swim to do a skill so teaching is more
about information or knowledge training
is about how to do something like a
skill like swimming or rock climbing or
even scuba diving right that's training
okay so that's a little bit different
but all of those whether you're teaching
somebody information or you're teaching
somebody training them how to do
something we call this what education
right so it's education and the person
who is teaching or training is an
educator they are educating the other
people their students so right now I am
educating you about these words number
six a tool with a with complex complex
not simple complex parts that is used
for a particular job and also when we
talked about this you usually use
electricity with it you turn it on and
it starts to vibrate right it starts to
hum it's ready to work what do we call
that of course that is called a machine
so a tool with complex parts that is
used for a particular job and usually it
needs energy to work like electricity or
some other type of energy in order to
work ok let's move on to our chart here
we have inventions in making books now
books are an interesting way to
communicate aren't they we saw the slide
before many different inventions we saw
the telephone the radio television and
the internet books are another invention
that was made in order to communicate
now books are special because books are
a way to communicate over a long period
of time you can read books that were
written a hundred years ago two hundred
years ago three hundred years ago books
are a good way to communicate over a
long period of time of course we can
read them now but it's also an
interesting thing to think about when
you write something down people can read
your book and if your book is popular
and many people like it they will read
it for many many years after you've
written that book so books are an
interesting way or an a good invention
for communication it's a way to
communicate now how were books invented
what was the history of books what was a
history of writing well a long long time
ago ancient Egyptians ancient Egyptians
we're talking like two thousand years
ago more than two thousand years ago
even three thousand years ago ancient
Egyptians wrote on papyrus papyrus what
is papyrus papyrus is kind of a
type of paper that was very difficult to
make to pronounce this word think of
Papa you know Popeye the sailorman
papyrus
okay papyrus and they wrote on this
material and they could save it now
papyrus didn't last for a long time they
had to be very careful if it got wet or
if it was in a wet a humid climate it
wouldn't last for many many years but if
it was very dry it would last for a very
long time and sometimes in the very dry
desert like an Egypt and other places in
the Middle East we can still find old
papyrus that was left for thousands of
years and we can read what people wrote
very interesting now later on paper
which was easier to make and it was a
lighter and more convenient to use paper
was invented in China a little bit later
well a little bit later a long time
later many hundreds of years later after
they invented paper right of course you
could write a lot on it but paper was
invented people would write on the paper
but P person had to write on the paper
so if you wanted to make him any books
you had to have many people and all
those people would sit there and they
would write the letters very carefully
and that's how books were made this was
very time-consuming right he imagined a
machine that could speed up that process
and make that process much quicker and
much easier well in 1448 Johannes
Gutenberg invented the printing press in
Europe to make that really fast a lot
faster now this is not Johannes
Gutenberg right this is a photograph and
they didn't have a cameras in 1448 but
this is an example of an old printing
press that they used right it was it was
a machine it made the job easier but it
was still difficult to use right you had
to have a lot of strength to to move it
around and press on the paper but it was
a machine that allowed people to print
books much faster than everybody sitting
around and and drawing on the pages so
the printing press was
first machine that allowed people to
print books many books in a short period
of time and the books would always be
the same as each other you can make
copies now you can make one copy exactly
the same as the original copy before you
couldn't do that because even if it's
the same person they have to make a new
book by hand you can't always do it
exactly the same okay so the printing
press was invented in 1448 it really
that's when we really started the
explosion of making books and more and
more books became popular people can
read more and more and more and more
people became educated they were able to
get an education much easier with books
okay let's take a look at the pictures
and write the word that best describes
them okay so what have we got going on
here we have many different pictures and
one of these pictures showing they are
showing a way of sharing information
right so let's take a look here there is
a little girl what is she doing she's
holding her hand to her head like this
and if we look closely we can see she
has a cell phone in her hand so she is
doing something with another person we
can't see right now okay that's the word
that we need what is she doing what act
or what thing is she doing right now
she's engaged in some type of process
over here in the middle these people we
can see both people they're both engaged
in it and what are they doing they
they're using their hands to talk right
and this is what some people will do if
they cannot hear people who are deaf or
mute they cannot speak some people
cannot hear some people cannot speak and
so they need to use their hands to do
whatever this is this by the way is
called sign language this picture sign
language sign language is the way that
people will communicate with their hands
okay and their bodies too okay so they
are engaged in sign language but they're
doing something now this woman here
she's using the computer and look at all
these
pieces of paper flying out of her
computer I'm just kidding that's just a
trying right she is sending letters she
is sending email to many of her friends
and maybe she's getting email too now
all of these people are doing the same
thing what are they doing do you
remember the word that we used that we
learned earlier of course they are all
engaged in communication they are all
using different forms of communication
so as you can see communication has many
different styles you can talk on a cell
phone you can use sign language with a
friend or with somebody you know you can
use the computer to communicate with
other people all of these people are
communicating they are engaged in
communication they are engaged engaged
in communication engaged means that they
are involved they are doing something
what are they doing they are involved in
communication they are engaged in
communication okay so that's of course
the topic for our lesson of course today
as well
changes in communication okay let's take
a look at our true/false questions we
need to Circle T for true after false
for each one of these statements number
one inventions are facts or details that
you know about something does that sound
correct right so inventions what are
inventions inventions are things or ways
of doing something that are new somebody
comes along and thinks of a new way of
doing something that's an invention so
this doesn't sound right right
inventions are facts or details no
inventions are new things or new ways of
doing something so this is false if we
want to make the sentence true we can
change one word do you know what word
that's right if we change inventions to
what in 4 may shun aha information if we
change in from
- information information our facts are
details that you know about something
that's true right but not inventions so
we have to change the sentence okay
number two paper was invented in Egypt
paper was invented in Egypt
remember that chart we saw we talked
about ancient Egypt then we talked about
China then we talked about Johannes
Gutenberg right what was the thing about
China we saw that paper was invented in
China not in Egypt right that's false so
it wasn't an Egypt it was in China do
you remember what the Egyptians used
what did ancient Egyptians use remember
I told you about the cartoon character -
remember the name papyrus
papyrus they used papyrus in Egypt but
paper was invented in China okay number
three a printing press is a machine that
is used to make books or newspapers is
that true think about the video we saw
earlier in the lesson right we saw that
machine with the many pieces of paper
running through and the the little drums
would put the ink on the paper and the
paper was going through really fast and
you can make many books and many
newspapers and what was that machine
called that's right it was called a
printing press so this is true this is a
true statement a printing press is a
machine that is used to make books or
newspapers okay let's take a short break
here and we'll come back and go over the
reading section
hello everybody welcome back to the
reading section of course we're in unit
9 talking about changes in communication
so of course that's what our reading
skill our reading passage is about the
reading passage is people use tools to
communicate that is the topic sentence
of our reading passage because that is
the sentence that unifies our topic what
are we talking about we're talking about
using tools certain types of tools to do
what you use a tool to do a job
in this case we're using a tools to
communicate so we're gonna talk about
tools but we're also gonna talk about
changes in those tools the different
types of tools and the history of the
tools and we can see that new inventions
make communication easier so actually
these two sentences tell us what our
topic of the reading passage is first of
all people use tools to communicate yes
more specifically new inventions make
communication easier
and remember inventions are tools right
tools are types of inventions so we you
see tools and we see inventions people
use tools to communicate new inventions
make communication easier so what we're
going to look at are inventions that
were used in the past and inventions
that are used in the present let's take
a look
people in the past so this is a long
time ago right people in the past use
slates remember we talked about slates
slates are that like a piece of a
blackboard really from your classroom
don't do that don't take the blackboard
from your classroom but it would be like
a small piece of your blackboard that
you could carry around with you and you
use chalk and you wrote with it on chalk
right so people use slates chalk they
used ink with paper
not with slates they used ink for
writing and that's what people did in
the past for hundreds of years that was
the only way to send a message to
somebody far away right if you couldn't
go there you would have to write on a
slate or write on a piece of paper and
send it to that person and that was the
only way to communicate for hundreds and
hundreds of years okay and the present
things are different things are easier
right in the present nowadays people use
computers and notebooks for writing so
you of course use notebooks for writing
in class and when you're doing homework
you use a notebook probably you use a
computer very often as well you can
email people and you can
talk to people all from far distances
away using your computer whether it's
email chatting or whatever you're doing
right you can use a computer or notebook
for writing nowadays the telephone and
printing press are inventions that help
communication so here we see two
inventions that they're talking about
one is the telephone number two the
printing press these are two inventions
they are inventions that help
communication help people communicate
right with the invention of the
telephone
now people didn't have to write letters
to each other they could call each other
instantly and talk to each other at the
very same moment Wow right before they
had to write a letter and send it and
maybe it takes three months to get to
the other person and then another three
months to get back to you oh my gosh but
think about a telephone now that you can
call and talk right away amazing
invention at the time the telephone and
printing press of course you can make
many books at the same time it didn't
take so long to write each book by hand
okay so in the present right people use
cellular phones cellular phones to talk
we of course say just cell phones it's
much easier to say that cell phones
people use cell phones why to talk they
use cell phones to talk same thing the
printing press is a machine that makes
newspapers and books okay so here we
have like our sentence here two
inventions the telephone in the present
people use cell phones to talk the other
sentence talking about the second
invention the printing press is a
machine that makes newspapers and books
and makes them very quickly moving on in
the past again we have here in the past
people got information you get
information from someplace people got
information by talking to other people
in other words talking to people who
were close by them or around them right
so that was the way people can
mutated in the past by talking to people
who are next to them now that's our
difference now newspapers and books are
important for people to learn from
nowadays people can use newspapers and
books to learn about things or facts
details that happened all far ways away
especially when you can't talk to people
who are far away you can get a newspaper
or a book and read about their life or
what happened over there modern
communication tools modern communication
tools the tools we use nowadays in order
to communicate modern communication
tools such as the Internet are important
to our daily life and education
education such as
means for example right such as is like
for example modern communication tools
for example the internet such as the
Internet
are important of course they're very
important to our daily life and for our
education think about how often you use
the internet when you're learning about
a new subject there's so much
information available at your fingertips
you can get a lot of information using
the Internet
every day we use new inventions and
important tools to help us communicate
so every day in our daily lives we use
what we use new inventions we use
important tools to help us communicate
so we used two things in our life modern
life people are inventing things so
quickly right it seems like things are
happening so quickly many new inventions
are coming out so we use new inventions
almost every day and we also use
important tools that have already been
invented a long time ago we use those
important tools why to help us to
communicate tools help us do our job or
help us do something we want to do ok
let's take a look at our reading skill
as we can see in the reading scale
remember I kept underlining in
past and now that's very important to
look at in terms of to compare and
contrast we can compare
in contrast the past and the present so
the past and the present are different
and we can talk about how they are
different let's take a look people use
slates chalk and beep for writing that
was in the past right we have to fill in
these blanks our words our computers
books ink cellular phones and
communicate so in the past what did
people use to communicate or for writing
what did people use for writing they use
slates they use chalk what else did they
use did they use computers in the past
now computers are a recent invention did
they use cellular phones to communicate
for writing now cellular phones are a
recent invention did they use books for
writing yeah but they also used ink
right when we looked at the passage we
saw that they used ink they use slates
chalk and ink for writings long time ago
right nowadays in the present people use
what and notebooks for writing so
nowadays people will use computers and
notebooks for writing because computers
is a recent invention it's an invention
that belongs in modern times in the
present day ok in the past people got
information by talking to other people
so talking to other people communicating
with other people in the present
nowadays people get information from
newspapers right and what else do they
get information from they also get
information from books
okay so newspapers and books nowadays
people get information from those things
people use what to talk so people can
talk with each other you know even from
a long distances from far away what do
they use to talk to be able to
communicate in that manner of course
they use cellular phones to talk so they
can use cellular phones to talk to each
other now these are things that are
different right
in the past people use that in the
present people do this but on the bottom
this is one way that things have stayed
the same no change in the past and the
present things have stayed the same what
is it
people use tools to what what are they
doing what is all of this that we're
talking about here we're talking of
course about communicate to communicate
people use tools to communicate we need
to use the verb form not communication
but remember the verb form is to
communicate and of course the noun is
communication how people talk to each
other how people exchange ideas that
method is communication what are people
doing they're communicating so people
use tools to communicate ok let's go
over our reading comprehension questions
how well do you remember the reading
passage number 1 inventions have made
beep easier we have to choose from a B
and C so we were just talking about this
subject just on the last slide it's the
subject of course of our unit are we
talking about inventions have made
telephones easier that doesn't make
sense
inventions have made newspapers easier
they it's very strange to say it makes
an object easier right telephones and
newspapers are objects what about C
communication communication is a method
of exchanging ideas the way of
exchanging ideas so yes if you're
talking about method or the way of doing
something you can make that easier
absolutely and inventions of course have
made communication easier that's our
answer right now of course inventions
like telephones and newspapers those are
inventions but those are inventions that
have made communication easier so it's
kind of an interesting a problem here an
interesting question right but be
careful because the inventions haven't
made other inventions easier inventions
have made communication easier number
two what is the most
modern most modern the most recent
communication tool so we have to think
about the history of communication
remember the chart we saw a long time
ago started off with the telephone the
radio and that went on what was the most
recent the latest invention or
communication tool let's take a look a
slate is a well we have a slate the
internet and a printing press which is
the most recent ok if we look at it of
course we can choose right away that the
Internet is the most recent out of the
three a slate was used a long time ago
right with chalk and a printing press
was invented in 1448 Johannes Gutenberg
right so those are old inventions right
the newest the most modern is the
Internet most modern means the latest or
the most recent invention something that
has been invented just a little while
ago not a long long time ago ok ok let's
move on to number three the printing
press is what is the printing press it's
a tool sure it's a tool used to make
movies and newspapers so the printing
press is a tool used to make movies and
newspapers does that sound right
newspapers yes the printing press does
make newspapers that's right but does a
printing press make movies no a camera
makes movies right not a printing press
so that's not correct a is not correct
ok
it is a tool but it's and it does make
newspapers but it doesn't make movies ok
the printing press is a machine that's
true a machine remember tool and machine
there's you can sometimes use them in
the same way but remember - a machine is
a specific type of tool it's a complex
more complex than a simple tool a
machine that makes newspapers and books
uh-huh is that true sure the printing
press is a machine it has many complex
parts you turn it on using electricity
some form of N
what does it do it makes newspapers and
books is that true absolutely that is
the correct answer let's look at numbers
see a communication tool that makes
notebooks the printing press is a
communication tool that makes notebooks
that's not right that sounds very
strange it's not a it's not a way to
communicate it's a machine that makes
objects right it's not a tool that
people use to communicate with each
other thank goodness because printing
presses are so big they're very
expensive we wouldn't use them to
communicate with each other right we'd
use them to make objects to make
newspapers and books okay let's take a
look at number four the cellular phone
cellular cellular okay just say cell
phone it's very difficult to say
cellular but that's the full word right
a cell phone and printing press oh
that's interesting we're going to put
them both together the phone and the
printing press what are they what do
they have in common what did that order
that how are they similar let's take a
look a our inventions that help us
communicate is that true the cellular
phone is an invention yeah the printing
press is an invention sure they help us
communicate yeah sure the cellular phone
helps us communicate the printing press
helps us communicate so that's true
right both of these are inventions that
help us communicate okay B were invented
by Johannes Gutenberg that's not true
because Johannes Gutenberg invented the
printing press but he did not invent the
cellular phone in 1448 right that was a
that was too long ago for the cell phone
our machines that we use for writing we
use a cellular phone for writing no
that's not right okay so obviously C and
B are incorrect a is our true answer our
correct answer okay let's take a look at
our chart again we saw this chart before
let's fill it in again these are
communication inventions inventions that
help us communicate so the inventions
that are have to do with communication
in 1876 we have a picture here what was
this invention that was
used to communicate in 1876 do you
remember of course it's called the
telephone telephone was invented in 1876
by Alexander Graham Bell and it was a
way of communicating with each other
right away
remember before the telephone if you
want to talk to your friends or your
parents or your relatives who were far
away you had to write them a letter but
with the telephone you could talk to
them right away through a wire now in
1902 you could get rid of the wire right
no more wires you didn't need a wire
anymore and you could broadcast a
message to many people at the same time
and of course this invention was called
a radio so the radio was invented in
1902 in 1927 what was invented do you
this looks very old doesn't it it's very
old fashioned 1927 of course this was a
way to send not only sound but also
pictures through the air and other
people could pick them up a very
important way to communicate and this of
course was called the television finally
in 1994 it's what we probably use most
of us use it every day some of us use it
too much right don't use it too much but
use it wisely and this of course is a
way to use the Internet this is the
Internet this was the invention of the
internet in 1994 and of course we use
the internet for many many ways of
communicating for talking to people
directly for listening to music for
watching videos we use all of these
different inventions we can use those on
the Internet okay well that wraps it up
for today we've talked about unit 9
changes in communication we've been
talking about how the method of
communication has changed from in the
past to now and especially very
important about the inventions that were
used to help people communicate remember
it's really amazing that we're living in
this time because we have so many
inventions around us and we have so many
inventions that make our life easier and
more fun really so you're living at a
very lucky time in history okay well
anyway that wraps it up for today we'll
see you guys next time take care
everybody
