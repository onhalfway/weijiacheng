==Measuring the Weather==
People can use tools to measure weather. Weather can be measured in many ways. 
One way to measure is to find the temperature of the air. Temperature is the measure of how hot or cold something is. People can use a themometer to measure the temperature of the air. 
People can also measure how much rain has fallen. A rain gauge can be used to measure the amount of rain that has fallen. We can measure the direction and speed of wind. The direction the wind is blowing can be measured by a wind vane. A thermometer, rain gauge, and wind vane are all tools used to measure weather.</p>

hello everybody welcome back to American
textbook reading
I'm Brian Stewart now you remember in
lesson five we were talking about the
weather but in lesson six we're going to
be talking about measuring the weather
so when we observe the weather we can be
more specific and talk about exactly
what the weather is doing so in this
unit you will discover weather can be
measured in many ways there's many ways
to measure the weather and we can see
here this is an instrument to measure
the weather how is it used
well that's another thing we will
discover in this unit okay before we
start to talk about what the
measurements are we need to look at what
does measure mean what does it mean to
measure something there's three things
we can talk about measure means to find
the size size is the first thing speed
speed is the second thing and or amount
amount is the third thing of something
using a tool so measure means to find
the size the speed or the amount of
something using a tool and this of
course here this thing right here is a
tool
what is this tool doing it's measuring
the size of the Apple so size when we
talk about size we can answer the
question how big is it how big is it how
big is this Apple we're talking about
the size speed in this case we're
talking about how fast is it so we use a
different tool to find out how fast
something is so we want to know the
speed here the amount when we talk about
amount in this case
we can ask how much is whoops how much
is there how much is there what's the
amount is there a lot or is there a
little how much is there so three things
one size how big is it to speed how fast
is it three amount how much is there
we use tools to find out the answers to
these questions tools help us observe
things we're observing whether we are
measuring the weather so that's what it
means to measure something now when we
measure things one thing about the
weather we can measure is the
temperature the temperature right so we
can measure the temperature temperature
is how warm or cool something is
remember I taught you that word in unit
five so if we take a look at this chart
right we have two systems for measuring
temperature in Korea we use Celsius in
North America especially America they
use Fahrenheit
these are differences of temperatures
these relate 95 degrees Fahrenheit is 35
degrees Celsius okay so temperature is
how warm or cool something is obviously
this is very warm that's very hot isn't
it if the weather is 35 degrees Celsius
oh that's really hot you're sweating a
lot but if the weather for example is 11
degrees Celsius then that is very cold
right so what's the temperature how warm
or cool something is what do we use to
measure the temperature what is the tool
we use to measure the temperature we
want to know how much of something is
what is the amount what is the amount of
temperature we use a thermometer
thermometer let's repeat that
thermometer a thermometer is a tool you
used to measure the temperature how much
warmth or how little warmth is there
what's the amount in this case Wow it's
very hot
40 degrees right 40 degrees is very hot
this thermometer tells us what the
temperature is if the thermometer swings
over here this of course is the needle
if the needle on the thermometer is over
here it's cool or cold if it comes over
here it's hot so the thermometer lets us
know it helps us measure the temperature
the amount of the temperature let's move
on here we have a rain gauge our rain
gauge is another tool this is a rain
gauge it's a tool our rain gauge is a
tool used to measure how much rain has
fallen how much what are we talking
about how much are we talking about size
are we talking about speed are we
talking about amount how much is there
we're talking about amount how much rain
came down we use a rain gauge and if
this fills up we can see ah that's how
much rain came down it's a rain gauge so
we use that tool to determine how much
of something there is rain gauge in this
case how much rain came down we also use
another tool called a wind vane wind
vane this is an example of a wind vane
it looks like something you'll see on a
farm farmers like this because there are
many chickens or roosters on a farm so
this is a nice or common shape for
American farms will have this type of
wind vane a wind vane is a tool used to
measure the direction the wind is
blowing which way is the wind blowing so
we can also talk about direction right
here we have west east south north so
depending on which way that
rooster is pointing we can see how the
wind is blowing from the West going east
or the wind is coming from the north
it's going south where is the wind
coming from that's the direction of the
wind we can use a wind vane to to
measure that to figure out where is the
wind coming from no that's what I just
talked about Direction what direction
direction is the path of something if
the wind is coming from the west and
going to the east what is the direction
of the wind it's blowing in an easterly
direction in an easterly direction what
is the direction of the wind right what
is the direction of this man he is going
away from us he's not coming towards us
he's going away from us is he going to
go right is he going to go left what
direction is he going in what direction
is something moving in so this is
direction the path of something now blow
we can also use the word blow blow means
to move air through space so the wind
blows if the wind is blowing it is
moving we can measure the direction we
can measure the speed right so when we
talk about blow we're talking about
moving air through some space the wind
is blowing or the wind is not blowing it
is not blowing it is not moving let's
take a look at our chart here we have
measuring the weather we have different
tools we have three different tools on
this chart we have the name of the tool
we have a picture of the tool and we
have what the tool measures what is the
tool used for how do we use the tool
here we have a thermometer a thermometer
this is a picture of a thermometer what
does a thermometer do a thermometer
measures how hot or cold something is so
when we talk about a thermometer we're
talking about is it hot is it cold
we want to know exactly how hot or
exactly how cold it is we use a
thermometer it tells us eggs
actly what we want to know next is a
wind vane a wind vane measures the
direction of the wind so we want to know
what is the direction of the wind where
is the wind blowing in which direction
we can take a look at a video of a wind
vane we have our rooster again let's
take a look at a video let's see how it
moves you can see that wind doesn't
always blow exactly in the same
direction it's moving a lot right so
wind is constantly changing direction
the wind constantly changes direction as
we can see from the wind vane and it
shows us sometimes it's blowing to the
west sometimes it's blowing to the south
and it's going in between these two
directions so the wind has a
southwesterly direction to it of course
it's changing a lot but pretty much
staying between west and south in this
case okay so we can use a wind vane to
measure the direction of the wind coming
back to our chart we have our last tool
here this is a rain gauge this is what a
rain gauge looks like our rain gauge
measures how much rain has fallen so if
it rained a lot yesterday you want to
know how much rain came down yesterday
you use a rain gauge it will fill up
with rain and tell you Oh
it rained about 9 centimeters yesterday
or it rained 20 centimeters yesterday
it's a lot of rain heavy rain came down
so these are three tools that we use to
measure the weather now let's do our
exercise here we have these words here
and we have the definition we need to
match the words with the definitions our
first definition is a tool used to
measure temperature the words are
Direction thermometer rain gauge wind
vane measure and temperature so did you
get it a tool used to measure
temperature
it's a thermometer right we use a
thermometer
to measure the temperature what is the
amount of the temperature as it is what
is the amount of heat right or the
absence of heat is it cold or is it hot
we use a tool the thermometer to measure
temperature that is a thermometer number
two how warm or cool something is now
we're talking about how warm or cool
something is very related to number one
in fact they use the same word
temperature of course so these two are
very closely related if we talk about
how warm something is or how cool
something is we're talking about the
temperature how do we measure
temperature we use a thermometer let's
move on to number three a tool used to
measure the direction the wind is
blowing and remember wind usually
changes directions slightly right so
what was that a tool that we saw in the
video it measures the direction of the
wind that of course is called a wind
vane a wind vane moves and tells us
which direction the wind is blowing in
let's take a look at number four a tool
used to measure how much rain has fallen
so we want to know the amount of rain
that came down yesterday or this morning
at some point what tool is that we use a
rain gauge a rain gauge a gauge is kind
of a tool that measures something it
measures how much rain there is our rain
gauge number five we want to find the
size the speed or the amount of
something using a tool what are we doing
remember that word that we talked about
at the very beginning of this lesson we
are doing something it's a verb we are
measuring something to measure means to
find out to find out exactly using a
tool to find out the size the speed or
the amount how big is it how fast is it
how much is there okay number six the
path of something the path of something
where is it coming from where is it
going
what is
the direction okay I can't say that
without giving you the word what is the
direction of something what is the path
of something path and direction are very
similar
what is the path what is the direction
is the direction East is the path going
east what's the direction by the way we
can say north south west east those are
directions we can also say straight
ahead right left or go behind you those
are also directions too so we can use
lots of words to talk about direction
okay let's take a look at this chart
here this chart is saying who studies
the weather so when we're talking about
the weather and especially when we're
talking about measuring the weather we
can talk about a person whose job it is
it's their job to study the weather they
measure the weather all the time and
they want to know what the weather is
doing who do we call those what do we
call those people we call them a
meteorologist that's a little bit of a
long word isn't it it's a little hard to
pronounce meteorologists meteorologists
so one more time meteorologists it's
kind of a difficult word a meteorologist
is a scientist a scientist who studies
the weather meteorologists
meteorologists tell us what the weather
will be like tomorrow
they give us a forecast right I talked
about that before in unit 5
a forecast is predicting they are making
a prediction a prediction about the
weather they study the weather what the
weather is doing and they have a lot of
knowledge about what weather patterns
are like so they can predict the weather
they can guess what the weather is going
to do in the future that's a prediction
a guess about the future and from those
guesses they can give us a report about
the weather in the future and that is a
forecast they tell us what the weather
will be like tomorrow that's tomorrow's
or caste it's a prediction that
meteorologists make when they study the
weather this guy looks like he's
studying a hurricane which is a weather
form he's studying how fast the speed of
the wind and also very important the
direction where is that storm going to
go because then he can tell people in
that area to be careful
so meteorologists have very important
jobs ok let's take a look at these
different pictures we're looking at the
tools that are used in each picture and
we want to know what each tool measures
so in the first picture we have a
picture what is this thing now this is
different from what we saw before this
is a tool that will move according to
what according to the wind direction so
if you chose the wind direction that's
true it's not measuring rainfall it's
measuring the direction of the wind I'd
like to point out something here too
this right here this part of the tool
that is measuring how fast the wind is
going so this tool actually has two
parts this part measures the direction
what is the direction whoops what is the
direction of the wind and this part
measures the speed how fast is the wind
so that's interesting this is a more
modern looking wind vane and has two
parts it measures the direction the wind
and this part here spins fast if the
wind is fast it spins slowly or not at
all if the wind is very slow so it
measures direction and speed of the wind
so let's take a look here this next part
number two this is a instrument for
measuring what it shows us the amount of
something the amount of what rainfall or
wind speed well of course it's measuring
rainfall how much rain fell during a
certain period this is a rain gauge okay
this is a rain gauge
number three what is this here first of
all what is it measuring is it measuring
wind direction or temperature you can
see there's two sides we have Celsius
which is a system used in Korea and most
of the world and Fahrenheit which is the
system used just basically in America so
what is it measuring is it measuring
wind direction or temperature well if
you chose temperature you are correct
what is this called thermometer
thermometer so let's review this is a
wind vane it measures wind direction
this is a rain gauge it measures
rainfall this is a thermometer it
measures temperature okay let's move on
to our true/false questions so Circle T
for true F for false first one people
use a thermometer to measure the
temperature of the air so we're using a
thermometer to measure temperature
remember these words are very closely
related and that's true absolutely we
use a thermometer to measure the
temperature temperature is how hot or
how cold something is we want to know
what the air temperature is how hot is
the air how cool or cold is the air we
use a thermometer to figure that out
to measure it number two people use a
wind vane to measure the speed of wind
so a wind vane that's interesting do we
use a wind vane that moves with the
direction of the wind to measure the
speed of wind no we don't we use a
different tool now that tool that I
showed you had two parts right the top
part was the wind vane that showed us
the direction of the wind that's the
wind vane but the pot impart that spins
around that's not a wind vane that's
just a that's a different part of the
tool it's not the wind vane part the
wind vane moves according to the
direction of the wind
but it doesn't tell us the speed of the
wind okay just shows us the direction of
the wind number three our rain gauge can
be used to measure which direction the
wind is blowing
so a rain gauge can be used to measure
the direction the wind no because we
just saw in number two that a wind vane
is used to measure the direction of the
wind not a rain gauge so that's false if
we change this to wind vane it would be
correct
a wind vane so a wind vane can measure
the direction of the wind which
direction is the wind blowing we use a
wind vane to show us and of course so
that we have to change the sentence that
sentence is false not true okay well
let's take a break here let's move on to
the reading section okay welcome back
let's go over the reading now this
article is going to be talking about
measuring the weather and especially
about the tools used to measure the
weather we can see that in the first
sentence people can use tools to measure
whether that's our topic sentence our
subject is here tools and we measure we
use those tools to measure the weather
remember we can measure things in many
different ways
weather can be measured in many ways
we're talking about size speed and
amount and of course we're talking about
that here one way to measure is to find
the temperature of the air the amount of
heat or the absence of heat that's the
temperature of the air how hot is it how
cold is it temperature is the measure of
how hot or cold something is so how hot
is it how cold is it we're talking about
temperature what do we use to measure
the temperature what is the tool used to
measure the temperature well people can
use a thermometer to measure the
temperature of the air so this is the
tool that we use to measure the
temperature another thing we can measure
is how much rain has fallen people can
also measure how much rain has fallen so
how much how much rain what is the
amount how much rain has fallen our rain
gauge is the tool that we
Jews to measure the amount of rain that
has fallen here we see the example we
see the picture again of how much rain
has fallen if it's full that's a lot of
rain fell but if it's very little not
very much rain fell so we can measure
that right how much of an amount how
much has fallen okay we can also measure
the direction and the speed of the wind
not only can we measure the direction we
can also measure how fast is the wind
what is the speed of that wind the
direction the wind is blowing
remember wind blows moves from one place
to another air moves it's blowing the
direction can be measured by a wind vane
okay this is a good video of another
wind vane we can see it in action here
let's see how it's moving you can hear
the wind can't you it's really blowing
now this part of the machine over here
is a wind vane it's showing us the
direction in which the wind is blowing
okay so this part is the wind vane now
we talked about this tool over here
that's used to measure the speed of the
wind
it is not a wind vane what is it well
let's spell it out here a n e m o
R and then anemometer and a monitor
anemometer it's a little difficult of a
word to say and a monitor so an
anemometer is the tool that we use to
measure the speed of the wind how fast
is the wind going and you saw that
little thing spinning around if it spins
faster the wind speed is higher if it's
been slower the wind speed is slower so
this is the anemometer and this is the
wind vane okay so let's do a little bit
of summary we're talking about the
different tools that are used to measure
the wind the weather now we have three
tools that we talked about one first we
talked about the thermometer that's the
first tool we talked about the second
was the rain gauge and the
was the wind vane wind vane so one two
three this is kind of a summary
statement we're wrapping up these tools
one thermometer two rain gauge three
wind vane they are all tools used to
measure the weather how hot is it
how much rain fell what's the direction
of the wind these are all tools we use
to measure the weather so we can break
down our reading passage into this type
of skill main idea in details right
we're talking about tools what are the
tools used for for measuring the weather
and we can talk about what each tool is
used for specifically what exactly are
we measuring so our topic sentence
weather can be measured in many ways
there's many different ways we can
divide three different areas or three
different ways that were measuring the
weather first of all we have the first
way the second way and the third way
remember I showed you on the summary
slide we need to fill in the blanks here
with these words at the bottom first
word or first phrase rain gauge rain
gauge temperature wind vane and
thermometer so we have four choices at
the bottom let's fill them in a it's
missing so we need to continue on the
sentence is the measure of how hot or
cold something is okay
so the measure of how hot or cold it is
we are talking about what we're talking
about the temperature right temperature
is the measure of how hot or how cold it
is temperature what do we use as a tool
to meant to measure the temperature
something is a tool for measuring it the
temperature so what do we use to measure
the temperature that's over here isn't
it we use a thermometer a thermometer is
a tool that we use to measure how hot or
cold it is that's the same as saying to
the temperature the second one we talked
about in the reading passage we can
measure how much rain has fallen what do
we use for that we use of course a rain
gauge we use a rain gauge to find out
how much rain has fallen
finally the direction of wind can be
measured by what do we use a rain gauge
no temperature no a wind vane yes
when vane tells us the direction of the
wind so we use a wind vane to tell us to
measure the direction which way the wind
is blowing okay let's talk about the
reading comprehension questions number
one a meteorologist write difficult word
meteorologist is someone who studies the
what remember we talked about
meteorologists we saw a picture of
somebody he was looking at the computer
screens what was he studying was he
studying people weather or tools of
course the the subject of our unit is
weather so if you chose whether you're
correct but it's true a meteorologist
studies whether they don't study people
they don't study tools they use tools to
study the weather especially to measure
the weather and make predictions about
the weather okay let's move on to number
two temperature is the measure of how
beep something is so we have a choice is
warm or cool be wet see fast temperature
is a measure of how warm or cool
something is that's correct isn't it our
choice is a B temperature is a measure
of how wet something is no we're talking
about perhaps humidity right humidity
would tell us how wet something is humid
if T if we talk about the humidity we
can talk about how wet the air is how
wet some area or region is if it has
high humidity it's wet not a lot of
humidity it's dry so that would be
humidity not temperature fast no fast
would be speed
so we'd have to change that to speed
right speed is the measure of how fast
something is right that would be correct
so we would have to change this word
with these for these two to be correct
so temperature we're talking about warm
or cool how warm or cool something is
let's move on to number three our rain
gauge can measure how much rain has
fallen now here we have the next part of
the sentence some start one of them
starts with but two of them starts with
and that's important
let's take a look our rain gauge can
measure how much rain has fallen but on
the other hand in the opposite way it
cannot measure temperature is that true
a rain gauge measures how much rain has
fallen that's true but it can't measure
temperature that is true so a is our
correct answer what about B and it can
also measure wind direction so it can it
can measure how much rain has fallen and
also wind direction
no rain gauge is only used for one thing
how much rain has fallen it can't also
measure wind direction right and notice
it uses an so that means also but this
one uses but so it cannot do that it can
only do one thing C and measures the
same as a thermometer no it doesn't
measure the temperature it doesn't
measure how hot or cold something is so
C is not correct either a is our correct
choice on number for some tools used to
measure the weather our so we're talking
about the names of different tools what
are some tools that we use to measure
the weather a do we use a meteorologist
and a scientist to measure the weather
can we use those people hey come here I
want to use you to measure the weather
that sounds really weird right another
problem is a meteorologist and a
scientist it's the same thing
that's like saying we use a ruler and a
ruler to measure how long something is
it's the same thing we don't need to
repeat so a is not our correct answer B
a wind vane and a thermometer so
one tool is a wind vane another tool is
a thermometer is that true we can use a
wind vane and a thermometer to measure
the weather sure that's what we're
talking about in this unit these are
some tools we use to measure the weather
so B is the correct answer C we use
rainfall temperature and wind speed are
these tools they're not tools they're
things that we measure about the weather
there are things about the weather that
we do measure but they are not tools so
they can't be the right answer either B
of course is our correct answer okay
let's move on to our last slide showing
the chart that we saw before these are
three different tools we just talked
about what are some tools that we use to
measure the weather so here we have the
picture and here we have the description
we need to fill in the labels we have a
picture here of something that measures
how hot or cold something is you're
measuring the temperature what do you
use to measure the temperature you use a
thermometer this is a picture of a
thermometer in the second part we have a
tool here that measures the direction of
the wind this thing turns and shows us
the direction the wind is blowing what
is it called it's called a wind vane
shows us the direction of the wind
finally we have a picture of a tool here
that's used to measure how much rain has
fallen this tool measures how much rain
has fallen what is it it of course is a
rain gauge so we have three different
tools that we use to measure the weather
so in this unit we looked at a lot of
different tools how do we measure the
weather we can look outside and say it's
rainy it's snowy or it's aw it looks
like a clear day looks like a warm day
but we want to know exactly how hot it
is exactly how cold it is exactly how
much rain has fallen how much wind is
blowing and what direction in this case
we use tool
we saw different types of tools that we
can use to measure the weather and
remember a meteorologist is someone who
studies the weather he or she uses these
tools to make predictions about the
weather so it's a very interesting
lesson hope you've learned a lot as
usual we'll see you next time take care
