== Land and Water ==
The Earth has many different shapes. There are many different kinds of land. At the end of land, there are many cliffs. A cliff is a high, steep part of land. A mountain is the highest kind of land. It is very steep. A hill is a high area of land; it is smaller than a mountain. Valleys and plains are low lands. A valley is a low land between mountains. A plain is a flat area of land. There are not many trees on a plain. A river is a large moving piece of water. A stream is a small river. Streams usually start at a mountain and finish at a beach. A lake is a large area of water.</p>

hello everybody and welcome back to
American textbook reading I'm your host
Brian Stewart in this lesson we're going
to be talking about earth science and
this is an interesting topic for me
because my dad is a geologist a
geologist my father is a G although just
in Korean you say G jalaja right okay so
my dad is a geologist and I grew up you
know learning from my dad as well and
it's a very important subject of course
talking about earth science in this
lesson lesson seven we'll be talking
about land and water so in this lesson
you will discover different features of
land features that's an interesting word
features are like characteristics if I
talk about my face I could say I have
different features on my face nose eyes
mouth if we look at land there are many
different features mountains valleys
Plains these are different features of
the land well let's take a look at some
of these different features first of all
let's take a look at one interesting
feature it's a river this is a good
picture of a river rivers can be all
very wide right especially the
Mississippi River in America is really
wide Mississippi can you say that
quickly Mississippi the Mississippi
River is very wide
sometimes rivers are smaller narrower
but they all have one thing in common
and that is the water in a river is
moving if the water is not moving it's a
lake we'll talk about that a little bit
but a river is a long moving piece of
water so the key word here is moving if
the water is moving it is a river if
it's not moving it's not a river it's
something else
so a river is a long piece of water that
is moving
moving along sometimes it's very fast
and is dangerous you got to be careful
but sometimes it's slowly moving along
and it's very beautiful very scenic okay
as I said before if the water in a lake
the water in a river especially a wide
river is not moving then we call it a
lake right a lake is a large area of
water a lake is smaller than an ocean
this is a small lake looks like it's in
the mountains very beautiful picturesque
Lake and of course this water will
probably be very clear and good to drink
probably too it's high up in the
mountains right it's a nice little lake
this is a small lake sometimes lakes are
really big so big you can't see across
them but lakes are a large area of water
and another important feature about
Lakes lakes have fresh fresh water okay
so you can drink it
okay so lakes have fresh water okay
let's move on to the next feature the
next feature we're talking about is
mountain we saw a mountain just just
before we saw the lake in the mountains
right but we can also just look at the
mountains as a feature of land a
mountain what is a mountain a mountain
is the highest kind of land if you think
about that where is the highest place on
earth
if you guessed Mountain M T stands for
mountain Mount Everest Mount Everest is
the highest place on land it's in the
Himalayas between China and India right
in the Himalayan mountains okay a
mountain is the highest kind of land a
mountain is very steep steep is a good
word steep means it has a very strong
angle going up like this if you look at
the mountains they're very steep that
means it's very hard to climb them right
sometimes you have to climb them like
this you have to climb the mountains
because they're very steep the angle
their sides are very they go up very
quickly they are
beep mountains okay another feature of
the land is a plane now we can see
planes in many areas what are some
features of the planes well of course
one feature is that it's flat right and
well that's what we have here a plane is
a flat land it's a flat area of land a
very flat piece of land there are not
many trees on a plane we talked about
forests before right but on a plane you
don't have many trees if you have many
trees that's a different feature that's
a forest right that's a different type
of habitat for animals but a plane is a
large flat piece of land with no trees
in the middle of America the Great
Plains many Buffalo used to roam on the
plains very wide open you can see for a
very far distance and a long time ago
you could see great huge herds of
animals on these Plains and in Africa
too when you go to the plains you can
see many animals roaming around on the
plains but the two features flat not
many trees and usually you have a lot of
grass that the animals can eat that's a
plane also we have hill or a hill or
Hills right
Akil is a high area of land but it's not
a mountain right Hills are small right
mountains are very large so a hill is a
higher area of land if you have a plane
that's very flat but sometimes a land
will come up like this and sometimes we
call gentle gentle rolling hills that's
a very nice feature of land gentle
rolling hills that's where the land is
just very gentle going up and down like
the wave on an ocean but of course these
waves don't move right because they're
Hills they don't move they stay like
this and these hills are just a higher
piece of land above the plains or above
the flat land a hill is a higher area of
land a hill is of course is smaller than
a mountain right if you look at
something and say wow that's
that's a mountain somebody might say you
call that a mountain that's a hill right
because they don't think it's very high
right it's not that high so it's a hill
okay let's move on a cliff now a cliff
can be dangerous be careful right here
it says a cliff is a high steep part of
the land we can also say a cliff is a
sudden drop or a sudden rise in the land
it depends on where you're coming from
if you're coming from this direction the
cliff is a sudden drop right so be
careful right but if you're coming from
this way then the cliff is a sudden rise
a sudden rise in the land so a cliff can
be a sudden drop a sudden drop or rise
rise this way in the land a sudden drop
or rise in the land and that's what a
cliff is cliffs can be dangerous but
also cliffs can sometimes be fun but be
careful when you're when you're with
cliff so we're gonna see a little video
here here's a bunch of young men boys
perhaps on top of a cliff what are they
doing up there they just looking around
let's see what they're doing oh my gosh
oh my gosh okay there's water at the
bottom of the cliff this is very
dangerous of course be careful if you do
this be careful don't jump off cliffs
unless you know that there's water
underneath and there's enough water that
will catch you and you won't hit the
bottom when you hit that water right
this guy's you know this guy's very
brave right but be very careful when you
if you do this type of activity right
but it's very fun looks exciting right
be very careful okay let's move on
valleys valleys are also a good feature
of the land very beautiful feature of
the land especially in for example
Switzerland or some places in Europe
here this looks like perhaps the
American West or some parts of Asia here
we have the plains on the top right the
land is kind of flat we have some hills
in the background but all of a sudden
you have the drop and these are cliffs
on the side and at the bottom we would
say this is a valley a valley is the
lowland between mountains or Hills well
you could say that these could be
mountains I guess it's kind of like a
plane going along here and then sudden
we have cliffs and then the valley is at
the bottom the valley is the lowland at
the bottom of the of the cliffs and
valleys of course are we find them
typically of course in mountains you
know between one mountain and another
mountain also between hills some valleys
can be very beautiful right you have
lots of trees you usually have a river
running through the valley because the
river is what created the valley the
water cut through and that's all very
obvious in this picture the water
actually cut through the ground and made
this valley so that's a very interesting
feature of the land okay another feature
of the land is a stream now we've
already talked about rivers right rivers
are very big they're very wide but
streams are very narrow
you could probably step across a stream
right you could probably step from one
side to the other but some streams are a
little bit wider you can't step across
but a small river is we call those
streams now streams and rivers usually
come from the mountains right so then
the mountains of course has water high
up on the on the mountains the water has
to come down from the mountains so if
there's a lot of water our River comes
down but if there's only a little bit of
water then a stream will come down so
streams usually come from mountains and
also rivers usually come from mountains
okay so we've learned a lot of good
words about features of the land some
ways to describe the land and how do we
describe these different features well
now that we've learned these words let's
move on and let's do a little bit of
review with some exercises we have our
words here what we need to do match each
word with its definition so these will
be definitions and these are the words
that we have to match to these different
definitions let's start with number one
a high area of land which is smaller
than a
okay so we've talked about that before
it's a higher area of land but it's not
as high as a mountain it's not that big
remember when I talked about somebody
who said wow that's a mountain and the
other person said you call that a
mountain that's not a mountain it's a
hill it's a hill and that's our word
right over here Hill okay so a higher of
land which is smaller than a mountain we
call that a hill okay so what one person
might call a mountain if one person
lives in the plains and they don't see
many Hills or mountains they might come
to a place and say wow look at that
mountain it's just a small hill the
other persons from the mountains would
say that's not a mountain that's just a
hill so it's not as big as a mountain
okay number two a flatland not having
many trees so a flat area of land not
many trees on it usually there's grass
on it and what do we call that type of
land we call that of course a plane that
is a plain flat land not many trees
maybe a few trees but usually grass
growing on the land you can see for
really far
those are Plains three the highest kind
of land the highest kind of land
remember Mount Everest right which is
very steep and Mount Everest is very
steep you have to be a very skilled
mountain climber to climb up Mount
Everest and I gave you the answer right
there of course it's Mountain you have
to be a skilled mountain climber to
climb up to some very high mountains
okay so Mountain let's move on to four
five and six four five and six here we
have number for a long moving piece of
water remember the key word is moving
right it is moving the water is moving
along and it's a long moving piece of
water then we call that we call that of
course a river which is over here that
is a river number five we say a high
steep part of the land a high steep part
line also remember I talked to you guys
about that it depends if you're on top
and you come to it it's a sudden drop or
if you're at the bottom you come along
and hit the bottom or it's a rise in the
land what do we call that that's a cliff
and we saw those boys jumping off the
cliff
right make sure there's water on the
bottom of the cliff before you jump
don't jump off cliffs it can be
dangerous
okay number six a large area of water
which is smaller than an ocean so a
large area of water smaller than an
ocean or a sea and it's usually
freshwater right what do we call that we
call that a lake
remember if water is not moving and it's
a large piece of water that's a lake
right but if it's moving then it's a
river okay let's move on we have a nice
chart here that shows the two different
categories I guess of features of land
we can categorize these features into
two main groups one is land and one is
water so let's take a look over here
starting with land what kinds of
features on land can we find well of
course first of all we have a mountain
up here and this is a very impressive
looking mountain isn't it it's very tall
very steep it's got a nice shape to it
looks like it's covered in snow
because mountains of course are the
highest areas of land they're very high
in the air it's colder up there so snow
will collect up there okay so this is a
good example of a mountain
next we have a hill here this looks like
a little sign right there in the hill
but a hill of course is just a higher
part of the land you have the flat land
here and then a slight rise that's a
hill so somebody who's living you know
who lives out in the plains and they
don't see many hills or mountains they
may come to a large hill
and they might say wow look at the
mountain and then somebody who's next to
that person might say and they're from
you know somebody who's from the
mountains who's next to that person
might say you call that a mountain
that's just a hill right so you know
Hills could be mountains to some people
but just Hills to other people depends
on where you're from of course if it's
very small it's very obvious it's just a
hill okay let's move on down around our
chart here over here we have a plane now
this is an interesting looking plane
actually it looks like a farmer has
planted some type of crop on this plane
we could also call that a field in that
case a farmer will plant crops in a
field right but planes in field
are very similar so another word in this
case that we could use is a field and a
field a farmer will come along find a
nice plain and plant crops and then we
call it a field but let's take a look at
a video of a plain in nature a natural
plain that hasn't been touched let's
take a look this is a picture of a plane
that hasn't really been touched by a
farmer you can see the light is changing
from a dark to light that's because the
clouds are moving over the Sun but
that's a very good example of a plane
it's a very nice and peaceful looking
place of course it's flat as we saw not
many trees grow on the plane I mean if
we go over here there's trees over there
but that's not playing anymore that we
call that forest but this open area we
call a plane and you can see a lot of
grass is another common feature on
planes animals will will lead the grass
and usually we'll see large groups of
animals here and there on the plains you
know for example cows horses deer those
types of animals especially if you go to
Africa you'll see a lot of wild groups
of animals right like wildebeest or are
zebras right running around on the
plains and they eat the grass and of
course behind them come to lions right
okay okay let's move on in our chart fur
for land here we have Valley Valley of
course is another feature of land and a
valley is a low area of land between
mountains or Hills usually there's a
river at the bottom of a valley let's
take a look at a video of a valley this
is a video this looks like actually I
think this is the Grand Canyon and the
Grand Canyon of course Nazaire in
Arizona my parents live near near the
Grand Canyon they're not very far so
I've been to the Grand Canyon a few
times this looks like part of the Grand
Canyon
I'm not sure exactly where where this is
but and the bottom of the Grand Canyon
you see a stream a river actually by the
way I was using another word did you
catch it
Canyon which is another feature of land
now a canyon you can also say
the valley is down here but a canyon we
can also say this is a good example of
Canyon of course the Grand Canyon is
very famous world famous but you can see
these cliffs it's just a really
impressive very amazing Canyon this
River actually cut through the land over
millions of years to make this valley
this Canyon coming through and it's a
very dry area in this case it's in the
desert so it's very beautiful especially
when the Sun rises and the Sun sets it
the light changes these cliffs to many
different colors of orange and red and
pink very beautiful okay but this is a
good example of a valley or in this case
a canyon as well this is also a good
example of a canyon usually for a valley
we'll say you know it's a little bit
more gentle right that it's not so steep
and there's a lot of greenery around and
then I would say that that's more of a
valley but a canyons are kind of a
special type of Valley especially find
them in the desert where the river the
water has cut the the land and left a
lot of cliffs okay let's move on okay
now we're talking about different types
of water features on the land here we
have a stream and right before remember
I talked about a stream usually you can
step across a stream or you could
probably maybe jump across this stream
right it's different from a river a
river which is very wide you couldn't
step across this river and I don't think
you could jump across this river either
but anyway we have a nice video of a
stream let's take a look at a video of a
stream to get a better idea this looks
like a nice stream here right you can
see the water moving along oh there's a
nice little bridge because this stream
is a little a little hard to jump over a
step over but you'll notice also streams
they're not that deep right you could
walk across the rocks here if you wanted
to and that's a nice stream actually
this stream it makes me think of going
fishing right if we had a couple fishing
poles right we could go fishing for fish
in these deep pools along the stream but
of course streams are moving water we
can see the water that is moving over
these rocks okay and of course that's
different from a river which is very
wide and rivers are usually deeper you
couldn't really cross
the river on rocks because the rivers
are deeper and rivers are moving a lot
faster if they're narrow and it's
dangerous to cross the river so be very
careful and of course sometimes rivers
are very wide they might be slow-moving
but then you still you'd have to swim
across the river you couldn't walk
across it or use rocks to jump across
the river okay let's move on down here
we have a ocean is also a feature it's
that has to do with water and if you're
standing on the side of an ocean of
course it's very wide you can't see the
other side and oceans are usually
saltwater very big a body of water most
of the earth is covered in oceans okay
and that is of course opposed to a lake
you can see the difference really and an
ocean you can't see the other side but
usually most lakes you can see the other
side there are exceptions of course
especially the Great Lakes in in America
between America and Canada those lakes
are so big you can't see across the
other side it's like an ocean but we
still call them lakes why because
they're freshwater so we call those
Lakes the Great Lakes so lakes are
usually freshwater and we have a good
video of a lake here here's a video we
can see the water now remember I said
Lakes the water doesn't move but hey the
water is moving but this water is not
flowing from a higher place to a lower
place what's going on is the wind it is
pushing the water on the top it looks
like the waters moving and it is moving
but just on the surface right the water
on this side of the lake is not flowing
to this side of the lake that's not
what's going on if it was that would be
a river this water's staying put it's
not going anywhere
right but the wind is pushing the top of
the water along it looks like it's
moving but the lakes the water usually
stays here now of course there might be
a stream that comes into the lake there
might be another stream that goes out of
the lake and maybe some of the water is
moving but most of this water this body
of water is staying put it doesn't move
it doesn't flow from one place to
another and we call that a lake okay so
two kinds of water on earth there and we
talked about that a little bit already
right we've talked about salt water
we've talked about freshwater let's take
a little bit more a closer look at each
in more detail when we talk about
saltwater we're talking of course about
an ocean an ocean is made up of
saltwater so like I said before oceans
cover most of the earth most of the
earth is covered in saltwater
now many living things cannot drink
saltwater if we go to the ocean we can't
drink this water Wow
it'll taste bad and it will make us sick
so we can't drink saltwater and we
shouldn't drink saltwater we can play in
it we can swim in it we can dive and
look down in it fish live in it coral
grows in saltwater but we cannot drink
it and that's an important feature of
saltwater
however fresh water we can drink fresh
water is water without salt there's no
salt in this water many living things
can drink fresh water so we can drink
the water in rivers and lakes however I
would not drink the water from a river
that runs through a city because there's
no salt in this water but there might be
other things like some pollution or
runoff or some things that the people in
the city you know is going in the water
so don't drink that water but it is
fresh water usually this water has to be
treated has to run through a water
treatment plant so that we can drink it
streams rivers and lakes are freshwater
if you go into the mountains or you get
away from cities you go out into the
country and you see a stream or a river
you might be able to drink that water
but always be careful about drinking
water in the wild because sometimes
there might be some bacteria or bugs in
that water that could make you sick so
be careful ask people is this water safe
to drink
is this water safe to drink ok but
usually fresh water or we can people can
drink it animals of course can drink it
and animals don't have to worry about
those types of things they just go down
they drink the water ok
so let's review a little bit with some
true/false questions you
the sentence is true we Circle T if it's
false we Circle F number one a lake is
larger than an ocean true or false
obviously it is false because Lakes as
we said before Lakes are smaller than
oceans I said the Great Lakes in America
yeah they're very big you can't see
across them but all of those Lakes none
of those lakes are as big as the
Atlantic Ocean and certainly not as big
as the Pacific Ocean right so oceans are
bigger than lakes lakes are smaller
number two there are many trees on a
plane is that true or false if you chose
false you are correct there that the
idea of a plane is that there are not
many trees if there are many trees then
we call it a forest it's not a plane
anymore right a plane usually has grass
right growing on it but not trees we can
see for a very long distance on a plane
if there are many trees we can't see for
a very long ways ok so number three a
cliff is a high flat part of the land
now this is an interesting idea here a
cliff is a high high flat part of the
land no how can it be high and flat flat
means like you know from side to side so
a cliff is a high flat part of the land
that's that it has to be false right
because it's not flat it's vertical ok
vertical is different from flat veux-tu
coal vertical goes up and down here I'll
draw it over here up and down that's
vertical flat is this way we can also
say flat there's another word we can use
and that is horizon-- tall let's
practice those two words first we have
vertical up and down then we have
horizontal flat ok a cliff is not
horizontal a cliff is vertical so this
is not correct a cliff is a high higher
sudden drop in the land it's a sudden
drop or a sudden run
in the land that's a cliff so it's false
they're all false false false false okay
so a little a little review there okay
well let's take an intermission here and
then we'll get into the reading part in
just a little bit okay everybody welcome
back it's time to go over the reading
section so let's read a short passage
about the concepts and the ideas that
we've just studied about of course we're
continuing on the theme of land and
water this passage has to do with land
the first sentence the earth has many
different shapes
oh yeah the earth has many different
shapes it has many different features
there are many different parts of the
land and we talked about a lot of those
different types of land those features
of the land and that's there are many
different kinds of land so actually
these two sentences are very very
similar in meaning they're almost the
same really the earth has many different
shapes or features and there are many
different kinds of land as we have
discovered right in so we're gonna talk
about this passage is gonna be talking
about different types of land
classifying you know different types of
land and describing what makes those
types of land unique and different from
each other so at the first one we're
talking about cliffs at the end of land
there are many cliffs
well not all land of course at the end
of some land I mean you don't always
have this you know sometimes you have a
shallow it comes down to a beach but at
the end of some land when it goes into
the ocean right you have a cliff and a
cliff again is a sudden drop or a sudden
rise depending on your direction right a
cliff is a high steep part of the land
remember we talked about steep and I
also taught you about vertical steep and
vertical steep and vertical aren't the
same steep can also be like this right
steep can also be like this but vertical
is up-and-down this is obviously
vertical this is very dangerous too
be careful lady right don't get too
close to the edge okay so those are
cliffs and cliffs are very scenic as we
can see a mountain is the next type of
land that we're going to talk about a
mountain is the highest kind of land
it's the highest part of the land that
you can get to by climbing or walking or
climbing usually it is very steep okay
so steep remember you can see the sides
of the mountain there very steep they go
up very sharply okay a hill is another
type of land but it's a high area of
land however it is smaller than a
mountain so we can see it's a higher
right it's a higher part of the land
it's not as steep remember I taught you
gentle rolling hills this is a very
gentle slope this is a very steep slope
and also Hills are very small right
especially compared to these mountains
which are very very high by the way I
want to point out one thing this is an
interesting punctuation mark this right
here is a semicolon why did we use a
semicolon whoops that's not an e sorry
I'll cross that out
semi colon I meant to draw a C semicolon
a semicolon is used here this is a
complete sentence this is one sentence
right but this is also another sentence
these are two sentences that are
complete independent of each other right
we could just put a period here and bid
it capital I and have a new sentence and
that would be fine but we use a
semicolon to join two complete sentences
that are closely connected and meaning a
hill is a high area of land that's one
thing about a hill
another thing about a hill is that it is
smaller than a mountain so these two
sentences are very closely connected
they both describe a hill and they are
very closely connected also in their
construction the way that they are are
written so we can use a semicolon to
connect those two sentences sometimes
you will see that okay so a semicolon
can be used to connect two complete
sentences it's a good example okay let's
move on okay
valleys and Plains those are other types
of land other features of lands of land
there are lowlands right usually of
course they are lower land than the
surrounding hills or mountains a valley
is a low area of land or
land between mountains like this it's a
low area of course these are higher
areas the valley is lower so Valley is a
low land between mountains and between
hills as well we talked about a plane a
plane is a flat area of land as we can
see here there are not many trees on the
land so the two features of the plane
that they're talking about one it is
flat - there are not many trees on the
plane so two features of the land okay
of the plane here okay let's move on
another feature of the land is a river
now remember what we talked about a
river what makes a river unique
different from for example a stream it's
large it's large what makes a river
different or unique from a lake it's
moving so large moving piece of water
our River is a large piece of water that
is moving and it is large okay of course
a stream is a small river streams and
rivers are very similar but just
remember streams are smaller narrower
rivers are wider larger streams usually
start at a mountain and finish at a
beach of course we can also say rivers
also usually start at a mountain and
finish at a beach okay
it's a very interesting area by the way
if you're at the coast if you're by the
ocean and you see a river coming out or
through the land and across the beach
the water is flowing that's a very
interesting place to be because you've
got the fresh water coming out of the
mountains meeting the saltwater in the
ocean it's very interesting okay a lake
is another type or feature of the land a
lake is a large area of water as we saw
but remember a lake is not as big as an
ocean okay so we have the three
different types of land we're talking
about here pictured here a river a
stream and a lake okay okay now we've
come to our reading skill and our
reading skill here is to classify and
the reading passage we just studied is a
good example or a good case study for
the classification skill because the
reading passage was
talking about different shapes of land
or different features of the land and we
take a look at a group of things and we
say they're different they're unique we
can classify them meaning we can put
them into different groups according to
their unique features or their unique
definitions so over here we have the
different features of the land cliff
mountain hill beep we have to figure
that out and plane those are the
different features and we can classify
them according to their definition right
how do we define them and these are the
definitions here
well let's of course start with a we
have to put a word in here our words are
down here mountain steep flat valley
highest now we already know that this
word is going to be a feature of the
land so we have here mountain is a
feature of a land valley so really our
only two choices are between mountain
and valley because only those two words
would fit in the types or shapes or
features of the land right so let's take
a look what is the definition of this
mystery word the definition is it is a
lowland
between two mountains so the lowland
between two mountains right we talked
about that before
is that a mountain no a mountain is low
land between two mountains that doesn't
make sense so a valley right valley is a
lowland between two mountains so a of
course is Valley right that's our choice
there let's move on to B jump back up
we're talking about a cliff that is our
feature of the land our definition a
cliff is a high beep kind of land now
what word goes here of course you're not
going to use mountain or Valley those
are those belong over here so we need to
choose between steep flat or highest
right of course steep would be the best
choice here it is a high steep kind of
land a cliff in fact cliffs are usually
vertical right vertical remember is as a
type of steep steep can be vertical or
steep can be you know not vertical but
very sharper or very strong slope or
very difficult slope so steep can be
anywhere from maybe 45 degrees to 90
degrees 90 degrees of
horse is vertical up and down so steep
cliff so always have to be up and down
cliffs can be like this too right okay
so as a high steep kind of land that is
a cliff what about mountain mountain it
is the BEP kind of land it is the where
to use steep flat kind of land mountains
are flat or the highest I think we
should use highest here it is the
highest kind of land so if you chose
highest you're correct right mountains
are the highest kind of land we use the
example of Mount Everest which is the
highest point on earth right the highest
kind of land a hill it is a high area of
land yes it is smaller than a beep okay
what are heel smaller than right we
talked about that a lot right you might
see a hill it might be a large Hill you
know hills can be small you can also
have large Hills but Hills are always
smaller than a mountain right I feel
it's smaller than a mountain and Hills
are usually not as steep as a mountain
that's another distinction sometimes it
can be you know sometimes Hills can have
steep sides but usually they're not
there they're they're more gentle
usually but they are smaller than
mountains okay we talked about Valley
already let's go down to plane this is
our last one f it plane it is a beep
area of land there are not many trees on
it so when we were talking about planes
we said there are two main features of
the planes right one it didn't have many
trees on it right
the other part it is flat right it is a
flat area of land so it's flat it
doesn't rise it's horizontal it's a
horizontal piece of land it is a flat
area of land ok let's move on with some
comprehension questions the first one
here a valley is a lowland between a
rivers B planes or C mountains we just
talked about this right on the previous
side slide we saw that a valley is a
lowland between mountains
you could also say or Hills right
because we have valleys between Hills
too but any time when the land is high
on both sides and you have a low area of
land
we call that a valley okay and we also
talked about Canyon before it's a
special kind of valley okay number two a
stream is like a what a small river a
small mountain or a high cliff well if
you chose a small River you're right
because we talked about that a lot right
a stream is smaller narrower than a
river a river is wider than a stream so
a stream is like a small river not a
small mountain and not a high cliff okay
so a stream is like a small river okay
let's move on to three and four at the
end of land and remember it's not at the
end of all land it's at the end of some
land there are cliffs which are so this
is a bit more complicated sentence right
we have to focus on cliffs that's our
subject which so whatever our answer is
it's gonna be talking about cliffs it's
gonna be talking about some distinctive
or unique feature of a cliff what is
unique about cliffs a they are the high
steep parts of land B they are the low
flat parts of land or sea have many
trees growing on them which one seems to
be the best if you chose a you would be
correct cliffs are the high high steep
right usually vertical parts of land
right there's a sudden drop or a sudden
rise in the land that is what a cliff is
not low flat parts of the land cliffs
are not flat they're steep or usually
vertical they have many trees growing on
them
well cliffs might have trees growing on
them but that's not a distinct feature
of cliffs it doesn't matter if there are
trees growing on them or not
in fact it's kind of hard for trees to
grow on a cliff because you know trees
have to grow up they don't grow straight
out but sometimes you do see some very
strong or very desperate trees growing
this way out of cliffs sometimes you
can't see that okay but it's not very
common okay number four a river usually
starts at a so where do rivers usually
start okay we talked about this when we
talked about streams because streams
also usually start at the same place
remember
dreams and rivers are basically the same
thing there there water that's flowing
from a high place to a low place but
where where's the high place that they
start at that's that's our clue a a
plane and finishes at a mountain so the
the river starts at a plane and finishes
at a mountain that would be strange
because the river would be flowing there
the wrong way so a is not correct B
starts at a lake and finishes at a hill
again that's kind of strange why would a
why would a river start at a lake and
then finish at a hill that's also going
up a river usually starts in a mountain
and finishes at a beach all that makes
sense because mountains are high parts
of land the beach is very low it's right
where the where the land meets the ocean
at the lowest point right so that makes
sense and it's true that a rivers and
streams usually start at a mountain
right and finish at a beach usually but
not always you know sometimes it's
sometimes rivers go underground right
they finish on the ground you might be
following a river and then it disappears
it goes underground sometimes that does
happen but usually they go all the way
out to the sea and they finish at the
beach by the ocean okay let's move on
now remember our chart that we talked
about before and we looked at some
videos of the different types of land
now let's let's review and let's put in
the different names of these features of
land and water I will tell you the
distinctive features of each piece of
land or the the type of water and then
together we'll figure out how do we
label them how do we classify them so
let's start of course with land over
here we have a high piece of land right
the sides are very steep what it's
usually the highest part of the land
what do we call it we call that a
mountain okay good so if you chose
mountain you're correct over here we
have a picture now this is also a high
piece of land but it's not as high as
not as high as a mountain what do we
call that we call that of course a hill
okay let's move on down here here we
have a large a large flat piece of land
there are not many trees growing on this
flat piece of land what do we call it we
call that of course a plane this is a
plane over here we have a an area of low
land it's low land and it is between
mountains ok looks like it's between
mountains there so we have an area of
low land between mountains usually
there's a stream or a river at the
bottom of it we call that of course a
valley ok valleys low land between
mountains or Hills let's move on to
water what do we have here we have two
pictures of moving water right this one
is smaller this one is larger so when we
have a small or narrow piece of moving
water we call that a stream right
because it's narrow it's not very big
and we can usually walk across it maybe
step across that or jump across it okay
over here similar thing but this water
is moving although it looks like it's
not moving it's it's but it is moving
and it's very wide okay so we cannot
cross it right we'd have to swim across
it or build a bridge across it or take a
boat and paddle across it that of course
is a river river is a large long piece
of moving water okay let's move on down
here here we have the wave coming in on
the sandy beach this is a very very
large body of water so large usually you
cannot see across it another feature of
this type of water is that it has a lot
of salt in it it is salt water so what
do we call it we of course call that an
ocean okay over here we have a smaller
body of water a small body of water a
smaller piece of water and it's usually
freshwater we could drink that water
okay so what do we call that we would
call that a lake okay so that wraps it
up for today's lesson I hope you've
learned a lot and as always it was kind
of an interesting lesson as I said I
have some kind of special connection
with this because my dad's a geologist
but it's very interesting to take a look
at the earth around you and look at the
different features and think about what
are the unique characteristics of each
of land well that's it for today we'll
see you guys next time take care
everybody</p></div>
