hello everyone welcome back to American
textbook reading I'm Brian Stewart well
we're on the last unit of the book unit
15 we're continuing the theme of land
and water we're going to be looking at
places on earth as you can see in these
pictures there are many different places
on the earth so in this unit you will
discover different types different types
of land and water as you can see in
these pictures we have many different
types of land and water let's get
started with the first one the first one
is mountain mountain very tall mountains
as you can see in this picture a
mountain is the highest type of land the
highest type of land the most high of
course don't say most high it's the
highest
it's the highest place that you can go
on earth is in a mountain where is the
highest place you can go on earth do you
know the highest mountain its Mount
Everest right Mount Everest is the
highest place of very tall mountain
Mount Everest is the highest place on
land that would be a mountain what about
a plane if you talk about a mountain
it's like the opposite of a mountain is
a plane because mountains are very tall
and mountains are very steep but a plane
is very flat a plane is a large flat
piece of land you can see forever right
you don't see any trees you don't see
any mountains you don't see any hills
just very flat land I will the very
large plane and usually animals live on
the plains large groups of animals will
live together and run across the plains
and they eat the plants that grow on the
plane ok we also have a desert and a
desert is a very different type of place
it's
a very beautiful place as you can see
but it's also a difficult place to live
why is it so difficult because a desert
is a very dry area of land there's not
much water or very very little water in
a desert so plants and animals can't
live there it's very difficult for
living things to live in a desert you
see these people here they're just
passing through they have to get out of
the desert to find some plants and water
in order to survive right so they're
just passing through okay we also have a
river now our River is much different
than a desert right a river has got lots
of water in it right and usually we find
rivers in mountains but also on planes
this river is going through a mountain
here and it's going pretty fast
a river is a large stream of moving
water moving water the river means that
the water is moving if it's not moving
we call it something different we'll get
to that in a second
but the river means that the water is
moving now there's another word here
that's interesting a stream so we have
streams and we have rivers streams are
usually smaller right if there's just a
little bit of water and you maybe you
can step across it we call that a stream
rivers are larger it's more difficult to
cross a river you can't jump over it you
can't step over it you have to walk
through it or be very very careful
sometimes you have to swim across a
river but be careful crossing a river
don't cross the river unless an adult is
with you or maybe there's a bridge or
the river isn't moving very fast but be
very careful around rivers because it's
moving water it could be dangerous
okay also we have valleys you will find
where do you find valleys do you find
valleys on plains
no you wouldn't find valleys and Plains
because valleys mean that you have to
sign
right planes are very flat so you would
find a valley where that's right in the
mountains right so on either side you
have mountains and between the mountains
you have a valley because a valley is
the lowland between mountains and hills
okay so when you have a mountain right
the land goes up on either side between
those you have a valley and some valleys
are very beautiful people put houses in
there
of course valleys are easy that you can
come up into the mountains you go
through the valley and that's how you
get up into the mountains and easier way
than climbing up the side of the
mountain which is very difficult okay
remember I said that a river is moving
water if the water is not moving then we
can call it a lake one thing we can call
it as a lake a lake is a large area of
fresh water right rivers and streams are
usually freshwater and if the river
stops moving in it and it grows an area
we call that a lake and of course we
find many lakes and mountains but you
can find lakes in all sorts of places
right also on the plains in hills but in
mountains also especially this is a very
beautiful lake in the mountain it's a
small lake some lakes are really really
big you can't see across them but if
it's freshwater we call it a lake not an
ocean right so freshwater is a lake okay
also we have a hill a hill is just a
higher part of a land right sometimes of
course you have Plains right and
sometimes the plains will stop and their
land will rise gently not very steeply
like a mountain but a very gentle rise
and the land won't go up very high we
called these areas hills and especially
if you have a lot of hills it's very
gentle you can call them rolling hills
rolling hills because it seems like whoa
rolling hills it seems like the land
is ruling right seems very gentle and
very nice
so hills are a higher area of land and
they're fun to run up and run down and
when the winter comes and there's snow
on the hill you can take a sled and
slide down the hill okay we also have an
interesting type of land called an
island in the ocean you can find islands
but you can also find islands in lakes
sometimes - if the lake is very big an
island is just a piece of land with
water all around it all around it like
these we have two islands here there's
water all around these pieces of land
right so we call these islands by the
way we don't pronounce the s in island
it's just island not is 'land island
island okay so an island is an a piece
of land with water all the way around it
some islands are very beautiful
especially in the Pacific Ocean very
beautiful nice beaches there are very
beautiful islands in the ocean okay well
we've talked about a lot of different
types of land okay and of course we're
talking about land and water so we have
two different groupings we can make for
places on the earth we when we're
talking about different types of land or
different types of water now what we've
looked at in land we've looked at four
basic types of land we've looked at a
mountain right mountains are very tall
they are very steep desert a desert is a
place where there is very little or no
water it's a very dry area we've looked
at a valley remember a valley is it is
the area between two mountains or Hills
it's the low area between two mountains
and hills and usually there's a river at
the bottom of the valley or a stream
then we have planes planes are very flat
pieces of land right a lot of animals
will run around on the plains so these
are our four main types
land our four main types of land but
we're also talking about water we looked
at different types of water and we saw
stream and river well we kind of talked
about those together right I said a
stream is a small area of moving water
you can step across it or you can jump
across it that's a stream rivers are
wider you have to you know walk across
them you have to get your feet wet or
sometimes you have to swim across them
but be very careful with rivers because
they can be dangerous this river
this looks like it's they say it's a
river so the water must be moving
remember the water must be moving to for
it to be a river but this looks like a
very calm river the river is not moving
very fast also we saw lake a lake of
course is freshwater and we didn't
really talk about ocean but we talked
about ocean before in the book ocean is
salt water and of course we talked about
the big five main oceans of the world
right oceans are very very big and they
have salt water so an important thing to
remember a lake has fresh water and an
ocean has salt water okay so salt water
in the ocean fresh water in the lake and
of course streams and rivers are also
fresh water so we have our two main
groupings here we have four different
types of land and we have four different
types of water that we're looking at in
this lesson okay let's move on to our
word matching exercise we're going to
take the words and match them to the
definitions what are our words our words
are Mountain mountain plain plain desert
desert not desert right desert is SS and
that's what you eat after dinner but
we're talking about desert desert okay
River River Valley Valley and Lake Lake
so we can't talk about all of them we
only have six
not eight but let's talk about these six
words here and match them to their
definitions number one a very dry area
of land the key word here is dry it's
very dry oh no water or very very little
water remember what we talked about is
very difficult for plants and animals to
live there what is it of course it's a
desert a desert ok number two the
highest type of land so very high
remember the highest place on earth we
call it Everest we call it Mount Everest
mount of course is for mountain so the
highest type of land is a mountain ok
very steep - oh yeah number three a
large flat piece of land right you can
look out you can see very far right and
usually there's not many trees on it you
can see very far many animals run around
on this area of land it's very flat we
call that area a plane right our key
word here is flat it's very flat piece
of land ok number four a large area of
fresh water a large area of fresh water
the water is probably not moving right
so what do we call that remember it's
fresh water not saltwater so we call
that area a lake okay a large stream of
moving water two words here large and
moving water so it's large it's not a
stream a stream is small so it's a large
air stream of moving water the water is
moving and it's not staying still like a
lake it's moving what do we call that
of course we call that a river a river
oh you're number six the lowland between
mountains and hills so we have two
mountains we have lowland between the
two mountains right usually a river runs
through it what do we call that area we
call that a valley so
Valley is the low land between two
mountains or two Hills okay so those are
our words let's take a look at two kinds
of water on earth and I kind of talked
about those already a little bit but we
can see salt water we can see freshwater
right we talked about salt water is in
oceans and freshwater is for lakes and
streams and rivers let's take a look
salt water and ocean is made up of salt
water so if you look at this beautiful
water very beautiful picture by the way
very nice beach I want to be there don't
you okay but anyway if you go into the
water don't drink the water pot right
it's salt water
that's horrible it tastes terrible you
cannot drink the water in an ocean
because there's too much salt in it
however you can drink the water in a
lake a river or a stream fresh water
fresh water is water without salt
there's no salt in the water rivers and
lakes and streams are fresh water so you
can drink this but be careful you know
nowadays there's a lot of pollution so
don't just go out and drink the water
ask your mom or dad if it's safe to
drink that water but usually we can
drink fresh water in lakes rivers and
streams okay we have several pictures
here we're going to look at the pictures
and then we're going to complete the
sentence to best describe the pictures
how can we best describe these pictures
what's our sentence our sentence is the
earth has different kinds of beep and
water so remember what are we talking
about in this unit we're talking about
two main groups of things right here we
have an ocean right so that's a type of
water here we have a river and mountains
a valley this is a very beautiful place
by the way it kind of looks like
Yellowstone where there's a waterfall
I'm not sure if it is or not but it's a
very beautiful place with
Mountains and a waterfall is here by the
way a waterfall is an interesting type
of water and land right we have a
waterfall so we have mountains stream
valley in between a river and a
waterfall here and over here we have
rolling hills very beautiful rolling
hills so we've talking about water water
and then over here what's the opposite
of water the earth has different kinds
of land and water okay so very easy
we're talking about different types of
land and water and basically we can
divide every place on the earth into
these two groups it's either land or its
water and there are many types of land
and there are many types of water okay
let's move on to our true/false
questions a lake is smaller than an
ocean so a lake is smaller than an ocean
is that true yes that is true absolutely
we talked about that I said there are
some lakes that you can't see across as
if it's freshwater sure it's a lake but
usually oceans are huge oceans are very
big especially as we saw in the previous
unit unit 14 we saw that oceans are very
very big lakes are usually smaller are
always smaller than oceans number two
lakes and rivers are salt water so lakes
and rivers are salt water you can't
drink the water from lakes and rivers
that doesn't sound right that's false
we need to change salt to fresh if we
did that then the sentence would be
correct lakes and rivers are fresh water
that's correct not salt water so that's
false
oh yeah number three a hill remember we
talked about the hills right a hill is a
piece of land with water all around it
right a hill is a piece of land with
water all around it does that sound
right doesn't sound right right it's
false okay so that's false
ah Hill is just a higher area of land
right there could be other land all the
way around it but what type of land did
we look at that we saw that is special
because it has water all around it do
you remember of course we call that area
we call that place an island and
remember it's pronounced island and I
because it's a vowel we have to say an
an island an island is a piece of land
with water all around it that would be
true but we have to change the sentence
so this sentence is false
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
part let's take a short break here we'll
come back and take a look at the reading
section in just a short bit okay
everybody welcome back to the reading
section we've got a lot of sentences
here of course in our reading section
and usually the first sentence is our
topic sentence and that's exactly what
we've got here we have our topic
sentence there are many different types
of land and water that's a great topic
sentence isn't it
it describes exactly what we're talking
about
in this unit we're talking about two
types of land and water so we have land
and water here there are many different
types types of land and water so that's
what we're talking about here now in the
sentence they talked about land first so
that's what we're going to read about
first usually that's good organization
right don't switch them around don't say
there are many different types of land
and water and then talk about water
first that's not good organization right
good organization if you mentioned land
first then talk about land and that's
exactly what we've got our first
sentence after that is a mountain is so
a mountain is the highest kind of land
very simple definition sentence so we
talked about a mountain first next we'll
talk about a hill
and same pattern the same pattern of
sentence a hill is also high but it is
smaller than a mountain
yeah Hill is also high but it is smaller
than a mountain okay so we have two
definition sentences right after our
topic sentence talking about types of
land the third sentence is also talking
about land talking about valleys there
are low valleys we use there are to talk
about plural there are valleys there are
low valleys between mountains and hills
so we talk about water valleys
then we talk about water okay first we
talked about land now we're gonna talk
about water and the first type of water
we're going to talk about is rivers
rivers flow toward the ocean now flow
means move
remember rivers are moving water when
water moves we say that it flows
okay so rivers flow toward the ocean of
course all rivers go to the ocean right
that's where all the fresh water goes
into the ocean it becomes salty okay
they sometimes go through flat plains
okay now we're kind of mixing it up
right we're talking about water but
we're also talking a little bit about
land so next we can grow many kinds of
food on planes whether they are high or
low so that's interesting
we have planes can be high or planes can
be low we have an interesting idea here
we can grow many kinds of food okay so
of course if planes are flat we can use
them to grow food like I said before a
lot of animals will run around on the
plains because there are plants growing
on this plains and especially if a river
is going through the flat plate you've
got water right there so you've got land
you've got water it's a good place to
grow all plants and grow crops on planes
okay and of course planes can be high up
in a high area you know if there's
mountainous suddenly there's a flat
piece of land those are planes in the
mountains are surrounded by mountains
also planes can be lower down in near
the ocean
for example or in lower areas of land so
planes can be high planes can be low we
cannot grow food in a dry desert we
cannot grow food why because it's dry if
you don't have water you can't grow
plants so of course we can't grow food
in a dry desert ok a lake
another area of water ok so we the
before we saw River we kind of mixed it
in with with different types of land but
now we're talking about a water again a
lake another area of water
another area of water why do they say
another area of water because we just
talked about a river right a river flows
down to the ocean now we're talking
about a lake which is another area of
water besides a river has land all
around it so it doesn't flow to the
ocean like a river right
it has land all around it which is
interesting because we talked about an
island has water all around it but a
lake is water with land all around it so
lakes and islands are like complete
opposites aren't they so a lake is
another area of water it has land all
around it so lakes don't flow to the
ocean like a river however of course
sometimes rivers come out of lakes right
and they flow to the ocean but lakes
don't flow lakes are water surrounded by
land that do not move right they don't
the water doesn't move in a lake
ok an island I just talked about that we
talked about it is the opposite of a
lake it's the exact opposite right it is
an area of land with water all around
right water all around for an island a
lake has land all around so like we said
is very interesting they are complete
opposites ok now we have our reading
skill chart here it's a very big chart
as you can see the reading skill topic
is classified so this is a very good
unit for this type of organizational
structure
because we're talking about two
different types of places on earth we
have land and we have water two
different groups we can classify what
types of land there are and what types
of water there are and that's what we're
doing in this chart over here we have
land and we have many details about
different types of land down on the
bottom we have water and we have details
about different types of water so let's
look at this chart fill in the blanks
with these words on the bottom our words
are land flat between highest hill and
rivers so what how can we put these
words into the details about these types
of places on earth first of all we're
talking about land and the first type of
land we talk about is a mountain a
mountain is the BEP kind of land so
remember we were talking about mountains
before and we're talking about mountains
they are very what right you look wow
there's a mountain very high up there so
we have to say highest is the highest
kind of land right okay down on B we
have a or an beep is smaller than a
mountain so we're looking for an area of
land that's high but smaller than a
mountain not as high because a mountain
is the highest kind of land so what word
are we looking for a large flat between
highest hill rivers hill over here if
you chose Hill you would be correct a
hill is smaller than a mountain they're
both high places of land but a hill is
smaller a mountain is the highest okay
we're also talking about valleys valleys
are lowlands where do we find valleys we
find them beep mountains and Hills what
do we put in that beep land flat between
height well highest we're talking about
Hill rivers of course we find valleys
between between mountains and Hills so
that's our answer
valleys are lowlands between mountains
or Hills
okay Plains is our next type of land
what can we say about Plains what's the
important feature about Plains that we
talked about our Plains Highland are
they like this no Plains remember like
this they are what they are flat so
Plains are flat and we grow food on them
Plains are good to grow food on the next
detail about land we're talking about
deserts there's no blank to fill in but
just remember the key word about deserts
is that they are dry deserts are very
dry and that's the key word of the
important feature about deserts ok let's
move on to water the first type of water
we look at is a lake now a lake is an
area of water that has what all around
it it has what all around it remember
lakes are the opposite of islands
islands have water all around it but a
lake has land all around it right a lake
is an area of water that has land around
it okay the next one F we don't know
what type of water we're talking about
because it's missing so we have to think
about the definition go toward the ocean
what goes towards the ocean that would
be this one right here right rivers
rivers go toward the ocean so rivers
flow rivers move right that's the
important point about rivers they're
freshwater but they are moving water and
they are moving towards the ocean
they're going down hill okay so that's
our our reading skill chart for land and
water let's take a look at the reading
comprehension questions the first one is
what is a place where we can grow food
so we're looking for a place where we
can do something what is it we can grow
food now remember we're talking about a
place that needs to be flat right and it
should have water nearby let's take a
look a is a desert can we grow food in a
desert no we talked about that in the
desert is very there's no or very little
water we said it's very difficult for
plants and animals to live in a desert
because there's no water so deserts are
not a good place to grow food what about
a plane a plane is very flat sometimes
they have rivers running through planes
lots of animals running around planes
lots of plants growing on planes so sure
a plane is a good area that we can grow
food on can we grow food on rivers think
about that
remember rivers are moving water if we
put the seeds in the water pot they're
gone right they go down towards the
ocean so of course we can't grow food on
rivers there's many reasons one of the
big reasons is if we try to belt they'll
go away
right because rivers are moving water so
that's kind of a funny silly answer
right oh yes - on earth there are
valleys between what by the way this is
kind of a silly part of the sentence on
earth but it doesn't just have to be on
earth there are also these things on
Mars right on different planets anytime
you have mountains and hills right there
are valleys between them so that's what
we're looking for on earth earth we can
just ignore this by the way we can just
start here there are valleys between
what deserts and Hills between deserts
and Hills there are valleys
no because deserts sometimes go like
this and then you have a hill there's
nothing between them so that's not right
between rivers and beaches that doesn't
sound right either because when a river
comes down to the ocean the river runs
right through the beach right and it
goes into the ocean
there's no valley there how about hills
and mountains that's what we're talking
about right the answer of course is
hills and mountains there are valleys
between hills and mountains so sometimes
you see these senses and sometimes you
kind of think well it's not just on
earth so sometimes you can just ignore
parts of the sentence and in this case
that's true because on other planets
there are also valleys
between mountains and hills that's
something interesting and very
fascinating to think about but anyway
the important part is valleys are
between hills and mountains okay number
three and island remember island is not
the same as a lake because why remember
we talked about this we said islands and
lakes are complete opposites there
they're very interesting if you think
about it
completely opposite because an island is
not the same as a lake because why a an
island is like a river it flows an
island is land does land flow like a
river no land doesn't flow like a river
it it it doesn't move we can't see it
moving it does move but it takes a very
very very long time to move we can't see
it move so um that's not true an island
is like a river islands don't flow Abbey
an island has land all around it because
an island has land all around it think
about that don't get confused an island
if an island has land all around it it's
not an island right it's just a piece of
land it's not it doesn't make it an
island what's special about an island an
island has water all around it an island
has water all around it so B is not
correct but C is an island is not the
same as a lake because an island has
water all around it a lake has land all
around it so a lake has land all around
it but an island has water all around it
so C is the correct choice in that case
remember they're like complete opposites
exact opposites of each other
number four rivers sometimes go through
planes ABC and they flow up hills and
mountains
so do rivers go up hill think about that
does that make sense of course not
because gravity is making them go down
right so that's not true rivers don't
flow
hills and mountains they go down towards
the river towards the ocean sorry
the rivers go down towards the ocean
they do not flow up that would be
against the laws of gravity okay be and
they flow toward the oceans rivers
sometimes go through planes and they
flow toward the ocean does that sound
right yeah that's what we were talking
about rivers flow move towards the ocean
sea let's look at sea for practice and
we grow food and plants in rivers now if
we talked about that that's silly right
we can't grow food and plants in rivers
because of course the river is moving
right and of course plants and and food
don't grow in water they need land so
that's also silly there's many reasons
why we can't grow food or plants and
rivers the main reason is of course
because the water is moving ok let's
move on to our chart we've seen this
before in this unit we're talking about
different types of land and different
types of water let's take a look at the
pictures and fill in the labels for
those pictures here we see very high
pieces of land in fact these are the
highest pieces of land on earth right
what do we call the highest area of land
we call those of course mountains or one
mountain here we have a picture oh it's
very dry right seems very hot and if I'm
there I want to drink water but I can't
find any water there's no or very little
water in this area there's just a lot of
sand right so this area is called a
desert okay that's a desert let's move
down here what do we see we see a piece
of land and it's very flat isn't it
that's our key word or a key a point
about this type of land is that it's
very flat we call that a plain over here
we have an interesting piece of land
it's between mountains and it's a low
land low land between mountains what do
we call this area of course this area is
called
vally so these are our types of land how
about water what are our types of water
now we have here a very small area of
moving water we can see that the water
is moving but it's small we can step
across it or we could jump across it so
it's a small area of moving water we
call that a stream but if it's bigger if
it's wider we can't jump across it we
can't step across it what do we call it
then we call that a river so streams and
rivers streams are small rivers are big
or wide okay the next one down here this
is a very big area of water and the
water you can't drink it all right it's
has a lot of salt in it so it's called
an ocean ocean has salt water in it now
here we see an area of water and this is
surrounded by land there's land all
around it and it's fresh water what do
we call it we call that of course a lake
okay so in this unit we've been talking
about land and water and we've been
talking about the different types of
land and the different types of water we
can separate all areas all places on
earth into these two types are two main
groups
it's either land or its water and
there's some very beautiful and very
interesting pieces of land there's also
some very interesting and beautiful
places of water or areas of water okay
well I hope you've learned a lot in this
lesson we'll see you next time take care
