People use senses to learn about matter. There are five senses:
hearing,sight,smell,taste,and touch. Hearing is the ability to
hear with your ears. You use your hearing so you can recognize which
dog makes which sound. Sight is the ability to see with your eyes. You
can recognize whether something is big or small, or has dark or bright
colors. Smell is the sense of being aware of things with your nose.
Flowers smell sweet in spring. Taste is the sense of
being aware of flavor with your mouth. When you
taste, you can recognize if the food is sweet, salty,
sour, or bitter. Touch is the sense by which
we feel things with our skin. When you
touch a cat‚Äôs fur, it feels very soft. With
five senses, people can study the
shape, color, size, etc. of matter.</p>

hello everybody welcome back we're going
over American textbook reading and we're
changing the subject with this new
lesson physical science is what we're
talking about now with lesson 12 matter
and senses so in this unit you will
discover people use senses to learn
about matter so let's talk about senses
first we're going to talk about five
different senses and you can see ideas
about senses going on here we only have
four pictures but in every one of these
picture they're also using a fifth sense
okay
taste hearing smell sight and they're
all touching something so those are our
five senses matter what is matter we'll
talk about that a little bit more that's
one of our words but matter is
everything that surrounds you all the
objects that you can touch smell see
here those are all matter so let's begin
let's talk about the senses first our
first sense that we'll talk about is
hearing we saw this picture of the boy
right he's listening he's listening he's
trying to hear something so hearing is a
sense listening is a verb to listen
hearing is a sense hearing is the
ability to hear so if you can hear
something if you can detect sound you
can hear it okay and we use hearing to
figure out or to learn about things
around us to learn about our environment
that's one sense the second one sight
human beings we rely on our site
probably the most out of any other sense
sight is very important to humans
because we need it to see different
colors different faces to know who is
who we need to see it
we need our sight to see for example if
we're going to school we need to see the
bus number we need to see taxis we need
to see subways we use our sight all the
time especially playing video games or
using computers
we're relying on sight so sight is
probably the most common sense that we
use sight of course is the ability to
see something when you see something
when you look at it when you watch
something you are using your sense of
sight ok let's go into the third sense
the third sense is smell all right can
you smell that perfume in the air in the
springtime you can smell flowers right
smell is the sense of being aware of
things through one's nose that's
interesting of being aware of things
through one's nose you sometimes if your
brother he takes off his shoes and you
become aware of your brother's feet how
through your nose
ohoho and them say not by alright your
feet smell right so you know smells can
be good that smells can also be bad so
smelling is the sense of being able to
be aware of something through your nose
so you can have good scent good smells
like for example this girl is smelling a
flower ah that's a good smell but old
dirty feet that's a bad smell ok so good
smells and bad smells let's move on
taste of course we have good tastes and
bad tastes as well taste is the sense of
being aware of a flavor of something wow
she's a she's a very talented chef looks
like she's a so very talented cook she's
tasting what she is cooking to see if
it's good or not hopefully it's a good
taste and not a bad taste right so taste
is using your tongue really in your
mouth to be aware of flavor and of
course our tongue is the organ that we
use to sense our to taste something so
we can figure out if something is sweet
if it's sour if it's bitter or what does
exactly it taste like so we use the
tongue for that that's their sense of
taste let's move on our final fifth test
the fifth sense that we're talking about
here number five is touch now we use
touch a lot we don't really think about
it that much you know we we think about
you know eyes are for sight noses for
smelling eye
ears are for hearing mouth and and
really tongue is for tasting but our
whole body is used for touching we can
touch things with our face to see if
it's soft right grab something against
your face you can use your hands to
touch something because your hands are
usually used for that they're safer you
know if you're touching something you
want to touch it with your hands before
you touch it with your face because your
hands are tougher than your face but you
can use your arms you can use your legs
you can use your toes these are all ways
that we can use the sense of touch touch
is the sense by which we feel things you
can feel something with the skin on your
face right your dog's fur right you rub
up against your dog with your face you
feel how soft the fur is you feel
something with your hands to figure out
what is it especially if they're the
lights are out there's no if there's no
light or you can't see then you use your
hands to feel something if you want to
know if the water is hot or cold you can
touch it with your toes right then you
can figure out if it's hot or cold so we
use our whole body our skin to use the
sense of touch okay now let's talk about
another word here matter were you we're
talking about the five senses why
because we want to know about matter
we're looking around us we want to know
about our environment we want to know
about the things that are around us and
this is called matter matter is all
things are made of this matter has
weights right and it takes up space so
two main features a matter one it takes
up space that means it exists it takes
up some three-dimensional space in our
world it takes up some certain volume
and it weighs something it is heavy even
if it's a feather and it has a it's very
light it still weighs something right it
still has some weight a little bit of
weight and a feather which is very small
it doesn't take up a lot of space but it
still takes up some space everything in
our world that has weight and takes up
space is matter and
everything really okay so when we talk
about matter we're talking about we can
use adjectives to describe what the
matter is like right and one of the
adjectives we can use is shape remember
I just said that matter takes up space
it has certain shape when it takes up
that space when it takes up space it has
a type of shape shape is the outer form
of something so whatever it is that
matter that exists there it's making
some sort of shape and there's lots of
different shapes as we can see we can
call these by different names this shape
here is a cone on the top this is a cone
shape this block of wood here if you see
that that is a block so if we say it is
a block we're talking about the shape
what about this shape here that's an
interesting shape this shape is a called
a cylinder a cylinder this shape is a
cylinder so there's lots of different
shapes it's the outer form of something
and that's one thing that we can talk
about matter and that's the shape of
something we can also talk about the
color of something when we describe
matter we don't just have to talk about
the shape we can also talk about what
color is it the quality of being red
blue over here or yellow or etc lots of
different colors green turquoise or pale
blue and this is this is also blue but
this is purple okay so yeah you have
different shades of blue here yellow
green red and purple so these are all
different colors right and when we talk
about matter we can talk about them when
we describe them we can talk about their
color so we can talk about shape we can
talk about color we can talk about size
okay so we can also talk about size how
big is something how large or small
something is if it's small medium sized
or large right so large medium small how
big is it right how what how large is it
how small is it either way we can we
can ask about the size okay we have a
nice chart here talking about the five
different senses we have the five senses
here we can just go over them and you
can see like I talked about before we
talk about the different body parts that
are associated with the different senses
first of all we have sight we have an
eye of course we use our eyes to see
things to look at it and we use our eyes
to figure out what color is it we could
use our eyes to see what size it is or
the shape of something especially over
here we have hearing and of course we
use our ears to hear that's the organ
that we use to for the sense of hearing
we use our ears to hear what does
something sound like what kind of sound
does it make over here we have smell
smell of course is associated with the
nose right we smell something whether
it's beautiful flowers on a spring day
or your brother's wet old socks right on
every day I'm just kidding but uh you
know we use our sense of smell we can
detect we can become aware of things
through our sense of smell over here
taste and remember taste the organ
that's associated with taste is our
tongue inside of our mouth we can taste
things
looks like she's tasting some could be I
think it's ice cream is what she's
tasting and she's getting ice cream all
over her lips right of course ice cream
is very good it tastes great
remember this good tastes and bad tastes
there are good smells there are bad
smells ice cream is a good taste right
lemon lemon is a sour taste right so
lots of different types of tastes
finally we also have our fifth sense
don't forget about touch right sometimes
we don't think about that we might
forget about that sense now of course
normally we use our fingers for the
sense of touch but remember you can use
your whole body for touch you can touch
something else with any part of your
body and the touch so this person has a
a small pet looks like a a hamster in
her hands and you know she's touching it
the Hampshire is very soft it's furry
it's warm we can sense these things
through our sense of touch okay let's
watch a video associated with these
senses here whoo he's kind of scary
okay hello okay let's see what he's
gonna do okay let's see what it what
what's gonna happen here he's okay he's
pointing to his eyes he's full first his
ears in his eyes and his nose then his
mouth he's talking he's showing us all
the different five senses so what he did
basically years for hearing eyes for
seeing nose for smelling mouth for
tasting and hands for touching okay so
we saw the different ways to sense
matter that is around us thank you very
much sir okay we will move on now okay
now we're going to go over the exercise
we're gonna talk about the different
words we're gonna match these words to
their definitions okay the first one the
sense of being aware of things through
one's nose so when you use your nose to
become aware of something around you
what sense is that okay if you chose
smell that would be correct that would
be the sense of smell okay number two
the sense of being aware of flavor right
when you use your tongue yeah you lick
some ice cream right or you lick a lemon
you're becoming aware of the flavor the
flavor of something how does it taste
right how does it taste
oops how does it taste how does it taste
what is its flavor what is its flavor
okay so we use these words in different
ways what is its flavor how does it
taste if you want to know the answer to
the question what sense do you use you
should of course use your sense of taste
use your tongue what does it taste like
how does it taste okay number three the
ability to hear when you know when
there's a sound out there in the world
some form of matter has created a sound
lots of different sounds what sense are
you using to detect to become aware of
that sound you are using your sense of
hearing the ability to hear
okay so we're moving on to number four
something that has weight and takes
space okay so you see we're taking a
short break from the senses right now
but we use our senses to figure out
things about this something that has
weight remember two important things it
has weight and it takes up space it
takes space what is that of course that
is matter all the things around you
every object that you can see that you
can hear that you can touch that you can
taste that you can smell all of these
things are matter okay number five the
sense by which we feel things so if you
feel something is it hot is it cold is
it soft is it rough is it smooth the
sense that we're talking about here is
of course touch we can you we normally
use our fingers and our hands to feel
things but remember you could use your
whole body to feel something okay
usually we use our fingers or maybe our
toes if it's a hot or cold water to see
if it's if it's hot or cold but that's
the sense of touch number six the
ability to see now this of course is our
most important sense it's the most
commonly used sense for people and of
course we talked about that that is of
course the sense of sight now it's
interesting I say I've said that a
couple times the ability to see is the
most important sense for people but for
some animals you know they don't rely on
their sense of sight and that much like
for example dogs dogs they very they
very commonly rely on their sense of
smell to be able to smell different
scents so they can figure out whether a
person is Joe or a person is Robert you
know Robert and Joe don't smell the same
dogs can find out that very quickly we
don't usually do that we don't go around
smelling people we look we use our sense
of sight look at their faces and then we
can see oh that's Joe and that's Robert
so it's interesting to also notice that
you know different animals use different
sense
is to find out about matter in the world
okay well let's move on here we have a
nice chart comparing things okay so when
we compare things when we look at
different types of matter we can use our
senses to find out how things are the
same or how they are different okay
let's take a look
sense okay we have the sense over here
which is a sight or touch this is the
object teddy bear we can see we can use
a sight to find out some adjectives how
to describe it we can use touch to
describe it and for a plastic doll over
here we can use our sight to come up
with these adjectives and we can use our
sense of touch to come up with this
adjective so let's compare first of all
we have cents sight and touch first
object is a teddy bear when we look at a
teddy bear what can we find out about it
when we use our sense of sight we can
find out that the teddy bear is large
big and it's brown so we can find out
about its size and its color right size
in color then when we talk use our sense
of touch we can see what does it feel
like right what is the texture it is
rough right it's not smooth it's you
know kind of rough because it's got a
lot of fur or a lot of material sticking
out of it it's rough if we look at a
plastic doll and we compare it with a
teddy bear well first of all first of
all using our site we can see that it's
small it's smaller than the teddy bear
so the size is different it's blue the
color is different the teddy bear is
brown the plastic doll is blue here sure
it's brown there that's true it's
similar there you could say you could
use your sense of sight to say brown and
brown but it's also blue and yellow down
here so it's a little bit different we
use our sense of sight to find out these
differences for touch if we touch the
teddy bear it feels rough but if we
touch the smooth plastic teddy bear doll
we see that that's smooth okay
so plastic is smooth has a smooth
surface so basically this is a good
chart to give us an idea or a couple of
examples of how we use our senses to
find out about
things around us to learn about things
and we can compare things how were they
different right we can see these
different features of the things that
are around us using our senses okay
let's take a look at some pictures here
we're gonna take a little bit of a test
we're gonna say we'll look at the
picture and we're going to figure out
the correct body part we use to sense
the thing in each picture okay so over
here we have a picture looks like some
kind of lunch food it's we call this a
wrap right looks like a chicken wrap and
it's got some vegetables in there too so
if you're going to eat lunch right and
you want to find out about this food
what body part are you going to use to
find out about this food of course you
want to know what it tastes like what
does it taste like so are you gonna use
your ears right you're gonna take the
food and mash it up in your ears right
no don't do that or are you going to use
your mouth you can take the food and put
it in your mouth and chew it mmm it's
good of course you're gonna use your
mouth
don't use your ears that's crazy right
okay so you're not gonna listen to it
making it yourself no it doesn't make
any sound but you're gonna put it in
your mouth you're gonna taste it because
it has flavor you're gonna find out what
the flavor is now over here we have a
picture what are we talking about are we
talking about the fire here are we
talking about this truck here we're
talking about the truck now as you know
this is called a fire truck and when it
is going to a fire it has to get there
fast right it goes there very quickly so
it uses a siren at the top because we
write very loud noise so what part of
our body are we going to use when we
hear a fire truck coming we are going to
use our ears right first we're gonna
hear it a long time before we see it and
we're not gonna touch it because that
could be dangerous fire trucks are going
very fast no go ahead
it's gonna run you over okay so and if
you chase after it you're not gonna
you're not gonna catch it okay anyway
I'm being silly but anyway of course
we're gonna use our ears because we're
gonna hear that siren a long time before
we see it okay cuz it's a very loud
noise finally over here what is this you
have some interesting shapes you may not
be familiar with this this is of course
perfume if you go into your mother's
room but be careful don't don't go into
your mother's room unless your mother
says you can go into her room but on her
desk you can find stuff like this and
these are different types of perfume
what do we use perfume for what does
your mother use perfume for it well
she'll take a little bit of perfume
should put it on her finger and she'll
put it on her neck on both sides maybe
on her wrists why because she wants to
smell good right this is a kind of scent
right if you put perfume on your body
then you smell good and how do we learn
about perfume how do we learn about what
does it smell like do we use our mouth
no don't put for steam on your tongue
that's horrible
you would use your nose you would put a
little bit maybe on your finger and you
would smell it or you don't have to put
it on your finger you just open the
bottle and you can smell the perfume but
don't do that unless your mom says it's
okay because she might get upset if you
just go into her room and start smelling
her perfume okay okay so good let's move
on to our true or false questions again
if the sentence is true Circle T if it's
false circle F number one all things in
the world are made of matter we've
talked about this a lot so far so you
should probably get this right away of
course that is true everything all the
things that we can see everything we can
hear everything we can touch smell or
taste these things are all made of
matter it has weight it has some type it
takes up space in the world it is matter
so everything fits that description all
things in the world everything you can
look at everything around you is matter
ok that's true number two sight is the
ability to hear sounds strange doesn't
it it is strange it's false right sight
is not the ability here sight is the
ability to what see so that's wrong
that's false
okay number three
smell it's a sense that's true you smell
with your hands that's not true right
you don't smell with your hands oh
there's some perfume right no you use
your nose to smell something so you
smell with your nose
not your hands okay
so you smell with your nose so that is
false if we change up you smell with
your nose yeah not your hands so that is
false okay and it's two sentences so be
careful smell is a sense that's true but
you smell with your hands that's false
so remember you have to count both
sentences not just one sentence okay
that wraps it up for the vocabulary
learning stage we're gonna take a short
break now and we're going to take a look
at the reading after the break we'll see
you soon okay welcome back we're going
to go over the reading part for lesson
12 matter and senses we start off with
the topic sentence the topic sentence is
people use senses to learn about matter
so this reading passage will be about
how we use our senses to find out things
about matter remember there are five
senses and they list them here there are
five sentient senses sorry there are
five senses and of course we use a colon
here you use a colon when you're going
to list things number one number two
number three number four at the end of a
complete sentence there are five senses
that's a complete sentence then you're
going to list them so use a colon okay
what are the five senses hearing sight
down here smell over here taste right
there and touch right there so these are
the five senses we have them written
here we can also see the corresponding
pictures down here so those are the five
senses then we talk about each in turn
we talk about each one in turn we give
more details we say a little bit more
about each of the senses hearing is the
ability to hear of course with your ears
we use our ears to hear you use your
hearing so you can recognize which dog
makes which sound
ruff ruff is that my dog or is that my
neighbor's dog right which dog is it so
you use your hearing to recognize which
dog makes which sound or which person
makes which sound or which car makes
which sound so we use our hearing to
figure out about things around us sight
of course is the ability to see with
your eyes hearing is for ears sight is
four eyes notice the same construction
the same pattern used in all of these
sentences that's good writing you can
recognize whether something is big or
small or has dark or bright colors we
use our sight to be able to figure those
things out next we have smell smell is a
sense of being aware of things with your
nose each sentence says what it is and
it also says what body part is
associated with that sense it's it's the
same construction in each sense in each
sentence and like I said that's
important if you're going to write this
type of passage keep the same structure
keep the same organization this is a
good example flowers smell sweet in
spring yeah so you use your sense of
smell your brothers socks smell bad
every day okay so for example okay so
smell is a sense of being aware of
things with your nose taste is the sense
of being aware of flavor with your mouth
okay we use our mouth to detect taste
when you taste you can recognize if the
food is sweet salty sour or bitter
bitter right so that's when we use our
taste we can recognize those things
about matter food that is around us
finally our fifth sense is touch touch
is the sense by which we feel things
with our skin on our fingers on their on
our cheek with our toes any part of our
skin when you touch a cat's fur for
example it feels very soft be careful if
the cat bites you it feels very painful
right so we can use our
in any part of our skin to use our sense
of touch with the five senses so we've
covered the five senses what are things
that we can figure out about materials
then we have some information about that
with the five senses people can study we
can learn about shape color size etc of
matter so we can find out what is the
shape is it a cone shape a block shape
or a cylinder what color is it is it red
yellow or blue what size is it is it big
is it small you know well most of these
are on the same size but you know we can
talk about lots of different things
these are the three main things they're
talking about here
in terms of describing matter but
there's all sorts of other things we can
say is it heavy is it light we can talk
about all those different types of
features of different types of matter
okay let's get into our reading skill
here it is to classify now we're going
to classify the five different senses
the main idea here is people use its
senses to learn about matter that's our
topic sentence but we want to give more
details we want to classify the five
senses let's classify them let's
separate them into groups and give some
details about each here are our five
senses here and here are the information
or the ideas about each one let's start
over here with a now we need to fill in
the blanks with these words nose skin
ears sight actually a is kind of easy
because we know we have five senses
hearing smell taste touch which one is
missing
if you chose sight that's correct right
hearing with our ears smell with our
nose taste with our tongue touch with
our skin usually our fingers but all
over and sight finally with our eyes
okay so we filled in that one sight you
see things with your eyes that's what
we're talking about okay hearing you
hear things with your what I just said
that of you just a couple seconds ago we
hear things with our ears smell you
smell with your what nose our skin
you smell with your skin of course we
smell with our nose taste it's already
done for us
you taste food with your mouth and
finally touch you touch things with your
skin remember anywhere you touch things
with your skin so that's filled in there
ok let's move on to some comprehension
questions we have the sentence a
question and we have three possible
answers to that question number one
which sense can you use to know the size
of something how big is it
so what sense do you use now remember
you can use a couple of different senses
but we only have three choices here we
can use sight hearing or taste which one
seems to be proper to you if we look at
something of course we can see if it's
small or big so that's the answer right
if we hear if we try to hear something
we can't see if it's big or small right
especially imagine you're talking about
a box there's a box in your room the you
could have a small box you can have a
big box do you listen to them to find
out which is a small box and which is
the big box you can listen all day
you're never gonna figure it out taste
you're gonna lick the boxes to see which
one is big or small no that's crazy
right you're gonna use your sight by the
way you could also of course use the
sense of touch but that is not one of
the choices here you could feel them and
see all this is a big one and this is a
small one but touch is not here we only
have sight which is appropriate ok
number two how does a cat's fur feel we
talked about that if you pet a cat you
know you put your hand on it on the back
of a cat and you feel its fur the hair
on its body a bitter and black it's kind
of strange right bitter has to do with
taste right so we're talking about
feeling not taste black is a color
that's what it looks like that's not how
it feels so a is obviously incorrect be
very soft yeah we use our sense of touch
on a cat's fur to feel something and we
can see that it feel
very soft we can find that out by using
our sense of touch by seeing what does
it feel like see sweet
no sweet has to do with taste and
ruff-ruff is a type of feel but sweet
doesn't fit so if obviously that's wrong
it could be rough you know if you if you
want to know how a cat's tongue feels
like used you know put your finger on
your cat's tongue it's very very rough
okay but again you'd be using your sense
of touch how does it feel but we're
talking about fur here fur is very soft
okay let's move on number three with the
five senses you can study what what can
you study by using your five senses a
hearing sight smell and taste of matter
okay be size shape color and taste of
matter see size a matter with your taste
and smell now this is kind of an
interesting one right okay we have one
two three four one two three four here
okay uh what we've got here it came with
your five senses you can study the
hearing of matter sight of matter smell
a matter taste no matter does matter do
these things does matter here does
matter C does matter smell this is kind
of a tricky question right this is not
correct
because you cannot study the hearing of
matter what that means is that you can
study how matter hears that doesn't make
sense matter doesn't hear but what about
B you can study the size how big
something is shape what it looks like
color what color isn't and taste what
does it taste like of matter that is
true right because you can look at these
different features of matter using your
five senses okay so the difference here
is that you're looking at these features
of matter you're not studying how matter
here's how matter sees right because
remember all things that are matter if
you're talking about your computer your
computer doesn't hear right so that
doesn't make sense
right but you can see the size of your
computer you can see the shape of your
computer you can study the color and
the taste of your computer your computer
probably doesn't taste very good but you
can study these things using your five
senses see size of matter with your
taste and smell that just doesn't make
sense the size of matter with your taste
and smell that doesn't make sense okay
number four when you taste when you
taste something you recognize if the
food is what salty sweet sour or bitter
actually that's the correct answer we
just talked about that a little while
ago right so you can find out if the
food is salty of its sweet sour bitter
these are all tastes these are all
different types of tastes B red blue
green or yellow can you taste red can
you taste the blue no that's silly
that's crazy right you can't do that can
you taste if something is loud if it's
soft if it's near or if it's far no
that's also very silly so these are our
tastes salty sweet sour or bitter and we
can recognize when we use our sense of
taste we can recognize these things
about our food okay on our final slide
we have a chart here we looked at this
chart before let's test our memory these
of course we're talking about our five
senses we use our five senses to learn
about matter that is around us so let's
start up over here we have our eye we're
looking at something we can use it this
sense to figure out the color of
something the shape of something how big
something is what sense is that that's
our sense of sight the most important
sense for human beings our sense of
sight over here this boy he's listening
for something right he's using what
sense
he's using his sense of hearing he's
trying to pick up the sound of something
okay over here this girl she's out in
the field she has a flower she's using
her nose to find out about the flower
what sense is she using she's using her
sense of smell
okay she's using her sense of smell to
become more aware of the
flower in her hand this girl over here I
envy her she's eating ice cream right
okay so what is she using she's using
her tongue in her mouth
to find out more about that ice cream
and I'm sure she finds out that it's
sweet not salty not bitter not sour but
sweet and she's using her sense of taste
okay finally over here
this girl has a pet hamster in her hands
and she's petting the fur it's very soft
and it's warm and what sense is she
using she's using her fingers her skin
to figure this out so what sense is she
using she is using her sense of touch
okay this is a good roundup of the
different five senses that we use to
discover things about matter
remember matter is all around us it's
everything around us two important
things it has weight and it takes up
space and when we talk about matter we
can talk about size we can talk about
color we can talk about shape okay and
we use our five senses to find these
things out about matter well that wraps
it up for this lesson we'll see you guys
again next time take care everybody</p></div>
