<a href="https://youtu.be/KRfABAUcwK0‚Äã">Here on Earth</a></p>
<p>== Here on Earth ==
The planet where we live is called Earth. It is made up of air, water,and land. A very large area of land is called a continent. North America is a continent where most people speak English. 
On Earth, there is more water than land. An ocean is a large body of salt water. 
If the Earth is so big, how can we find new places? 
A compass rose, globe, and map are things we can use to discover places on the Earth. 
We can use a globe to plan our trip. Then we should use a compass rose and a map to find our direction. Take a look at a globe, try and plan a trip to a fun new continent. </p>

hello and welcome back to American
textbook reading I'm Brian Stewart we
are going over lesson 13 now we're
talking about here on earth where do we
live
we live here on earth in this unit you
will discover Earth's land and water as
you know earth is a planet right it has
water and land on the planet it also has
air we're going to be talking about the
earth in this lesson so are you ready
let's get started the first word of
course we're talking about is the earth
the earth this is where we all live no
none of you live anywhere else except
for on the earth right nobody none of
you live on the moon yet maybe someday
we'll live on the moon but not yet right
now we live on the earth and the earth
is the third planet from the Sun there's
actually a famous TV show in America
it's called the third the third Rock
from the Sun and this of course is a
very it's a it's a fun way of saying the
third planet from the Sun the third rock
because if you think about it the
planets are like big rocks right what
are the first three there's Mercury
Venus then earth okay then the fourth
one of course is Mars those are the
small planets next to the Sun Mercury
Venus Earth that's us and then Mars and
then there are other planets after that
the big ones but anyway this is the
earth and this is what the earth looks
like from space right so we can see it's
a very beautiful planet and it's where
we live it's it's our home it's the only
planet like this in our solar system and
it's the third planet from the Sun so
the Sun is here Mercury Venus Earth
that's us yay okay so one two three the
third planet from the Sun okay our next
word is globe globe is a round object
it's round it's like a ball right the
ball that you bounce don't bounce the
globe right it won't bounce but it's the
same shape as a basketball or baseball
things that are round the same shape
it's a round object that is a model of
Earth it's a model it's not the earth
had to be too big it's a model of the
earth we make it smaller it is like a
symbol of the earth and it is a model of
the earth so it looks like the earth the
way the earth actually looks like you
can see the different parts of the earth
on the globe it's like a map but it's a
map in 3d you know 3d of course 3d as
opposed to 2d 2d is a paper map a paper
map a paper map only has all two
dimensions right there's the dimension
wide and there's a dimension tall but 3d
has three dimensions you have this way
you have that way but you also have
inside you have three dimensions so a
globe is a model of the earth that is in
three dimensions and it looks like the
earth it's more accurate than a map a
map is only flat it's paper
that it has only two dimensions and
because it's only two dimensions some of
the earth are some of the earth that is
on the map is bigger than it should be
like on the edges of the map it's bigger
than on the center so a globe is a much
more accurate or better model of what
the earth looks like than a map land and
of course on the earth is where the hard
surface of the earth is as opposed to
water water is not the hard surface
right you can't
stand on water right you sink in the
water you'll go down in the water but on
land we can stand up the land is hard
we won't sink in the land of course we
live on land if it was just water we
wouldn't be able to survive or we would
be fish right we would be something else
but we wouldn't be human beings if we if
there was no land on the earth so land
is a hard surface of the earth land is
also where we grow our food that we need
this looks like a farm and they're
preparing to plant crops okay when we
talk about land we can also talk about
continent continent a continent is a
very big piece of land a very large area
of land a very large area of land or
very large piece of land this is a
continent this is the continent of North
America it is very very large it whoops
America North America so it includes
many countries you have Canada the
United States Mexico Cuba and other
countries in the Caribbean this is all
North America very large piece of land
by the way how many continents does the
earth have do you know the answer in
America we're taught that there are
seven continents we'll see a chart what
are they we'll see a chart later on in
this lesson what are the seven
continents on earth so I'll leave you in
suspense right think about that will
come to the chart soon what are the
seven major continents on earth think
about that we'll come there soon we'll
talk about that soon now that's
continent what about ocean right I
talked about land when I said land right
is the hard surface of the earth those
are where the continents and Islands are
that's where we stand but the other part
of the earth most of the earth is not
hard surface it's soft right it's the
ocean it's covered by water there are
oceans on the earth ocean is a large
area of salt water salt is the key salt
water that covers most of earth because
there are large freshwater areas those
are called lakes okay but if it's salt
water and it's very large it's called an
ocean how many oceans are there on earth
right I said there are seven continents
how many oceans do you know how many if
you chose five you would be correct
what are they think about that that's
part of the chart that we'll talk about
next are not next but soon okay so stay
stay tuned for that think about that
okay so continents and oceans now also
when we talk about the earth especially
when we look at a map it's very
important to notice the compass rose on
a map the compass rose it's not a flower
okay it just looks like a rose right it
kind of looks like a rose so people say
it's a compass rose now a compass rose
is a symbol it's a symbol it's not real
it's a symbol where do we find this
symbol we find the symbol on maps what
does it do it shows directions so it's a
symbol on maps that shows directions so
if you look at the map you can find the
compass rose printed on the map and it
shows which way is north which way is
east which way is south which way is
west that's what your compass rose will
show you it will show you directions so
if you're looking at a map you're
thinking well which way is north look
for the compass rose it will show you
so the compass rose is very important as
we can see in this video now this is not
a compass rose this is an actual compass
so what you do when you have a compass
and a map you have to change the
direction of the compass to match the
compass rose that we can't see on this
map but what this person is doing they
have to match so that North on the
compass is the north here is
the same direction as the compass rose
on the map so what they have to do is
they have to turn the compass so the
north and north on the compass rose on
the map are the same and then they can
figure out which direction on the map to
go for example they want to go from this
city over to this city they line it up
but this way is north they have to go
that direction they can see exactly what
direction they have to go in to get to
the next city and that's very important
obviously when you don't you know when
you look at the map you see the
direction then you put the map away and
you go in that direction you can use
your compass to walk or to drive to ride
a horse do whatever you want to get to
the other place but you need to know the
direction the compass rose will tell you
the direction on the map okay we have a
picture of the world here a chart of the
world now this is a map it's
two-dimensional before I said it
a map is not as accurate as a globe
because on a two-dimensional map things
at the top get really stretched out
right in the middle there okay they're
the same but as you go north or as you
go south things get really big Greenland
is not as big as it is on the map
Greenland is not for example that big
and the United States if you took
Greenland and put it over the United
States it wouldn't be half it would be
much smaller but because it's a map to
dimensions they it's not very accurate
things get spread out and they seem to
be bigger than they actually are at the
top and the bottom of the map but not on
a globe so a map is flat but a globe is
round just like Earth that's what I'm
talking about so we have a flat map and
we have a round globe they both they
both show Earth's land and water that's
true but a globe is better than a map
because it's more accurate it shows you
exactly the size and the location on the
globe however globes are not as
convenient as maps you can't pick up a
globe and
put it in your pocket and take it with
you right but you can't take a map and
fold it up and put it in your pocket and
take it with you so there are good and
bad things about maps and globes okay so
this is a good example right this is a
good example map do you see the compass
rose on this map that's right it's right
here
that's our compass rose and this of
course will point north south east west
so if I wanted to know if I put a
compass here and I want to know which
direction if I'm in China and I want to
know which direction is Egypt I'll put
my compass here line up the North on my
compass to the north on the compass rose
and then it will tell me what direction
what degree west by Southwest to get
over to Egypt there depending where I am
in China of course so it'll tell me what
direction I have to go in to get from
one country to another country or from
one city to another city one place to
another place okay so this is a good map
of the world now let's do a matching
exercise we're gonna match each word
with its definition so let's take a look
here the words are earth globe land
ocean continent continent and compass
rose compass rose two words
we'll think about it's together number
one a large area of salt water that
covers most of the earth right these
things cover most of the earth what do
we say it's not the hard surface of the
land it's the soft surface of the land
its water right the water surface of the
water is soft what do we call it and
it's salt water it's a large area of
salt water of course we say that is an
ocean it is the ocean oceans and land
cover the earth earth surface the earth
is the land is hard the oceans are soft
oceans are salt water to the third
planet from the Sun we talked about that
right Mercury Venus Earth are the
order of the planets from the Sun
Mercury is closest Venus is second
what's third I almost said it the earth
the earth is the third planet from the
Sun or the third Rock from the Sun as a
TV show title says number three a round
object a round object it's three
dimensions a round object that is a
model of Earth remember it's round not
flat it's round so what do we call that
we call that of course a globe a globe
is a model of the earth number four a
symbol so we're talking about here a
symbol where do we find it on maps what
does it do it shows directions and it's
on that so it's a symbol on maps that
shows directions or a symbol that shows
directions on maps what do we call that
remembers two words the only one to hear
this two words
compass rose and we saw an example of
that when we looked at a map of the
world we saw the example of the compass
rose number five the hard surface of the
earth right hard like your head right
it's very hard what do we call that that
part of the earth is land right not
ocean but land a very large area of land
so if you're talking about land very
large area of land what do we call that
remember there are seven of them on
earth there are seven very large areas
of land we separate them what are they
called
they're called continents continents ok
here is the chart I promised to show you
before when we talked about continents
and oceans remember I said there are
seven continents and five oceans what
are they well this chart tells us what
they are right Earth's land and water
very beautiful pictures by the way this
picture is of desert right of course
it's land this picture is a very hot
beautiful there it looks very nice looks
very blue and the Sun is over there
reflecting off the water this is of
course of the ocean
now there are seven continents American
schoolchildren are taught that there are
seven continents it's interesting
because in other countries sometimes
school children are taught there are
only five continents in some countries
there are six continents but American
school children learn that there are
seven continents and these are the
continents Africa Antarctica where is
Antarctica Antarctica is around the
South Pole
right it's covered with snow and ice but
there's land there right underneath all
that snow and ice there is land a large
area of land
it's called Antarctica in some countries
the school children are not taught that
Antarctica is a continent right so that
then they only have six continents but
American children consider Antarctica as
a continent Asia is a continent that's
where we are now
Australia Australia is a very it's a
it's an island but it's a very large
island right and it's a continent by
itself Europe is a continent North
America and South America are two
different continents sure they're
connected but there are two different
continents now it's interesting to in
some parts of the world people will not
consider Europe and Asia as different
continents because they're connected and
they're connected not by a narrow piece
of land but by a very large piece of
land
some people consider Europe and Asia as
one continent and they call that
continent Eurasia Eurasia so in some
countries they consider Eurasia as one
continent and if they also teach that
Antarctica is not a continent then in
those countries there's only five
continents but in America American
schoolchildren are taught that there are
seven continents and these are the
continents I'm not sure about Korea what
are you guys taught in school are you
taught that there are seven continents
six or five in this textbook of course
we're taught we're saying that there are
seven continents because this is
American text
greeting so in the states we say that
there are seven continents but it
depends on how you define the continents
it's very interesting there are five
oceans the Arctic Ocean Arctic where is
the Arctic Ocean that's at the North
Pole right it's between Russia Europe
and North America on the other side very
cold up there there's a lot of ice up
there and in fact a large part of that
ice never melts it's permanently there
so it's but it's not land it's just ice
there's no land so there's no continent
up there it's an ocean
it's the Arctic Ocean the Atlantic Ocean
where is the Atlantic Ocean it's between
Europe Africa and North America and
South America that is the Atlantic Ocean
then there's the Indian Ocean where is
the Indian Ocean well that's easy it's
around India right it's around India
it's between Australia and East Africa
right all that ocean there underneath
Asia is called the Indian Ocean then we
have finally the Pacific Ocean that's
the biggest ocean on earth it's huge
really really big that is the ocean
between Asia North America and also
Australia and South America right it's
really really big and there's a lot of
islands in the Pacific Ocean but it is
our it is the biggest ocean on earth it
is really really big and that is the
Pacific Ocean so there are five oceans
and in America we say that there are
seven continents ok let's complete the
sentences that best describe the
pictures these sentences describe these
pictures let's take a look at them so we
have a map is what but a globe is beep
just like Earth so what we're doing here
we can see that we're comparing a map
and a globe ok so that's what we're
doing we're comparing them how are they
different how are they the same in this
case we say
Mapp is what but a globe is this way
just like the earth so if we try to put
in there our words we don't have any
words so this is kind of difficult but
think about that if you take a map you
can spread it out right it's two
dimensions our globe is round it's three
dimensions I just gave it to you globe
is round if a globe is round a map is
what a map is flat right when we put the
map out it's flat on the table and like
I said before a globe is round just like
Earth now that's how they're different
how are they the same they both show
they both show earth what and what they
remember the two things we talked about
on earth right we talked about there 7
of 1 5 of the other they both show earth
land and water
so we could say continents and oceans
but we can also say land and water
either one would work in this case we're
using land and water because we can see
the Earth's land or continents we
concede the Earth's water or oceans ok
land and water
so this is basically the difference and
the similarity between maps and globes
both of them help us learn about the
earth where we live
let's do our true/false questions a
globe is a flat object that is a model
of Earth so a globe so a globe is a
model of Earth that's true but is it
flat no we just talked about that a
globe is not flat it's round so we'd
have to change that a globe is a round
object that is a model of Earth that
would be true so we have to change the
sentence to make it true so it's false
that sentence is false
number 2 an ocean is a very large area
of land does that sound right land I
don't know about that an ocean is a very
large area of land and ocean is a hard
surface does that sound right that
doesn't sound right that's false how do
we change it well there's two ways one
way we just say land we change that to
water and that would be true and ocean
is a very large area of water yes my Jo
that is correct or we could change it
another way we could keep this keep it
the same don't change keep it the same
as land and then just change this to a
continent a continent is a very large
area of land that's true so there's two
ways we could change this sentence but
in any case we have to change it so it's
not true it is false number three a
compass rose remember we talked about
compass rose is a symbol that shows
directions on maps so a compass rose
where do we find it on maps what does it
do
it shows directions so a compass rose is
a symbol that shows directions on maps
is that true do you remember when we
talked about compass rose that is true
absolutely so number three is true okay
that wraps it up for the vocabulary
section talking about the earth stay
with us we're gonna take a short break
we're gonna come back and talk about the
reading section so don't go away okay
welcome back we're going to go over the
reading section and what is our unit
called of course here on earth so the
reading passage we're gonna be talking
about the earth where we live now the
first sentence is our topic sentence the
planet where we live is called Earth so
here's our subject the planet here is
the idea the controlling idea where we
live is called Earth so the planet where
we live the planet where we live is
called Earth okay so that's what we call
Earth we all live there right we don't
live on the moon not yet we all live on
Earth now what is Earth made up of
in the vocabulary section we talked
about two things but actually there's
another thing right it is made up of air
water and land we talked about water and
land but if you think about it it's also
made up of air without air we wouldn't
be able to live and the earth has an
atmosphere we call that the air so land
water air those three things are what we
are concerned about are that's what we
know about very well because that's the
surface of the earth it is made up of
air water and land a very large area of
land is called a continent North America
is a continent where most people speak
English so we look at this right we're
talking about air water and land
now even though they they talked about
land last so they then they talk about a
very large area of land in the first
description so you know maybe that's not
very good ordering but that's the way
that this passage is a very large area
of land is called a continent so we get
more definition about land we get more
details about what land is and we get an
example North America is a continent
right so continent what is an example of
a continent North America what about
North America what's unique about North
America where most people speak English
Jew Canadians and Americans speak
English but not everybody it says most
not all because North America also
includes Mexico and Cuba and Haiti and
some other Caribbean nations where
people don't speak English as their
native language they speak Spanish as
their native language so it's not all
people it's most people most people
speak English in North America there are
more Canadians and Americans than people
in Mexico or other Caribbean nations ok
on earth there is more water than land
and that's true right there the amount
of water is much
more than the amount of land the land
the Earth's surface is mostly water you
may not realize that but if you take a
look at a globe or a map you can see
there's a lot more water than there is
land so there is more water than land
what do we call the large areas of water
we call those oceans and ocean what is
an ocean it is a large body of salt
water salt water not freshwater
saltwater if the earth is so big how can
we find new places
of course this is a big problem a long
long time ago when people didn't have
Globes and they didn't have maps that
showed very faraway places because they
didn't know about those places right
five hundred six hundred seven hundred
years ago people didn't know a lot of
people didn't know the earth was around
they thought it was flats and they
didn't know about if you lived in Europe
a lot of people didn't know about Asia
or Africa they had no idea about North
America or South America so how did
people find their directions how did
people find out where to go well they
used a compass rose
they used a globe and they used maps
okay well after they found out the earth
was round then they made globes so if
it's so big how can we find new places
we can use a compass rose we can use
globes we can find maps and we can look
at the earth of course we can just get
on a plane airplane and buy a ticket to
somewhere but if you want to know
yourself use these things
find out where different countries are
plan a trip it's very interesting okay
we can use these things we can use these
things to discover places on the earth
so that's a very interesting thing to do
if you have a globe at home take a look
at it if you don't have a globe take a
look at a world map look at all the
different countries look where they are
where do you want to go you could go
anywhere right that you want to go when
you get older when you get into college
take it
somewhere very good experience for you
but take a look at a globe take a look
at a map you can discover places on the
earth you'll be very happy and surprised
and it will be very educational to
travel now we can use a globe to plan
our trip so if you do have a globe take
a look at it figure out where do you
want to go then we should use a compass
rose and map to find our direction right
then you can use a map find the compass
rose and you can figure out the
direction you need to go in take a look
at a globe try and plan a trip to a fun
new continent so if you're in Asia think
about where do you want to go do you
want to go to South America do you want
to go to Africa think about that what
places do you want to go to what new
continents do you want to discover okay
so we have a video of the globe here and
we can see as it's turning around we can
see the different continents in the
different oceans we have ocean here the
Atlantic Ocean South America North
America
it looks very fuzzy doesn't it okay this
is the big ocean out of time but this is
a Pacific Ocean look at how big that is
it's really big and of course we have
Australia coming up into Asia Africa and
Europe up here and of course some people
call Europe and Asia the same continent
Eurasia but American kids are taught
that Europe and Asia are different
continents it depends on how you look at
it okay so that's a good video of the
earth the land and the water of the
earth now our reading skill here is main
idea and details our main idea is earth
is made up of air water and land now in
our vocabulary we were concentrating on
water and land but we also had mention
of air and you think about it that's
what Earth is made up of right we have
land where we live water the most of the
Earth's surface and air above us and you
know a few miles up into many kilometers
up into the sky is air and that's what
we're concerned about those
things that we need to live right so
this is our main idea and we have three
details that support the main idea in
each of these three details there's a
blank we have to fill in those blanks
with these words here ocean globe
continent let's take a look first detail
a large area of lanced a very large area
of land is called what ocean globe or
continent we just talked about this
right before so this is a continent so a
large area of land is called
a continent second detail now we're
talking about a large body of salt water
before we were talking about land land
is continent a large area of land is a
continent now a large body of salt water
is called what an ocean right
remember it's salt water if you look on
a map or you look on a globe you will
see large bodies of water between North
America between Canada and America in
North America but between Canada and
America there are some very large bodies
of water but they are not saltwater
they're freshwater you know Lake
Superior Lake Michigan these are
freshwater they're not saltwater so we
don't call them oceans we call them
lakes so it has to be saltwater before
we call it an ocean it's a very big or
large area of water
third detail a compass rose beep and be
a map sorry that's not a beat and map
are things to discover places on the
earth width so we talked about that if
you want to discover new places on the
earth what can you use you can use a
compass rose a map and what else down
here of course it's a globe a compass
rose a globe and a map are things that
you can use to discover the earth with
our new places on earth with ok let's
move on to our reading comprehension
questions what is a very large area of
land called so we're looking for a very
large area
of land do we call it a continent and
ocean or a globe we just talked about
continent right so hopefully your memory
is good a large area of land is called a
continent not an ocean ocean is a large
area of water and a globe is just a
model of the earth okay number two Earth
is made up of made up of we talked about
three things that the earth is made up
of one of them of course is water what
are the other two a and salt water the
earth is made up of water and salt water
that doesn't make sense and that's not
true anyway there's three things not not
two and these these are very similar
that wouldn't make sense right what
about the hard surface of the land oh
yeah earth is made up of water land and
air there's three things right and is it
true sure water land and air those are
the three things earth is made up of so
that's true
thus no choice sea water
continents and compasses the earth is
made up of compasses that's crazy right
that would have to be a lot of compasses
right so to make up the earth to help
make up the earth that would be very
terrible there'd be a lot of trash
wouldn't a lot of plastic laying around
so of course that's that's a silly right
so sea is not the correct answer B is
the correct answer
for number two let's move on to number
three North America is a continent where
what is special about North America it's
a continent where something is true
something is unique maybe about that
continent a most people speak English
North America is a continent where most
people speak English is that true yeah
that's true I remember I talked about
most people not all people but most
people in North America speak English
that's true let's look at B and C for
practice B most people live in the ocean
now I'm from America
and I don't remember most people living
in the ocean in North America that's
crazy
maybe someday people will live under the
ocean
or in the ocean it's possible but we're
not there yet
and besides most people probably won't
live in the ocean they'll still be
living on land so that's very silly okay
see most people uses compass roses well
first of all we have a grammatical
problem here most people should be use
so obviously right there we know C is
incorrect right and it's very silly to
say it's a continent where most people
use compass roses that has no connection
to what we're talking about so C is not
a good answer either
so a most people speak English that's
what we talked about in the reading
passage let's move on to number four
what are things we can use to plan a
trip to another continent what are
things we can use to plan a trip to
another continent so we want to go to
another continent what are some of the
things we can use we talked about this
before a we can use an ocean which is a
large body of salt water well first of
all we're work we're looking for things
plural and this only gives us one thing
so just on that basis alone we we're
kind of suspicious of a we don't think
it's a good answer because it only says
one thing but we're looking for many
things more than one so that's that
right there that's that's a little
strange but let's look at it a little
bit closer we can use an ocean which is
a large body of salt water but you know
we need more things and we don't really
use an ocean to plan a trip to the
another continent it doesn't sound right
and again of course we're looking for
more than one thing so a is not correct
what about B we can use a globe but
should not use a map now again globe is
just one thing and then we're saying we
should not use a map so we're not saying
there's two things we should only use a
globe so we should only use a globe we
can't use a map that's not that doesn't
sound right
so that's incorrect see we can use a map
compass rose sorry and a globe so one
two three ah what
two or three things plural that's what
we're looking for what are things we can
use to plan a trip to another continent
one two three these are things and they
are the correct things a map a compass
rose and a globe are the things we use
to plan a trip to another continent we
can use these things so C is the correct
answer in this case okay let's take a
look here we see again the chart of the
earth now there's no there's no blanks
to fill in but let's just summarize our
unit with this picture here of course we
see the map of the world this is a two
dimensional map it's a flat map right
you can spread it out that's what we
have here a map is flat but a globe is
round right so a map is flat a globe is
round just like Earth so that's what
we're talking about here remember
there's different advantages and
disadvantages to a map and a globe a map
you can fold up put it in your bag a
globe is very awkward very hard to carry
around with you right okay but both a
map and a globe they both show Earth's
land and water so both a map and the
globe show Earth's land and water and we
talked about that in this lesson we
talked about the water of the earth and
we also talked about the land of the
earth and we said that the water was
oceans there are five oceans right we
have the Pacific Ocean the art I'm sorry
Atlantic Ocean so Pacific Ocean which is
over here too right Pacific Ocean
Atlantic Ocean Indian Ocean and up here
on the top we can't see it because of
these words the Arctic Ocean the Arctic
Ocean so there's many different oceans
on earth there's many different
continents or land right we have North
America South America we have Africa
here we have Europe which is here kind
of small compared to Asia right Asia is
very big and we have Australia is there
one I'm missing yeah it
Antarctica and again you can see down
here NRK but take a look at this
Antarctica looks huge right it's bigger
than all the other ones well this is the
problem with the map because it's flat
like I said before if you go to the
bottom
it makes things appear a lot larger than
they really are but if you look at a
globe you see that Antarctica is
actually a lot smaller than it looks
like on a map because of the difference
2d vs. 3d okay but anyway we use a map
or a globe to find places on the earth
and remember you have a compass rose
that you can use on a map so our unit
here was here on earth and as we can see
we're talking about different places or
different features of the earth there is
a lot of land that we live on but
there's more ocean than there is land
it's very interesting and like the
reading passage says take a map of the
world look at it it's very fascinating
sometimes I like to look at a map of the
world and think about you know where
have I been where do I want to go right
we all think about places to travel and
it's maybe more interesting to look at a
globe because that's more accurate it's
more interesting to look at a globe than
it is on a map because it's real it's it
looks like the earth it's a model of the
earth so that's a good idea after this
lesson why don't you take a look at a
map take a look at a globe think about
where you want to go someday in your
future plan a trip make it a good one
anyway that wraps up our a lesson for
today we'll see you guys next time
take care everybody
