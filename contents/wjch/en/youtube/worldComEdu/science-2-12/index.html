Sound is a kind of energy that you can hear. Sound is made when something vibrates. Vibrate means to move back and forth quickly. When you talk or sing, place your hand on the side of your neck. Then you will feel your neck vibrating. When you hit a drum, it vibrates. Air around the drum vibrates too. When the air reaches your ears, you hear the sound. There are loud sounds and soft sounds. The volume of a sound is how loud or soft a sound is. When you yell , you make a loud sound. When you whisper , you make a soft sound. All sound has pitch. Pitch is how high or low a sound is. A drum is an instrument with a low pitch.</p>

hello everybody welcome back to American
textbook reading
I'm Brian Stewart are you listening well
to me now can you hear me is the sound
okay that's what we're going to talk
about in lesson 12 sound right now
you're listening to me the sound from my
voice is reaching your ears how does
that happen in this lesson you will
discover how we hear sounds so how is it
possible for you to listen to me right
now how can we hear different sounds
with our ears different sounds are there
big sounds or they're very pleasant
sounds let's take a look this is a very
interesting lesson sound of course when
we talk about sound sound is the energy
you can hear I'm making energy with my
mouth right now you are hearing that
energy with your ears so sound is
actually energy that's very interesting
to think about isn't it
sound is energy just like electricity or
heat is energy sound is also another
kind of energy and we can feel that
sound we can hear that sound we can hear
that energy we can find out or we can
detect that energy how do we detect it
how do we feel that energy how can we
human beings how do we know what that
energy is and how can we figure out
what's going on because energy the
energy of sound has to do with vibrating
vibrate to move back and forth quickly
right very quickly like vibrating right
so you're berating right back and forth
that's a lot of energy now I'm making my
throat inside my throat I'm making my
vocal cords my vocal cords my vocal
cords are vibrant
and it's making the air coming out of my
mouth vibrate also now when we talk
about vibrate right now I was going like
this we can also see a video of
vibrating this is a different way right
we're not talking about vocal cords here
vocal cords are what i vibrate in my
mouth to make you hear what I'm saying
but other things vibrate and make noise
too let's take a look at a video now
this of course this tool is called a
jackhammer oops what am I doing here
ignore that Jack hammer a jackhammer is
the tool that he's using to break up the
ground now let's take a look at this and
listen carefully see if you can hear the
sound that the jackhammer makes right
can you hear it okay if I'm using it
right that's really causing a lot of
vibration right and the vibration is
really needed to break up the ground or
the cement the asphalt of the street and
basically of course it makes a lot of
vibration to do that but that vibration
is energy it's creating a sound and we
can hear that sound if we're in the city
and there's a lot of construction going
on we can hear jackhammers we hear that
sound it's a very common sound in the
city okay let's move on and talk about
pitch now of course we're talking about
sounds right but as you know there are
many different kinds of sounds right
when we talk about sounds we can talk
about two things that that to describe
different sounds one of those things is
pitch pitch means how high or how low a
sound is so if we have a high sound it's
a very high pitch or we have a very low
sound
right so high or low what is the sound
if you have a little puppy dog at home
right he's going alright that's a high
sound when that puppy dog grows into a
big dog he goes ruff
rope rope right that's a low sound so
the vocal cords in a dog will change
from a baby to a bigger dog right so
it's interesting to think about pitch
because we can describe sound by its
pitch is it a high pitched sound or a
low pitch sound so with pitch we can say
high pitched sound this is our adjective
to describe what kind of sound and again
of course we could say low pitched sound
oops sorry
TCH Edie so high pitched low pitched
what is the pitch of the sound and we
can use that word to describe
specifically a little bit more detail
about that sound is it a high pitch or a
low pitch
some people have voices that are high
pitched some people have voices that are
low pitched ok we can talk about that
using the word pitch ok
now be careful this is yell right I'm
saying be careful because yell means to
shout in fact they're both the same
meaning if you say don't yell right be
careful don't yell you guys I know you
want to yell a lot when you're happy and
you're having a good time but don't yell
inside don't shout in your classroom
right don't yell don't shout yell and
shout are basically the same words don't
yell in the classroom don't yell in the
library right when you're at school or
in a public place many people are around
don't yell don't shout go to the
playground okay you can yell shout run
around on the playground but try not to
yell or shout especially when you're in
a building
please because other people don't like
that right it's too loud of a sound okay
so yell means to shout let's take a look
at a video of two kids who are going to
shout why are they shouting usually when
people shout it's because they're upset
or angry
you can also shout if you're happy but
what happens in this video let's take a
look here we see a young boy who's
driving his car he comes to a stop right
oh and he gets hit by another boy now
they are shouting they are yelling so ok
I think they're done ok so they are
shouting or yelling yelling at each
other this is a good expression to use
when two people are fighting right they
had some accident now they're fighting
they are yelling at each other yelling
at each other or shouting at each other
usually when two people have an argument
they are yelling or shouting at each
other okay when people yell or shout
what's their voice right their voice
becomes very big right we're talking
about volume volume is how loud or soft
a sound is loud or soft loud or soft
right so before we talked about pitch
pitch is high or low volume is another
useful word to describe different sounds
we can talk about loud sounds or we can
talk about soft sounds okay so volume
describes how loud or soft a sound is on
many of your most of you guys nowadays
almost everybody has music players right
and you have a volume control a volume
control on your electronic device in
fact on the computer right now you're
listening to me there is a volume
control device you can increase you can
increase
the sound you can make it louder or you
can decrease you can decrease the sound
make it softer so you can increase the
sound or decrease the sound you can make
it softer you can turn this dial up turn
the volume up or turn the volume down
those are good expressions to turn the
volume turn the volume up turn the
volume up means turn it up it's too soft
I can't hear it make it louder turn the
volume down means it's too loud turn the
volume down usually your parents will
say hey turn the volume down if you're
listening to music on your stereo or on
your you know outside speakers external
speakers turn the volume down make the
volume softer if you're at your friend's
house your friend wants to hear your
music hey turn the volume up right I
want to hear it so how loud or soft a
sound is depends on the volume of that
sound so remember there's two words we
use to describe sound pitch how high or
low a sound is volume how loud or soft
of sound is pitch and volume are good
words to use when we describe different
sounds okay whisper now when we talk
about whisper are we talking about pitch
or are we talking about volume the
definition of whisper is whisper means
to speak quietly or softly quietly or
softly right now you might have to turn
the volume up to hear me when I whisper
right so whisper we're talking about
volume right whisper means a volume that
is down the volume that is soft a soft
sound is all whispering what is
whispering the AAPIs
we just learned a few seconds ago
another word that is the opposite of
whisper so you can either hey you know
yell at your friend or you can whisper
to your friend Shh don't tell anybody
right
that is whisper this boy is whispering
to the other boy he better be whispering
if he's yelling this boy will get very
angry right so he's whispering whisper
means to speaks quietly or softly where
should you whisper it's better to
whisper in class or especially in the
library don't make a loud sound make a
soft sound whisper to your friends in
the classroom or in the library if
you're talking to each other much better
than yelling okay now we can talk about
different instruments or different
things that make sounds here we see a
picture of a drum do you like do you
like playing a drum you can play a drum
a drum is a musical instruments that you
can play we play musical instruments you
play them play the drums can you play
the drums do you like to play the drums
that you hit with your hands or a stick
so here we see a stick is can hit the
drum but you can also use your hands
right some people from different
countries or different cultures they use
their hands to hit the drums and they're
very good at it it makes a very
interesting and energetic fun sound okay
another instrument that we can hear is a
bell a bell is a device it can also be
an instrument that makes a ringing sound
ding ding ding ding ding so here listen
to that sound ding ding ding ding ding
that's kind of a high-pitched sound it's
a loud sound because a bell sound can
travel very far right so usually when
people want to get another person's
attention they go ding ding ding ding
high-pitched but loud sound okay
especially but by the way a big bell
right dong dong dong that's a lower
pitch sound but it's also very very loud
and people can hear for a long ways away
think of the bells in a church right
those are very it's a very loud sound if
you're standing close to it
well you can't hear very well because
the sound is so big you can't hear
anything else okay we can talk about hi
we've talked about that before hi means
large in a mount or degree in this case
we're talking about degree when we talk
about sound they don't want to talk
about the amount of sound we talk about
the degree of sound because we're not
saying wow that's a lot of sound we say
well that sound is there's a there's a
very big sound it's a degree it's a high
sound so when you turn up the volume
you're turning up the degree of that
sound so when you turn up the volume of
the sound to a high volume you're
talking about degree you're not really
talking about amount you're talking more
about degree what is the degree of that
sound but you we usually just say and
the volume is very high or the volume is
very low small in amount or degree so
the difference of course is a big or
small high is large in a mounted or
degree and low is small in a mount or
degree okay how do we hear sound see we
have a good chart here we can see kind
of like cause and effect right over here
we have the cause we have what's making
the sound here we have the effect what
is the result we hear that sound
here the causes when you hit a drum the
drum vibrates right my voice is
vibrating okay so we can see that let's
take a look at a video of that to see
what's going on here we have a drum
listen
there you can hear the drum making the
sound of course in the background you
can also hear the those are the pipes we
can't see the pipes the pipes are more
high-pitched sound the drum is a more
low-pitched sound but we can see as this
player is hitting the surface of the
drum with the sticks the dented
right it's making a sound that we can
hear and that's what's going on it's
vibrating the the surface of the drum
that sound is is amplified or made
bigger by the shape of the drum and we
can hear that sound very well so when
somebody hits the drum the drum vibrates
right and that vibration moves through
the air the air around the drum vibrates
as well those vibrations in the air we
can't see them but we can hear them
that's what our ears are used for we
hear the sound so if you hit a drum the
air vibrates and we all can hear that
sound right because those vibrations
move through the air around us we can't
see those vibrations we can't see them
but we can hear them that's what our
ears are for so that we can pick up
sounds we can pick up sounds we can hear
sounds we can also you could say you can
pick up the sound we pick up the sound
with our ear that is what hearing is we
hear the sound okay let's go on to the
exercise we're going to match each word
with its definition okay so here we have
our words at the top volume yell sound
whisper vibrate and pitch here are our
definitions here let's take a look at
the first definition to move back and
forth quickly like like this right what
is that do you remember that word of
course to move back and forth very
quickly that means to vibrate vibrate
okay so to vibrate means to move back
and forth quickly that's what causes a
lot of sounds remember my vocal cords
are vibrating the drum is vibrating the
jackhammer is vibrating okay these
things vibrate
that causes sound to to speak quietly or
softly right what is that is that to
yell no it's the opposite of to yell it
is to whisper to talk quietly whisper to
your friends when you're inside for
example a library a church classroom if
you're talking to your friends and you
don't want to disturb your teacher
probably you shouldn't talk to your
friends too much in the classroom anyway
but if you do whisper don't yell okay
number three the energy that you can
hear so there is energy right what is
the energy that we're hearing what
energy am I making now that you can hear
of course we're talking about sound
sound is the energy that we can hear
it's the vibration in the air number
four how high our lowest sound is so
when we're talking about sound and we
describe sound right there's a couple of
different ways we can describe sound we
learned two words to describe sound in
this case we want to know high or low if
a if a sound is or no what am I talking
about I'm talking about pitch so some
people have a very high pitched voice
some people of all very low pitched
voice okay so we're talking about pitch
high or low okay higher low how higher
or lowest sound is we're talking about
pitch number five to shout we talked
about this before shout is exactly the
same as yell don't yell ok I'm sorry
that's not really yelling I don't really
want to yell because I don't want to
disturb you too much right yelling or
shouting try not to yell or shout when
you're playing you're running around
sure that's good you can yell or shout
or playing a sports game people yell and
shout if people get angry at each other
they also yell and shout but try not to
do that right just be calm about it try
to work it out with your friend
try not to yell or shout too much number
six how loud voices or sound is we talk
about loud or soft we're talking of
course about the volume over here the
volume of a sound okay so if we say that
the the sound is very loud somebody's
speaking in a very loud voice or soft
somebody's speaking in a soft voice then
we're talking about volume usually you
should speak in a louder voice not too
loud but if you want other people to
hear you
they might say speak up speak up excuse
me I can't hear you
would you speak up that means you have
to increase the loudness of your voice
right you have to turn the volume up on
your voice speak up so I can hear you
okay so those are some good words of
course we learn these words and that's
how to match these words to these
definitions let's take a look at our
chart here remember we're talking about
two ways to describe sounds right
there's two easy ways to describe sound
we can talk about volume we can talk
about pitch let's take a look volume is
how loud or soft a sound is we have two
pictures here one is a picture of a jet
airplane the other pictures of two girls
looks like they're sharing a secret
right which sound do you think is loud
or soft let's take a look at the video
we have a video of the jet plane let's
take a look at that here's the jet plane
listen carefully is it loud or soft
Wow okay that's a loud sound right if
you're close to the jet airplane
especially if you're at the airport if
you ever go to the airport and you see
the airplanes taking off wow it's really
really loud the loud sound and the
airport workers on the ground they have
protection they're wearing headphones
are a protection for their ears because
the sound is too loud it could hurt
their ears so jet planes and airplanes
are usually very loud in the sound now
let's take a look at these two girls
here they are talking they're sharing a
secret okay can we hear
I I don't know I can't get that what Hey
I can't hear what they're saying oh here
comes somebody else
oh no she couldn't hear either ah
whatever they said it's a it's probably
pretty funny now she's laughing but we
don't know what they said yeah because
it's too soft they were whispering to
each other so maybe I'll have to ask her
later hey what did you say to your
friend because it looks very funny but I
couldn't hear it because they are
whispering this volume was very soft so
we seeked a couple of examples a jet
airplane very loud sound but whispering
two girls talking to each other they're
sharing a secret we can't hear what
they're saying let's move on so that's
talking about volume but let's move on
to pitch okay pitch is how high or low a
sound is we have two pictures here we
have a wolf right
a wolf in the woods howling oh right
sounds a little bit like a high pitch
unfortunately we don't have a video for
that but I can howl like a wolf right
it's kind of a high-pitched voice and
also especially young wolf pups they
right there they're barking but they're
they're just still babies so they're
they have a high-pitched sound or
high-pitched bark over here think about
this this is a thunderstorm right so we
can see the lightning and what do you
hear after lightning can be very scary
right let's take a look at the video but
don't get scared okay it's just a video
don't worry okay so here we have the
area the the land
it looks very dark it's at night and the
clouds are moving in looks like it's
going to rain here let's take a look Oh
the Lightning is coming down
and you here right after the lightening
the boom-boom right very low and deep
sound of the Thunder and that's pitch
right so before we saw the wolf right
the woman very high pitched and during a
thunderstorm boom boom the thunder is
very low pitched right it's very low
pitched okay so we can talk about two
different things about sound we can talk
about volume and we can talk about pitch
okay let's take a look at the a little
quiz here we have pictures and we need
to choose the correct answer for each
picture so remember we're talking about
volume loud volume soft volume we're
also talking about pitch high pitch low
pitch let's take a look at the picture
of number one number one is a kitty cat
think about a kitty cat how what does a
kitty cat sound like it goes right so we
have a or b a is loud sound B is soft
sound which one do you think is correct
does a cat a baby can't make a loud
sound or does a baby cat make a soft
sound well of course it makes a soft
sound you may hear it but you're like
it's not very loud you're like am i
hearing that where is that coming from
then you go find where that little baby
cat is number two we have what is this
here this is an alarm clock whoops here
let's do it this way alarm clock now the
important part of this word is alarm
alarm it's got to wake you up in the
morning right it's got to wake you up in
the morning so it's got to be loud but
what about the pitch does it have a high
pitch or a low pitch do you have an
alarm clock
does it go or does it go right if it
goes it's a high pitch if it goes that's
a low pitch okay what do you think your
alarm clock does of course your alarm
clock makes a high pitch okay it makes a
high pitch sound and that's your alarm
clock
okay over here we saw the thunderstorm
so we can talk about that too not only
is the thunderstorm loud but it is also
boom boom boom boom what is that that is
a low pitch so thunderstorm is a low
pitch in fact low pitch is you know it's
a low pitch mmm the vibration is really
strong so even if you're in your house
during a thunderstorm that pitch is very
low deep
it makes a big vibration that's a lot of
energy you can even feel the Thunder you
don't just hear it sometimes you can
feel it it's so strong and that of
course is a thunderstorm okay let's move
on to our true/false questions in number
one we have volume is how loud or soft a
sound is so remember we're talking about
two ways to describe sounds volume and
pitch we talked about volume we're
talking about loud or soft is that
correct absolutely that is correct
because volume is how loud or soft a
sound is pitch is how high or low a
sound is but we're not talking about
high or low we're talking about loud or
soft okay number two when you yell you
make a quiet sound so remember the video
those two boys they're yelling at each
other yelling at each other and you
dummy you hit me you hit my card they're
talking very loudly they're not talking
softly so that's incorrect it's false
right you make when you yell you make a
loud sound not a quiet sound so that's
false number three when you whisper you
make a quiet sound same thing right soft
and quiet are the same so is that true
yes absolutely it is true when you
whisper you make a quiet sound when you
yell you make a loud sound so whisper
and yell are opposites okay that wraps
it up for right now we're going to take
a short break
come back and look at the reading
section okay welcome back we're going to
go over the reading passage for this
unit and of course our topic is sound
sound remember we talked about before
sound is interesting it's actually
energy sound is a kind of energy that
you can hear energy that you can hear so
it's a kind of energy there's lots of
different kinds of energy right but this
is an energy that you can hear okay so
that's the type of energy a kind of
energy that you can hear sound is made
sound is made how a sound made when
something vibrates very important
remember we talked about vibrate what
does vibrate mean it means to move back
and forth quickly to move back and forth
very quickly right so it's very
interesting we are vibrating our vocal
chords our vocal cords are moving back
and forth very quickly it makes the air
move very quickly you can hear it
especially if I speak loudly
so vibrate means to move back and forth
quickly sound is made when something
vibrates so what is vibrating either I'm
making my vocal chords vibrate or I'm
making a drum vibrate the surface of the
drum or I'm making the metal part of a
bell vibrate by hitting it and it makes
a sound all these things all these
sounds are caused by vibration okay when
you talk or sing place your hand on the
side of your neck so right now I'm
talking right now if I got my hand on
the side of my neck I can feel my neck
vibrating why don't you guys try it say
something say when you talk or sing
ready when you talk or sing you can feel
the side of your neck vibrating those
are my vocal cords that are vibrating
then you will feel your neck vibrating
when you
a drum it vibrates air around the drum
also vibrates right the air carries this
sound when the air reaches your ears you
hear the sound okay so the air will
reach your ears the but the air is
vibrating right so when that vibration
when that vibration in the air reaches
your ears it comes to your ears that's
when you hear the sound remember to hear
is one of your senses right so that's
how we hear sound that's how we detect
or pick up sound in the environment
around us okay let's take a look at a
video of somebody playing a guitar now
in this case what do you think is
vibrating these are the strings of the
guitar right and this is the body of the
guitar of course the person playing that
guitar is making the strings vibrate
let's take a look
okay you can see how they're making the
strings vibrate and look it up here the
guy's got his hands he's making that
string shorter or longer when he pushes
it down that string becomes shorter it
makes a different sound than if he
vibrated a long string because if you
think about it if the string is very
long that vibration takes a longer time
to vibrate that string takes a longer
time to vibrate but if you make this
string shorter the string vibrates more
quickly so it makes a different sound
it's very interesting okay of course the
body of the guitar takes that sound and
makes it louder so that we can hear it
and that's what the hole in the in the
guitar sound goes in there and it makes
it louder
did you notice too at the beginning he
tapped the drum he hit the drum to kind
of get his beat his rhythm going okay so
that's another way to make a sound with
the guitar okay
there are loud sounds and of course
there are soft sounds okay most of the
time though the sound is in between not
really loud not really soft kind of in
between I'm not speaking to you in a
loud voice I'm not speaking to you in a
soft voice I'm speaking to you in a
medium voice so there are loud sounds
soft sounds and also medium sounds okay
but we'll talk about loud sounds and
soft sounds here the volume of a sound
is how loud or soft a sound is so yeah
medium is louder than soft but softer
than loud it's in between the volume of
sound is how loud or soft it is when you
yell when you yell aren't you making a
loud sound or a soft sound you make a
loud sound yelling is a loud sound when
you whisper when you whisper you make a
soft sound okay when you whisper you
make a soft sound so these kids are
yelling they're making a very loud sound
these kids are whispering they're making
a very soft sound so we're talking about
volume
here also we can talk about pitch just
as all sound has volume all sound has
pitch pitch we were talking about how
high or low a sound is so high or low
low or high pitch is how high or lowest
sound is a drum when we talk about a
drum a drum is an instrument with a low
pitch right let's the drum right it's
making a low pitch sound okay but a bell
if we ring about right
that's an instrument with a high pitch
okay so remember the drum that's a low
pitch belt that's a high pitch okay so
there's two main ways we can describe
sounds well with volume loud or soft
with pitch high pitch or low pitch okay
so what we're doing here we're comparing
and contrasting that's our reading skill
chart we can talk about sound how is
sound alike and how is sound different
of course it's very easy to talk about
differences because we have volume and
pitch to talk about the differences in
volume or pitch but sound is alike to
sound is alike sound is made when
something what so all sounds are alike
all sounds are the same when you do
something here are words loud volume
vibrates or pitch sound is made when
something what ah vibrates right here
right because that's our verb sound is
made when something vibrates moves back
and forth very quickly so when something
vibrates a sound is made that vibration
is energy remember that's energy that's
making the sound okay how are they
different here we have beep of a sound
is how beep wow this is really difficult
or softest sound is our key word of
course here is soft right so when we're
talking about we can talk about volume
or weak
talk about pitch right so we're talking
about the soft if a sound is soft it is
what we're talking about what are what
what aspect or what descriptive word can
we use to talk about sound we're talking
about of course volume there can be a
soft volume what's the opposite of a
soft volume the opposite is loud so the
volume volume of a sound is how loud or
soft a sound is so in that case we're
talking about volume how about here
the other word that we can use to
describe sounds or to talk about sounds
when we talk about how high or how low a
sound is something of a sound is how
high or low we of course are talking
about pitch what is the pitch so we can
say what is the volume what is the pitch
is it loud is a volume high or is it a
low sound is it a low pitch of the sound
so two basically two basic things and
it's interesting to note too when we
talk about volume a volume can be loud
and high-pitched what is a loud
high-pitched sound well think about if
your dog is hurt hopefully not you go
right that's very loud and high-pitched
right hopefully your dog doesn't get
hurt but sometimes you know something
hits the dog or you know one time I was
throwing a ball and the ball hit the dog
right on the nose and I think it hurt
the dog right right so made a very loud
and high-pitched noise you could also
have loud and low pitched right that's
the thunder in the thunderstorm we heard
before
sorry missing that up low pitched a very
loud and low pitched sounds like thunder
in a thunderstorm
boom boom boom boom very it's it's loud
but it's also low pitched of course we
can do the same soft and high-pitched
and soft and low-pitched okay so we can
mix these two get many different common
Asians many different kinds of sounds
okay let's take a look at the reading
comprehension questions sound is made
when an object what remember an object
has to do what in order to make sound it
vibrates hears or feels does an object
here is an object here does does this
pen hear things now of course that
doesn't have ears that's not right
does an object feel oh how do you feel
today pen no that's that's kind of
strange right no an object doesn't feel
of course an object vibrates when an
object vibrates it makes sound sound is
made when an object vibrates that's how
sound is made that's how all sound is
made a bell is an instrument with what
remember we talked about the Bell ding
is that what is that a low pitch dun dun
dun no it's ding ding ding that's a high
pitch so a Bell is an instrument with a
high pitch not no pitch if we said
there's no pitch that means no sound
right all sound has pitch and volume if
it doesn't have pitch it's not a sound
if it doesn't have volume it's not a
sound
so all sound has pitch and volume so it
either has a low pitch or a high pitch
if you say it has no pitch it's not a
sound right it doesn't make any sound ok
let's move on to number three when
vibrating air when the air that we can't
see it but when the vibrations in the
air reaches our ears reaches our ears so
when that vibration in the air comes to
our ears then what we hear the sound we
see the sound or the pitch is higher
well obviously it's a we hear the sound
because that's what our ears are doing
we're hearing it it's interesting to
note if the sound is here I don't hear
it yet I have to wait until the sound
hits my ears so that's very interesting
when you think about it because
sometimes Jets airplanes will travel
through the sky there
fast and they will travel so fast they
are going faster than the speed of sound
so if I was on in the airplane I
couldn't hear it because I'm going too
fast
that's the vibration in the air hasn't
reached my ears yet because I'm going
past that I'm going too fast the
vibration in the air can't hit me so I'm
going faster then whoops then the speed
faster than the speed of sound remember
that video we saw of the jet that jet
can go faster than the speed of sound so
the vibration in the air is not fast
enough to keep up with the jet is very
very interesting anyways you hear a
sound when the vibrating ear reaches
your ears you don't see the sound your
eyes cannot see the sound we can't see
the vibrations in the air the pitch is
higher when it hits your ears that
doesn't make sense the pitch is the same
throughout okay it doesn't change when
it hits your ears so of course the only
right answer is a how about number four
if you do not want many people to hear
you you have a secret to tell you don't
want anybody else to know what should
you do
you shouldn't yell no absolutely not
if you don't want anybody to know that
information don't yell right everybody
will hear you you should hit a drum boom
boom boom hey I've got something to say
no you shouldn't hit a drum see you
should whisper softly remember to the
girl I couldn't hear what they were
saying so I don't I will not be able to
hear them I can't hear them so they are
whispering so if you don't want any more
many people to hear you you should
whisper you just want your friend or two
friends or three friends you just want
it now
then you should whisper don't yell
because that could be embarrassing
depending on what the secret is okay
let's move on to our chart how do we
hear sounds remember this is like cause
and effect what do we do first over here
what are we doing with
drum we're using these sticks and we're
hitting the drum right when you hit a
drum when you hit a drum the drum
vibrates that drum is vibrating okay
what happens then
that vibration transfers our goes into
the air right the air around the drum
vibrates too because that vibration well
that vibration transfers that vibration
transfers to the air the air around the
drum vibrates too and what happens that
air is going to reach this boy's ears
that's going to reach his ear and what
happens in that case we hear the sound
so when that vibration in the air
reaches the boys ears or our ears we
hear the sound
okay well this unit has been about sound
and is very interesting we looked at how
sound is made it's an energy that
vibrates that vibration is transferred
to the air around us when it reaches our
ears we can hear it remember there's two
ways to describe sound are two ways to
talk about sound you can talk about the
volume and you can talk about the pitch
okay very interesting lesson hope you've
learned a lot we'll see you guys again
next time take care</p></div>
