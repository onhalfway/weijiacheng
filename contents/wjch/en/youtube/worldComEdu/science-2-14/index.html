<p>If a car, person, animal, or other thing is in motion , it is moving.</p>
<p>Things move at different speeds .A car moves fast, a person moves slowly. Things move in different ways. If you take the bus to school, you move quickly from your home to school. A train moves straight , but a train track can be curved . Force makes things move or stop. Force can change the speed of things. Pushes and pulls are forces. When you push an object, it moves away from you. When you pull an object it moves closer to you. A force that always pulls things down to the ground is gravity . When we drop an object, it falls because of gravity. </p>

hello everybody welcome back to American
textbook reading my name is Brian
Stewart hey in this lesson we've got a
little bit of a complicated lesson but
we're going over the idea of motion
this is lesson 14 and we're talking
about motion it's a little complicated
because we're going to talk about three
important ideas in this unit you will
discover force motion and gravity so
we're gonna be talking about force
motion that's our unit title and of
course gravity all of these things have
to do with the way that things move
things move from one place to another
how do they move we'll talk about the
forces we'll talk about the motion the
type of movement and we'll also talk
about gravity which is a very important
force in making things move let's take a
look first we're going to talk about
motion because that is our unit title
motion what exactly is motion right
motion is the act the act the action the
the physical thing that you're doing the
act of moving so you move from one place
to another place the act of moving that
is motion okay speed now when we talk
about motion we can talk about different
ways to move right movement can be fast
it can be slow okay it can have lots of
different directions right there can be
different reasons for motion but right
now we're talking about speed speed is
how fast something moves so like I said
something can move fast or it can move
slow right speed when we talk about fast
or slow we're talking about what is the
speed of the object whatever is moving
something is moving what is the speed of
that object
how fast is it moving if we see a car
wow that looks like it's moving very
fast right it's moving very fast it's
hard to see it right because it's moving
so quickly it has a lot of speed it has
a lot of speed now when we talk about
motion if an object if one thing is
going to move from here it's going to
move there there has to be some force
pushing it force is power right power
I'm using my power of my arm to move
this from here to there I'm using force
I don't have to use a lot of force it's
a very light pen but if you want to move
heavy objects you need a lot of force
you need a lot of power power that
produces a change in a movement and it's
interesting to notice that a change in a
movement
so remember movement isn't just stop
move stop movement can also be in one
direction and if something is already
moving something is already moving and a
power of force changes that motion
changes the direction that is also a
power or force that makes something
change direction a push or a pull is a
force so we have a push or a pull two
types of forces a push will talk about
these of course later but a push or a
pull are the two types of forces that
act upon objects it makes those objects
move we are either pushing them or we're
pulling them we'll talk about these
words later let's take a look at the
video though we're taking a look at a
crane this is a crane and you can see at
the top of the crane up here you see
this part is moving and that's the part
that holds the steel beam there building
a building here and this part they need
that part in a certain place on the
building so the crane will move it this
way right it'll pull it towards the
crane it will push it out away from the
crane but you know what this
can also pull up and down so they can
make these cables they can pull the
object up or they can let it go down and
they can move it up and down so a crane
of course they can move things away they
can pull things close but they can also
lift things and drop things so they can
move objects around where they need it
on this building so that's a good
example of the forces that you use to
make something move to put something
into motion now a very important force
gravity is a force right gravity is a
force that's what it says right here
it's a type of force a type a type of
force so we talked about forces right
forces the power to move something
gravity is a very important force that
pulls things to the ground right you see
this boy well he's very interesting he's
diving into the water hopefully there's
water down here but he's going down
right this arrow is pointing down
because gravity pulls things to the
ground let's take a look at that now all
these kids here are lined up they are
lined up on the edge of the pool they
are going to jump into the pool gravity
is the force that pulls them down there
they go yeah 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 then
they're all going in a line okay they're
having fun but basically gravity is the
force that pulls people up he missed out
he's like well what happened oh yeah he
jump in okay so he takes he jumps in the
air gravity pulls him down gravity is
very important of obviously gravity is
the force that's keeping us all on the
ground if we didn't have gravity we
would all float up into the air right so
gravity is a force or a power that is
always there it's always pulling us to
the earth and it's keeping us on the
ground without gravity we would just
float off right that would be very very
dangerous and very strange so we need
gravity gravity is something that's very
important obviously in our life
now we've talked about pull a little bit
right I said gravity pulls us to the
ground we also talked about pull and
push are the two major forces here we
have pull pull is a force that moves
things closer to you close nearby
yep a right closer to you so if I take
this pen and I pull it to me I'm
bringing the pen
closer to me now it's interesting when
we when we pull something with us right
we can pull it close to us and it stops
but if we keep moving right and we keep
pulling that's the way that we can bring
something from here to over there we
pull it along with us let's take a look
at a video of that see this man he's got
his two children here and he's pulling
them in the snow looks like fun right so
basically he's pulling them but he keeps
walking right so although he keeps
pulling them closer he keeps moving away
so it's a constant action and he's
pulling these kids across the snow so
pulling something across the snow he's
pulling them towards him but he doesn't
pull and stop he keeps moving so he's
pulling them from one place to another
and of course you can also say you know
pull stop that's okay too but if you
want to move something from one place to
a far away place well sure you can pull
it along with you pull it along behind
you okay now pull is one of the forces
that's bringing something closer to you
the opposite pandeiro the opposite force
of pull is push push is a force that
moves things away from you so before we
saw pull closer to you push is away from
you you're pushing something away so
it's another force that you use to push
away from you this girl is helping these
two boys on their skateboard right
they're on a skateboard here a skate
board
the girl is pushing them away from her
let's take a look at a video of this now
this is a very common scene right you
have a swing set this is a swing a swing
set right
this boy is on a swing mom and dad are
doing what they are pushing their
children away pushing them away of
course gravity is a force that pulls
them back down so there's two forces we
can see in this video
one is push away from human beings the
other force from gravity from the earth
is pulling them back down to the ground
and so we have forces we have two forces
one is pushing away the other force is
pulling back the one that's pushing away
is made by people people are making that
force and the other force is made by the
earth that's gravity pulls it back so we
have the constant motion back and forth
we're actually looking at two forces in
this video there are two forces okay now
when we talk about motion we can talk
about the direction direction direction
of something whoops direction that's
supposed to be a sea okay direction so
we talk about the direction of the
motion which way is it going which way
is that object going that is the
direction now something can go in a
straight direction straight means not
bent but another way to say that is that
there's no change in direction it starts
here a starts at Point a and finishes at
point B and it goes directly from A to B
there is no change in direction it's a
straight shot a straight line there is
no change in direction it goes directly
from point A to point B not bent bent
would be like you know this that's bent
okay that would be bad there's no Bend
it's straight straight line not bent
there's no bend in the direction the
direction stays the same the whole time
there's no change in direction the
direction stays the same it is going
straight that's the direction now of
course we can talk about straight is not
bent curve is like a bent curved curved
curved means not straight okay so we had
like opposites right straight means not
bent curved means not straight so curved
of course means bent okay and forming a
curve you see this train now here is
point a here is point B right it's not a
straight line a straight line would be
like this that's a straight line but
this is not a straight line this is a
curve right it's curving around it's
bent the train tracks are bent it's
forming a curve so we can say it's a
curve or it is curved curved as
adjective curve without D that's a noun
so we say there's a curve and the tracks
go around the curve that's a noun if we
say the tracks are curved that's an
adjective
okay so curved means not straight and
forming a curve that's our noun right
there okay now there are many different
types of motions we talked about
straight we talked about curved but
there's also zigzag and there's circle
let's take a look at each one in turn
these are all changing directions or
talking about directions like I talked
to you guys just before here we have the
idea straight we talked about straight
let's see another example as you can see
this man is swimming in a straight line
these lanes the lanes swimming lanes
there are lanes in a swimming pool the
lanes are straight the lanes are not
bent they're not curved they are
straight let's take a look so look at
this guy oh he's a very powerful swimmer
isn't he but he's swimming in a straight
line he is swimming along in a straight
line it comes on up out of the water of
course we can't see the lines but we
just have to assume
that when he's swimming he's a good
swimmer and he stays swimming in a
straight line and we can see that he's
not really changing direction he is not
changing direction he's swimming in a
straight line do you like to swim I do
like to swim
I should swim more though I don't have a
lot of time but swimming is a very good
exercise but yeah that looks good okay
so that's straight then we have curved
as you can see the road can curve now
the road can curve in both directions
right sometimes the road can curve to
the left it can curve back to the right
let's take a look at a video of a curved
road look at this road I think this is a
famous road in San Francisco here these
cars are traveling on a curved road the
road is curved okay so the cars are
going to have to go very slow because
obviously if they go fast they might hit
something it's easier to go fast if it's
straight but if it's Kurt slow down it's
dangerous to go too fast then we're
talking about speed right lower your
speed when you go down a curved road
okay because you don't want to get in
trouble you don't want it to be
dangerous okay so we've talked about
straight we've seen examples of curved
we talked about straight and curved but
how about some new directions let's talk
about zig zag that's a kind of funny
word isn't it
zig zag zig zag looks like a combination
straight then curved and then straight
and then you change direction you go
straight change direction so zig zag is
that you keep changing direction okay
but you are still going down a straight
line I mean he's still going from A to B
he's going kind of straight but he's
changing directions he's still gonna
wind up in the same place if he went on
a straight line but he keeps changing
directions but keeps coming back
that's zig zag let's take a look at the
video oh where are we we're on the
mountain looks like there's a lot of
snow looks like it could be a ski resort
let's take a look yep absolutely it's a
ski resort look at this guy he wants to
down the mountain right that could be a
straight line but he keeps changing the
direction he goes right and then he
turns and he goes left and then he goes
right again and then he goes straight
for a little while then he goes left the
thing is he keeps changing direction but
he's going the same direction all the
way down the mountain of course it was a
guy that's filming it he's just kind of
going along like this this guy is really
putting a lot of effort into it but he's
still going in in kind of a straight
down the mountain but he's using a
zigzag pattern
why is he doing that because if he goes
straight if he doesn't change his
direction
his speed will really get fast faster
and faster and faster
that's dangerous on the skis boom right
he'll hit something so he slows down by
changing his direction he goes slower
okay we'll go right slow or more
friction left right sorry right and then
he'll slow down actually I used to ski a
lot in America I was I really loved to
ski I go up in the mountains and go
skiing and I know you can't go straight
if I go straight sometimes I would go
straight you go really really fast and
it's a little dangerous it's a little
scary Wow really fast so slow down turn
and go down the mountain in a zigzag
pattern and that way you'll slow your
speed down it's safer to do that that
way because you don't want to really go
fast if you hit something oh that really
hurts
okay so slow down go in a zigzag pattern
oh yeah that's zigzag now we can also
talk about directions we can say circle
travel in a circle Travel whoops travel
in a circle that's travel in a circle we
can also call it sir q ler mo shun so
we're putting these two words together
our idea of motion circle is a noun but
we change circle to adjective form and
we have circular circular motion means
to go in a circle or travel in a
Circle travel in a circle that's
circular soup circular let's say it
together circular motion circular motion
and that's what this thing is doing here
what is this thing called that is a
ferris wheel
you see these at amusement parks so
let's take a look at a video of a very
big ferris wheel Ferris wheels are fun
because you can go up let's take a look
at the motion yeah look at this these
people can go up in these cars very high
and they can get a good view of what's
going on around them it could be
romantic a lot of couples go on Ferris
wheels right is right okay so anyway the
ferris wheel is going up and around it's
going in a circle the ferris wheel
travels in a circular motion it travels
in a circular motion so we've seen
before in a previous lesson how planets
right go in a circular motion around the
Sun and moons go in a circular motion
around planets we've saw that in a
previous lesson but that's a good way to
describe that a circular motion okay so
we finished with the words let's review
okay let's take a look at these words
and match them with their definitions we
just talked about them so how good is
your memory let's take a look here are
we here are our words pull motion speed
push force and gravity remember that
pull and push our types of forces right
also gravity is a type of force motion
is our whole idea that we're talking
about and speed is how fast something is
moving so let's take a look at one a
force that moves things away from you
so a force we're not talking a force
we're talking about a type of force
remember force is our big word and
inside that word we have several forces
here we have pull we have push and we
also have gravity whoops
grab it
tea so pull push gravity those are
forces right those are our forces in the
word so we're looking for either gravity
push or pull a force that moves things
away from you
we're talking about push right because
push means to move away to move move
away from you okay so that's push number
two how fast our key word here is fast
how fast something moves so when we're
talking about something that's moving
very fast or slower right we're talking
about the speed of something so the
speed how fast is it's how fast is it
moving what is the speed what is the
speed how fast is it what is the speed
so we're talking about fast we're
talking about speed number three a force
that moves things closer to you so now
you're bringing things closer not away
it moves closer to you so it's the
opposite the opposite pandeiro of push
what is that of course that is pull
you're pulling something closer to you
you pull it closer to you okay number
four a power that produces a change in a
movement so we're looking for a power
remember when we talked about motion and
things that cause a change in movement
so things might move same things might
be stopped and suddenly they're going to
move or things that are moving change
direction because of what because of a
force force will make us object move
from a stop to starting to move that
will be a force or if the object is
already moving maybe it'll change
direction right that power that makes
that change is called a force okay so
that's a force okay number five now
retirement a force a force that pulls
things to the ground pulls things to the
ground
so the ground of course is below us we
are being pulled to the ground right if
we're using our bodies as a force we're
using our muscles to stand up if we
suddenly rocked what we fall down right
that what's that force that's that's
pulling us to the ground of course it's
always pulling us to the ground
it's called gravity and gravity is is
made by the earth because the earth is
so big and it weighs so much it has a
force it's pulling us down by the way
every object every object has gravity I
have gravity I am my body has gravity
and but the thing is my body's not big
enough thank God it's not big enough to
attract things to me right so the
gravity that my body is making is very
very very small I we don't really feel
it but every object has gravity the
earth is so big and it weighs so much
that it has that a lot of gravity so
it's pulling us down it's keeping us on
the ground ok number six the act of
moving the act of moving of course is
the name of our lesson right the name of
this unit is called motion okay so the
act the action of moving if something is
moving we say it is in motion it is in
motion it is in motion that's a common
expression by the way it's a good
expression if you say it is in motion it
means that it is moving and that's of
course what we're talking about in this
lesson
oh yeah let's take a look at our chart
here we're talking about a certain type
of force right
somebody is falling in the air and we're
talking of course the force that's
making this person go to the ground is
of course gravity gravity is a force
it's a type of force what does it do it
pulls it pulls an object straight
straight down not in a zigzag right not
an occur
but straight down straight down to the
ground okay
that's important to remember right
gravity doesn't make something fall in a
zigzag pattern that's kind of silly it
falls straight down gravity keeps things
from floating off from floating off you
know if I start floating off you know
all of a sudden I become detached from
the ground and I start to float off like
flying through the air but instead of
flying what if I fly I have some
direction I know my direction but if I
float I don't have any direction I just
kind of float off I'm not in control of
my direction float off in this space
obviously we don't want to float off
into space there's no air in space
there's not a lot of warmth in space
space is a dangerous place for us so
we're happy that the earth has gravity
and it's keeping us on the ground it's
very good for us okay let's take a look
at a video by the way this guy is bungee
jumping bungee jumping
did you ever bungee jump I actually did
bungee jump a long time ago but be
careful all right it's very scary you
jump and the the strap stretches right
so you fall down and then that strap
will pull you back up to where the strap
is tied to so it's tied to something up
here so you fall down because of gravity
it will stretch out and pull you back up
in the air and then you fall back down
so there's two forces with bungee
jumping one is gravity and one is the
force that's being made by oh like a big
rubber band right that rubber band
stretches out it wants to come back so
it'll pull you back up into the air okay
let's take a look at a video this guy is
gonna go bungee jumping let's take a
look at those two forces the first force
that he's going to feel is gravity the
second force that he's going to feel is
the stretching power of the cord that he
is being attached to or that he has
attached to it let's take a look okay
you ready to go bye-bye oh my gosh I'm
very scared so he's got to get his nerve
jump and then he goes whoa
oh that's really far down there okay now
of course the cord is stretched out and
he'll jump back up not all the way
because he'll hit his head on the bridge
but he'll come up a little bit and
they'll fall down by the way this is
exactly how I did my first bungee jump
exactly the same we were under a bridge
it was over a river we jump off the
bridge and high
hopefully the court is not that long you
don't hit the water or you don't want to
do that but you go down pretty far it's
very scary it's very amazing experience
but you got to be careful of course okay
so that's bungee jumping okay now we
have an interesting exercise here don't
be confused I will explain this to you
choose where we have to choose we're
here we have a B C D E or F these are
all places right these are places they
are where each object here's one object
right this is our first object this is
our second object where each object will
fall so we'll fall remember we're
talking about gravity what did we say
about gravity before we saw that gravity
pulls things straight down not in a
zigzag not in a curve so if I had this
object here number one and I let go this
object will fall to the ground where
will it fall will it fall at a will it
fall at B C D E or F will it fall all
the way over here no of course not this
object is gonna fall straight down it's
gonna land on B right that's pretty easy
right same thing for number two if I'm
holding on to number two and I let go
where is it gonna fall will it fall over
here why would it do that remember
gravity pulls things straight down
straight down so if I let go of number
two it will fall here II of course we
know that right because it goes straight
down gravity pulls things straight down
to the earth not in a curve not in a
zigzag but straight down
okay let's go over our true/false
questions number one motion is where
something is so if something is in a
place right it's where something is
that's motion right no that's not right
that's just false why because motion
means if you have a place here right
this is our place a and you have another
place here and that we say that's B
motion is the action of moving from one
place to another so it's not where it is
right the motion is the action of moving
from one place to another it's not where
something is it's the act of moving it's
the act of motion it's the act of
changing places we're not talking about
where it is now we're talking about the
fact that it's moving the action of
moving so that's not right
number two a push or a pull to is a
force remember we talked about two main
forces of course there are three forces
we're talking about but the two forces
that we can use right with our bodies
the forces that we can make with our
bodies we can we can push something we
can pull something
those are forces a push or a pull is a
force that is true those are two forces
that we can use with our bodies I told
you before gravity you know our bodies
do generate gravity but we can't use
that and we don't really make enough
gravity to to really matter the earth
makes enough gravity to matter so a push
our Pole is a force so as gravity
gravity is also a force but that's okay
we're just talking about these two in
this situation number three a push is a
force that moves things closer to you so
if something comes closer to you is that
a push no that's not a push what do we
call that we call that a pull a pole is
a force that moves things closer to you
that's true so this sentence is false
because we have
to change it we have to change push to
pull to make it true so it's not true
it's false okay let's take a short break
here after learning these interesting
vocabulary words about motion now let's
take a look we'll take a short break and
we'll come back and look at the reading
section okay see you soon
okay welcome back let's go over the
reading section for this unit of course
in this unit we're talking about motion
so when we talk about motion we're
talking about the act of moving if a car
a person an animal or other thing is in
motion right we talked about that what
is it doing
it is moving motion of course we're
talking about the act of moving from one
place to another if it is in motion
remember we use that preposition with
motion it is in motion if another thing
is in motion it is moving from one place
to another place things move at
different speeds different speeds we
know that right so a car is faster than
a person a person is usually slower than
an animal right so these objects have
different speeds right some things are
moving very fast but some things are
moving more slowly okay thing a car
moves fast as we know a person moves
slowly if we want to go somewhere fast
if we want to increase our speed we get
in a car and we drive somewhere but if
we don't care we don't care about our
speed
it's okay we have time then we will walk
somewhere things move in different ways
now we're talking about different ways
we're talking about also different
directions so what kinds of different
directions are there well first of all
if you take the bus to school right you
move quickly from your home to school so
you're going from A to B you're moving
quickly because a bus moves at a faster
speed than a person
walks okay now we're talking about
things move in different ways we can say
a train moves straight so if you look at
the train tracks right you have the
train tracks running here right a train
moves straight down the tracks but
sometimes a train track can be curved
and then the Train changes direction
right so a train moves straight but a
train track which is this can be curved
it can be curved it can go around in a
curve okay of course we need to do that
because trains can't always go straight
they have to change directions to go
around mountains to go around rivers to
go around buildings so train tracks are
also curved what makes things move force
makes things move or stop that's
interesting too we didn't really talk
about that that much but if you think
about it something is in motion a force
has to stop that thing right so if a
train is going down the track right it's
in motion a force put it into motion a
force made that train move but now
another force has to make that train
stop moving so another force will stop
that train of course those are the
brakes the friction usually when things
stop the force that we call that makes
things stop is friction in other words
if you if you don't have friction
there's like no touching you just go
very quickly but if you have friction
and a lot of friction if these two
objects push together it stops right
that's that makes motion stop and so we
call that friction of course the brakes
on a train makes more friction between
the wheels and the track and that makes
the train stop so a force can make it
thing move it can also make it stop
important point also force can change
the speed of things right so force is a
power right if we're walking and we want
to change our speed now we're going to
push our feet
against the ground faster we're going to
use more power more of our body's energy
and we're going to increase our speed
right so now we are changing the speed
by using more force okay that
