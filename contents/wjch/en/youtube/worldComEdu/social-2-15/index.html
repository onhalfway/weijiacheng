hello everyone welcome back to American
textbook reading I'm Brian Stewart well
this is our last lesson in the book it's
lesson 15 and we're talking about this
is our world so we're zooming out right
we're looking at the world from a very
far distance and we're looking at the
world and we can see things we can see
two main things in the world we can
discover that there are continents and
oceans in the world so in this lesson
we're gonna focus on two of the big
things that concern our world that there
are continents and that there are oceans
okay well first of all we're talking
about continents and oceans let's start
with continents and the first continent
we're going to look at is America now
this is interesting
this says that America is the continent
that has the US Canada Mexico Brazil and
other countries located in it so if we
look at this landmass here we can see
that of course America Canada Mexico is
here and Brazil is down here now some
people might consider this as one
continent but usually the way I was
taught that this is actually two
continents because they kind of split
here this is North America and Central
America right North America and this
here is Central let me write that for
you central Central America North
America Central America starts at the
line between America the United States
and Mexico all these nations down here
are Central America and this of course
is South America this would be another
continent so a lot of people will split
this landmass even though it's connected
by land they split it here and they say
South America is here North American
Central America are another continent
here and when you think about it
historically that's true because South
America actually split from Africa
many many millions of years ago moved
across the Atlantic Ocean and and
collided with this other continent here
so they have they are really two
continents and we can say they are
America or some people say the Americas
right North Central and South America
are sometimes referred to as the
Americas so it's interesting the way
that you look at it but anyway some
people will say this is one continent
but usually people say it's two
different continents North America
including Central America and South
America so it depends on how you look at
it let's take a look at a video showing
this we have a video of our of our globe
all the continents in the world except
for it you just see a little bit of
Antarctica here we'll get to that later
but anyway were is oming in or zooming
in on the Americas and you can see the
two continents here right North America
here the separation is right there and
then you can see the countries the
different flags representing the
different countries now we're zooming in
on the continent of South America and we
can see Brazil which was mentioned is
right here Brazil is the biggest country
in South America and then we have of
course different countries as we go
around Earl Grey Argentina Chile Peru in
the middle Bolivia we can see now the
many different countries around here and
we can see the different flags and we
can see the very very narrow strip of
land right here where Panama is that
connects it to Central America and North
America okay so let's move on to our
next continent okay
Europe is another landmass that is all
connected together Europe is a continent
that has Great Britain right France over
here Germany Italy
that's the boot down here and other
countries located in it so we're looking
at Great Britain Great Britain of course
includes Ireland we see France Germany
and Italy we always say that Italy is
like a boot see that it's like a lady's
boot with a high heel and she's kicking
Sicily okay but this is the landmass of
Europe okay let's take a look at a video
of this now we're going to
zoom in on Europe we see the entire
world where are we going to go we're
going right here this is where Europe is
now it's interesting that some people
will say Europe is a separate continent
from Asia but as you can see it's
connected so some people count Europe as
one continent Asia as a second continent
but other people say Eurasia
is one continent so it depends on what
country our school system you're looking
at but as you can see Europe is this
landmass here so many countries and it's
very close of course this is Africa down
here which is a different continent but
look at how many countries there are in
Europe so many countries we can see
Great Britain here it includes of course
Ireland over here then we see France we
see Germany Switzerland with the famous
white cross in the red field that's
Switzerland and then of course Italy
here with the boot kicking Sicily
towards Africa it's very interesting of
course Spain and Portugal over here and
Oh Greece you know many many different
countries in Europe Russia is sometimes
considered part of Europe sometimes
considered part of Asia but Russian
culture is very close to Europe so
people might consider Russia as part of
Europe but then again it depends whether
you think Europe is one continent
separate from Asia or it's one continent
Eurasia it depends on how you look at it
ok another continent that we kind of saw
a little bit before is Africa Africa is
a really big continent it isn't it and
look at how many countries there are in
Africa Africa is a continent that has
Egypt here
South Africa way down there and many
many other countries in between and next
to it are located in it of course you
know the animation film Madagascar
that's the other nation that's connected
to Africa ok let's zoom in on Africa now
ok where is it on the map can you find
it that's right we're slowly coming into
this land mass right here I've used that
word a couple of times land
masse landmass is a large area of land
like a continent or zooming in on this
landmass right now and this of course is
Africa we can see the two countries that
we saw before we see Egypt up here South
Africa's way down here at the tip
Madagascar I mentioned that's over here
right there are many many countries in
between okay
and you know it seems yeah there are
countries here they got flags for these
countries as well too over here okay so
we can see Kenya we can see Ethiopia we
can see the Sudan we can see Libya over
here we can see Tunisia next to Egypt
there's many many different countries
here and of course Chad is up there as
well so this is the continent of Africa
it is below or south of Europe then of
course we have Asia look at how big Asia
is of course Asia is where we are now
right
Asia is so huge it's really really big a
lot of different countries here a lot of
different cultures here right and
especially a lot of different weather
climates here as well Asia is the
continent such a big continent and look
it separates itself from Asia right here
of course when you talk about Saudi
Arabia that's not Africa that's still
Asia right the continent that has Korea
Korea where's Korea of course we know
where Korea is that's right here right
Korea China the big country and kind of
in the middle of Asia India also a very
big country and other countries located
in it of course we have all of these
island chains down here are also
included in Asia Indonesia Philippines
and all mainly just Indonesian
Philippines and of course Malaysia is
part of that as well let's take a look
let's zoom in on Asia here and as we're
zooming in notice that Asia is really
cut off about here Australia that's
another continent we'll talk about that
later but this is Asia that we're
talking about here we're assuming in on
it closely
of course this area is the Middle East
this area we also call the Far East
so the Middle East is Arabia our
an Iraq countries like those are in the
Middle East the Far East is China Korea
Japan these countries here South East of
course we have Vietnam Cambodia Thailand
Malaysia those are our Southeast
countries
okay where are we right there you see
the Korean flag right there okay right
in the middle between Japan and China
okay now like I said we're gonna talk
about Australia right Australia is an
interesting continent it is a big
continent but it's the only continent
that's one nation that's one country
Australia the continent in which the
Australian nation is located it's the
only only continent where the entire
continent is one nation separate if
there's no other countries inside this
continent right and of course that's
because of history and of course because
of location Australia is so far away
from other continents that it wasn't
really civilized or developed until very
late so when it was developed the
British settlers came over and developed
a whole continent very quickly and that
is why it is just one country and of
course Australia is right down here
we're beginning to slowly zoom in on
Australia down here Australia of course
was developed mostly in the 19th century
in the 1800s
after its discovery and that in the
1700s but of course it lies right south
of Southeast Asia this is the the nation
of Indonesia up here okay Indonesia is
part of here this is a separate country
here now it's called Papua New Guinea
and this of course is Australia it's
interesting a little personal history
when I was a boy I lived right here for
four years if you can see that little
arrow that just popped up on the screen
my father's a geologist so he was with a
mining company and we lived right in the
middle of this island for four years
when I was growing up so that's very
interesting we went to Australia many
times of course in Australia this is
this country here and New Zealand is
over here New Zealand
maybe considered part of the Australian
continent but it's kind of off by itself
right it's not really a continent New
Zealand as a country it's an island out
in the ocean but Australia is basically
one nation one continent okay we also
can't forget about another continent not
many people live there there's no no
nation that's there but it's a really
big continent and many of us we don't
really think of it that often but of
course I am talking about Antarctica and
arctica Antarctica is a continent that
is the most southern part of the world
it is land although we hardly ever see
that land most the time that land is
covered by snow or ice just in a few
places we can see rocks sticking up but
it is actually land but like I said
before it's mostly covered with snow and
ice it's Antarctica nobody really lives
there there are people who are there
working as scientists and there are
different countries that have scientists
scientific buildings there most
countries of the world have scientists
who are working there but they don't
really live there you know they don't
live there with their families they
don't send their kids to school there's
no bus or subway transportation it's too
cold right they're just mostly
scientists who are studying that part of
the world
okay so let's zoom in on Antarctica Wow
we go right down to the bottom to the
southern part we just passed America
very quickly and we zoomed in on
Antarctica right away you notice these
little areas right here we saw that on
the previous map that's actually not
land that's ice permanent ice it's
always ice so it seems like land you can
walk across it but it's not land it's
water this pink or brownish place that's
the land and as you can see it's quite a
large area of land so it is also called
a continent continents are large land
masses on the earth okay so those are
the continents right we talked about
several different continents now let's
talk about the oceans because there are
two parts of
the earth of course there are land
masses or continents land and then there
is water or oceans and there are
different oceans on the earth as well
the first ocean we're going to talk
about is the Atlantic Ocean at LAN t'k
ocean
what is this ocean this ocean is between
America Europe and Africa
so remember America is not just North
America it's also Central America and
South America so that one big landmass
the ocean between it Europe in the North
Africa in the south that ocean is called
the Atlantic Ocean when Europeans came
over to America they had to cross the
Atlantic Ocean then of course there's
the Pacific Ocean the Pacific Ocean is
much bigger than the Atlantic Ocean it
takes a lot longer to sail across the
Pacific Ocean than it does the Atlantic
Ocean the Pacific Ocean is the ocean
between America and Asia
so the west coast of America the east
coast of Asia that ocean between them is
the Pacific Ocean it's the biggest ocean
on earth it's huge
really really big then we have the
Indian Ocean and of course the Indian
Ocean is next to India it's south of
India right India sticks out into India
right sticks out into the Indian Ocean
it's the ocean between Africa is over
here and Australia is over here between
those two I don't know what I'm drawing
here we have Africa and Australia and in
between we have the Indian Ocean Indian
because India sticks down into it okay
and we can see a better map than I can
draw right here of course we can see the
the the different oceans not all of the
oceans but most of the oceans we can see
here oh we see Pacific Ocean remember
this is still the same ocean the earth
of course goes around so the Pacific
Ocean is over here east of Asia and west
of America it's the same ocean the
Atlantic Ocean we can see here between
the Americas Europe and Africa this
whole area of water is the Atlantic
Ocean
and like I just said the Indian Ocean
India sticks out into it and it's
between Africa and Australia this is the
Indian Ocean
don't forget another ocean there's
another ocean up in the north and it's
called the Arctic Arctic Ocean and
that's another ocean so basically there
are four main oceans in the world
there's the Pacific Ocean the Atlantic
Ocean the Indian Ocean and the Arctic
Ocean this of course is again the
Pacific Ocean so there are four main
oceans of the world and we can see also
the continents that lie around the earth
of course we're more interested in the
continents because that's where we live
we can't live in the ocean but the ocean
actually is more there's more ocean than
land on earth okay
now let's match each word with its
definition Wow we took a trip around the
world right now we're back and now we're
taking a look at the words and matching
them to their definitions let's remember
what we learned just now and do a little
review so our words are America america
europe europe africa africa asia asia
australia australia australia Mike ok
Australia and Antarctica and arctica
okay number one the continent that is
the most southern part of the world the
most southern part of the world the
South Pole
it's very cold covered with ice nobody
lives there only scientists are living
and working there and they don't really
live there for a long time just a short
time and what do we call that continent
of course that is Antarctica very very
cold place you probably will never ever
go to Antarctica unless you become a
scientist and want to study that area
otherwise it's really really cold ok
number two the continent in which the
Australian nation is located it's of
course you know from the name but it's
the only continent in the world that is
has only one country
or one nation on it of course we're
talking about Australia it's Australia
three the continent that has Korea China
India and other countries located in it
like Japan Malaysia Thailand Saudi
Arabia Iraq Iran the continent that has
all of these countries located in it of
course we're talking about Asia
Asia's a very big continent and there
are many many countries located in Asia
for the continent that has Egypt South
Africa and other countries located in it
and of course this is a very very old
continent right it's where human beings
first started running around right this
is a very old and historic continent of
course we're talking about Africa Africa
is the continent that has Egypt South
Africa and many many other countries
located in it like Tunisia Libya Morocco
the Congo Kenya or many many different
countries located in Africa five the
continent that has the US Canada Mexico
Brazil those are the biggest countries
and many other countries located in it
and remember there's a north central and
south part of it what do we call it of
course it's America and if we talk about
north central South America you can also
say the Americas the Americas we're
talking about the Americas six the
continent that has Great Britain France
Germany Italy and other countries
located in it again a continent that has
a lot of history a lot of countries that
kind of went around the world colonized
different parts of the world and had a
couple of world wars rate Britain France
Germany Italy and other countries
located in it it's sometimes paired with
Asia
it's called Eurasia but sometimes it's
separate so you have Asia and Europe
Europe okay okay so those are our words
and we match the definitions let's move
on now to the world we live in this is
our chart
and we can see you know when you look at
the world we live in right you can look
at it very small your home right you
walk outside your home you see your
street you see the community whether you
live in a village a town a suburb or a
city right then you you look at a city
you're kind of getting a little bit
bigger then you look at the country in
which you live and then you look at the
continent and then you look at the world
so you're starting from very small and
you're wow you're zooming out so that
you get a bigger and bigger view of
where we live so we're starting out at
home then City perhaps many of you live
in a city then we can take a look at a
country then we go to continent and then
we see the world right and we just zoom
out and we see that really we're all
together aren't we
we may live in different continents
different countries different cities
different homes but all of us all live
on this world that we call earth and
earth actually is a very small planet
orbiting or moving in a very very very
big space we call the universe so as we
can see we saw the globe we expanded it
out to look at a map right and this is
the map of the earth on which we live we
can see the main continents right and we
can see the main oceans that are part of
our world
I forgot Antarctica by the way by the
way if you take a look at Antarctica on
this map don't get confused it's not
really this big so when we take the map
out like that that it looks big you like
oh my gosh Antarctica's huge but no it's
not that way
if we went back and saw it it's it's not
that big okay okay well that brings us
to our mini quiz here complete the
sentence to best describe the picture
we're talking about the earth right our
earth which is one planet floating in
space right the world our world has
seven beep and four peep so of course
the vocabulary we were talking about
continents and oceans let's of course
start with continents first do you
remember how many continents we talked
about
let's review very quickly first of all
we talked about the Americas or the
American continent
and I told you that usually people
consider this as two continents right
North America and Central America
combined and South America as another
continent so we have two here then we
have Europe here we talked about that
next right
of course some people will combine it
but in this case we're separating it so
Europe is one continent here then we
talked about Africa which is this
continent here oops don't Saudi Arabia
is not included in the African continent
that's part of of course the asian
continent over here right well let's get
down there okay and then up here so this
is Asia and then of course we talked
about Australia being interesting it's
the only continent that is its own
country how many do we have so far one
two three four five six
am I forgetting something yeah many
people usually forget about this last
continent and that's this continent way
down here in the southern part of the
world right and it's very cold down here
right it's covered with snow hole a nice
not many people are there just
scientists really so we have one two
three four five six seven the world has
seven continents right these are our
seven continents and for what for what
we call oceans right and let's just
count those real quick this of course is
the Pacific Ocean here this is the
Atlantic Ocean
that's number two let's just do this one
to the Indian Ocean is three that's one
two three
where's our fourth ocean right it's up
here you can see it actually if you look
closely it says Arctic Ocean that's four
of course it's all this ocean up here in
the North that's the cold ocean right so
if the article oil Sark we have the
Pacific Ocean the Atlantic Ocean the
Indian Ocean and the Arctic Ocean so we
have our four oceans so our sentence is
the world has seven continents and four
oceans and like I said you know some
people in different countries learn
different numbers of continents
sometimes people will combine these two
and call them the Americas or the
American continent sometimes people will
combine these two and say it's your
Asia Eurasia right it depends on what
country you're from as to how many
continents there are it depends on where
people separate the continents so that's
an interesting point right there okay
let's move on to our true/false
questions we have three sentences are
the true or are they false let's check
them out number one Brazil is located in
North America is that true remember when
we talked about the Americas I made a
distinction usually people separate
North America and Central America as a
different continent than South America
where was Brazil it was in South America
not North America so this is false we
have to change it if we changed it so it
said South America then that would be
okay Brazil is located in South America
that's fine number two the Pacific Ocean
is between Africa and Australia so the
Pacific Ocean is between Africa and
Australia that would be south of India
right is that does that sound right
that's not right right that's false the
Pacific Ocean is between Asia and
America so we would have to change this
it's between Asia and America or the
Americas North and South America of
course we could change this to the
Indian Ocean is between Africa and
Australia that would be okay or change
it to the Pacific Ocean is between Asia
and America North and South America then
it would be true but we have to change
this sentence so it's false three the
Arctic the Arctic is the most southern
part of the world the Arctic this is a
tricky sentence because the spelling is
very similar but it's false I hope you
saw that it was false it's not the
Arctic the Arctic is the most northern
part of the world right so we would have
to change that to northern remember the
Arctic Ocean is in the north the Arctic
Ocean is in the north so the Arctic is
the most northern
part of the world why is it tricky
because aunt Arctica aunt Arctica aunt
are I'm sorry Arctic it ice boat right
Antarctica yeah it's Antarctica which is
the most southern part of the world not
Arctic the Arctic is the most northern
part of the world Antarctica is the
southern part of the world
okay so Antarctica is the most southern
part of the world that would be true but
we have to change a sentence so this
sentence is false okay change it either
way
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
section don't go away we still have the
reading section to do see you in a
little
see you in a few seconds or a few
minutes see you soon
okay welcome back to the reading passage
as you can tell this lesson is kind of
simple isn't it we're just dividing the
world into continents and into oceans
and that's the main idea in fact that is
shown in the first sentence of the
reading passage the main idea there are
continents and oceans in the world that
is our first sentence that is our topic
sentence that's a very it's a general
statement but it's specific enough that
that is the subject that we are talking
about that's our topic so we said there
are continents we listed continents
first so that means we're going to talk
about the continents first and later on
we're going to talk about the oceans so
let's begin with the continents first of
all we have America America is a large
continent the US and Canada are located
in North America in North America is
usually considered a continent by itself
Brazil is located in South America which
is considered as a separate continent to
different continents some people may say
it's one continent but most people say
it's two continents Europe is a
continent with many old countries right
many old countries in fact Europe is
sometimes called the old world the
Americas are called the new world why
because many people from Europe which
has a very old and long history
moved our emigrated to the Americas
North American South America the new
world even though there were people
living there for a long long time their
history does not go back their written
history does not go back as far as the
European history does so we say that
Europe is a continent with many old
countries a very old history old cities
old buildings old cultures ok
of course Asia is like that too of
course the UK France and Germany are
located in Europe these are all
countries that are located in Europe ok
and again sometimes people will join
Europe with Asia and say that's one
continent because it's really strange to
split such a big landmass right in the
middle there's no ocean between them so
it depends on how you look at it ok then
we talk about then we're gonna start
mixing up oceans in here right the
Atlantic Ocean is between the US Europe
and Africa so we stick the ocean in
between there we talked about America we
talked about Europe now we're going to
talk about the ocean between them and we
also mentioned Africa and since we
mentioned Africa let's have a
description of Africa Africa is the
continent that has Egypt and South
Africa so these two countries are in
Africa now we see another ocean the
Indian Ocean is the ocean between Africa
and Australia so we mentioned Africa so
let's mention the ocean that's next to
it that's the Indian Ocean and on the
other side of the Indian Ocean is
Australia Australia is a continent and
it is also a country that's interesting
remember we talked about that it's a
unique feature or interesting fact about
Australia it's the only continent that
is also only one country so Australia is
a continent it is also just one country
so it's a continent and it is also a
country very interesting Asia ok that's
another continent that we're talking
about Asia is also a large continent
Asia's are really really big
Continent isn't it what countries are in
asia wallace china there's Korea and
other countries are located in Asia
China Korea Japan Malaysia Thailand the
Philippines all of these countries are
located in Asia the Pacific Ocean is
between America and Asia so if you go
east from Asia or west from America you
have to cross the Pacific Ocean
the Pacific Ocean is between America and
Asia okay let's not forget the other
continent the other continent is
Antarctica it's a cold continent
remember it's very cold you will
probably never go there I don't really
want to go there myself it's so cold the
only people who really go to Antarctica
are scientists right it's a cold
continent at the most southern part of
the world it's on the southern part the
southern part of the world it's
underneath if you look at the world in
that way it's underneath the world the
globe the Arctic Ocean
is located at the most northern part of
the world so the Arctic Ocean is on the
other side of the world then Antarctica
right Arctic is on the top Antarctica is
on the bottom Arctic is north Antarctica
is south okay let's take a look at a
video of the world in which we live we
can see Africa right away as the big
continent that catches our attention and
we see some of the oceans let's see how
it turns we see the Atlantic Ocean here
and then we see the Americas as it turns
we see the Pacific Ocean look at how big
this ocean is it's huge and then we get
to Asia right we saw Australia pass
really quick then we're back to Africa
again Asia of course is a very big
country we saw that Europe is kind of
small in comparison to Asia and Africa
right of course like I said before a lot
of people will join Europe and Asia
together as one continent because
there's really no break in the land
right it's it's one landmass but because
of culture and history people will
separate it also okay
let's go on to our reading skill our
reading skill is classifying to classify
things and we can see that this is a
very easy subject or lesson to classify
like I said before we're classifying
land and water of course
what are we classifying ocean is water
what is land down here what is land we
can see that continent is land so we're
classifying the world into two different
groups continents and oceans and then we
have examples of each over here we have
examples of continents down here we have
examples of oceans our words are
Antarctica Pacific and Atlantic this
should be pretty easy right examples of
continents North America South America
Europe Africa Australia Asia and don't
forget Antarctica we forget about
Antarctica because there's no cities or
towns down there there's no train
systems there's no airport so I mean a
big airports down there maybe small
airports but there's certainly no trains
or other types of transportation down
there maybe boats but that's around the
decide but Antarctica is not very
developed because it's so cold so
sometimes we forget about it remember we
got one two three four five six seven we
have seven continents a lot of people
especially Americans will divide the
world into seven continents American
schoolchildren are taught that there are
seven continents but in other countries
people will combine some of these like I
said Europe and Asia gets combined a lot
right sometimes some people might
combine North American South America
some people may not consider Australia
to be a continent by itself it depends
so sometimes you have people who think
there are only five continents and in
some places people think there are seven
continents and in some places people
think they're only six continents it
depends on where you went to school
right but in an America school children
are usually taught that there are seven
continents in oceans we have four
different oceans what are they the beep
ocean the Indian Ocean the
beep ocean and the Arctic Ocean of
course the two oceans were looking for
our Pacific and Atlantic and it doesn't
matter which way we put them in we could
put the Atlantic Ocean first the Indian
Ocean the Pacific Ocean and the Arctic
Ocean okay
so basically what we've done is we've
taken the reading passage and we've
classified two major groups continents
and oceans and we can see examples of
each okay that brings us to our reading
comprehension questions how well do you
remember the reading let's take a look
number one China and Korea are peope in
Asia first of all we can see something
interesting China and Korea are
countries Asia is a continent right it's
a continent so what can we say about
China and Korea China and create our
continents in Asia that doesn't make
sense because Asia is a continent China
isn't a continent Korea is not a
continent that's very silly so we can't
say that they are continents in Asia but
what we want to know about a place right
where is it we can say what we can use a
verb China and Korea are where they are
located in Asia that's correct
let's just look at see China and Korea
are oceans in Asia Korea is not an ocean
I hope not murmur well I'll be drowning
right we have to swim right China is not
an ocean China and Korea our land right
they're part of a continent called Asia
they are not oceans they are located in
Asia okay number two the US and Canada
are located where so this is very
similar number one and number two are
very similar us as a country Canada is a
country they are located that's the word
we needed for number one in what
continent what continent a South America
are us in the Canada in South America no
they're not in South America are they in
South Africa South Africa is a country
right countries cannot be located inside
other countries that doesn't make sense
so see North America well that's true
the US and Canada are located in North
America which is a continent okay let's
move on to number three Europe is a
continent with what's what does Europe
have in it a many old countries is that
true yeah that's true we talked about
that Europe is a continent with many old
countries in it because they have a very
old history a very old culture that is
survived right unfortunately the Indians
who lived in North American South
America their histories their cultures
didn't survive because of the people
from the old countries coming over to
the new countries they thought it was
new to the Indians it was old but to the
Europeans it was new country it was a
new country so they say old countries in
Europe let's look at me and see for
practice be Europe is a continent with
many countries like France and Egypt huh
Egypt is in Africa not Europe see many
oceans in it like the Pacific no Europe
doesn't have many oceans in it and
especially not the Pacific Ocean the
Pacific Ocean is huge right Europe
cannot have the Pacific Ocean inside of
it Europe would go inside the Pacific
Ocean but the Pacific Ocean would not go
inside Europe it's too big
so of course sea is incorrect and of
course be is as well okay number four
and Arctica Antarctica is the most
southern continent that's true and
another true statement about on
Antarctica
what is another true thing about
Antarctica let's look a and it is next
to the continents Europe and America so
it's next to the continents Europe and
America Europe is in the northern
hemisphere right America North America
is in the northern hemisphere so this is
not true Antarctica is not in the north
it's in the south right it's not next to
the European continent it is next to the
South American continent that's true but
not next to the European continent be
and it is a very warm continent
what have I kept saying about Antarctica
you probably never want to go there
because it's so cold it's not warm right
so that's not true
what about sea and the Arctic Ocean is a
most northern ocean ok Antarctica is a
most southern continent and the Arctic
Ocean so we switched subjects it's not
another true statement about Antarctica
it's a true statement about another
place that's fine and the Arctic Ocean
is the most northern ocean ok so we have
two subjects we're looking at Antarctica
is the most southern continent and the
Arctic Ocean another place is the most
northern ocean so that's ok you know at
first I said we were looking at two true
statements about Antarctica but if we
change the subject then that's fine we
need another true statement about that
new subject and that new subject turns
out to be the Arctic Ocean so there's
two ways to look at these types of
questions that's a good exercise right
there okay let's move on to our chart we
here we have our chart of the world of
map we have our different continents and
we have the different oceans right this
is easy we don't have to fill in the
names of the seven different continents
we just have to fill in the names of the
different oceans so what do we have
first on our chart do you remember what
is this ocean over here that is between
America and Asia and by the way these
two boxes are the same so of course we
say it's the Pacific Ocean and this is
also the Pacific Ocean we'll see that
later okay
what ocean is between America and Europe
North America and Europe South America
and Africa which ocean is between these
continents do you remember it is the
Atlantic Ocean the Atlantic Ocean okay
good then we have one more why so we
have two more oceans I'm gonna give you
another question we have the ocean down
here
this is Africa this is Australia so it's
the ocean between Africa and Australia
also south of India of course we can
find the name if we look at the country
that sticks into it it is of course the
Indian
Oshin one more of course there's a
Pacific Ocean but one more question what
do we call this ocean way up here it's
very in the northern part of the world
what ocean is that of course you should
guess the Arctic up I keep doing that
Arctic Ocean whoa oh that's an N not an
r Arctic Ocean so the Arctic Ocean is at
the very north part of the world so for
oceans right one two three we already
said that four one two three four okay
remember the Pacific Ocean goes around
right so it's the same thing
one two three four oceans seven
continents depending on your educational
system right but usually people say
there's seven continents so basically
that's what we're talking about this is
our world the world map how do we
separate or how do we classify the world
we have continents we have oceans land
and water and we can look at all these
different land masses or continents and
we can look at the big bodies of water
that are between them and this of course
is if we zoom out right from our home to
our city to our country to the world and
we can see the big world and talk about
it and in this way we can classify it
into two major areas well this brings us
to our last lesson right it's the last
lesson of the series wow we had so many
lessons together this is like our 60th
lesson together well I've really enjoyed
teaching you guys and I hope that you've
enjoyed learning from me it's been a lot
of fun going over many different things
we've learned about many different
things about science and we've learned a
lot of different things about social
studies haven't we so hopefully you will
remember these words hopefully I have
encouraged you also to look up different
things and expand your knowledge right
if we covered something here that made
you want to learn more about something
great look it up keep learning keep
looking at new books keep learning
different lectures and keep looking up
and finding out interesting things about
the world around us
I hope you
I hope that you have the best success
that you can in your lives okay take
care everybody we'll see you later
