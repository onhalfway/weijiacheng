== Rocks and Soil ==
There are many different kinds of materials in the earth. Some materials are rough and
others are smooth.Granite is a kind of hard rock. It is very strong and good to build
things. We can make buildings with granite. Sand is a material that comes from rocks.
Sand is very rough and there is a lot of it on a beach.Clay comes from soil. It is sticky
and soft, but becomes hard when it is dry. Humus is pieces of dead plants and animals.
Humus comes from the topsoil. Sand, clay,and humus are kinds of soil. Soil is the top layer of the earth. </p>

hi everybody
welcome back to American textbook
reading I'm Brian Stewart in this lesson
we are continuing with our topic of
earth science and in lesson 10 we're
going to be talking about rocks and soil
in this lesson you will discover
different kinds of rocks and soil
actually in this lesson we will talk
about five different kinds of rocks and
soil and we can see that rocks and soil
have many different types many different
shapes and many different features let's
take a look at the first type the first
type of course is sand where do you find
sand you find sand at the beach now be
careful sand doesn't normally look like
this right okay it looks like some kids
came by and they made some sand castles
so sand sand is a material that comes
from rocks did you know that right if
you go to the beach you see a lot of
sand of course it looks like this in the
background did you know that that sand
used to be part of a larger rock but
over time a long time that rock breaks
apart and it becomes sand on the coast
of the ocean or on the edge of a large
lake and of course there's lots of
different forces that break that rock
down to sand but that's what sand is
there is of course a lot of sand on the
beach enough sand to build many many
sand castles right so there's a lot of
sand there oh yeah what's another type
of rocks and soil another type is clay
where do you find clay usually you can
find clay near streams or lakes it's wet
its moist soil clay is sticky and soft
material from the earth okay it's very
soft you can change the shape very
easily you can push it into different
shapes now because it's moist when it
dries it becomes hard and in fact you
can you see what this person is doing
with the clay
here we actually have a video of this
this person is taking a piece of clay
and they're spinning it on a wheel let's
take a look at the action here you can
see the wheel is spinning around and
they're using their hands to shape that
clay then they push their thumbs in the
top like that and wow isn't that great
they're making a type of bowl or
container now they could be making a cup
they could be making a vase for a flower
there could be making some type of
container but human beings have been
making these types of containers well
this looks like a vase maybe they're
gonna put flowers inside of it but look
at that human beings have been using
clay because it's a natural material
it's easy to work it's very soft humans
have been using clay to make pottery for
a very long time for many hundreds of
years so this is clay clay is very
useful type of soil for making things
another type of rock or soil that we're
talking about here is topsoil we've
talked about this before topsoil is very
very important to us we use topsoil to
grow plants this is the soil nearest the
surface of the ground topsoil is loose
its soft it's also rich in nutrients
that plants need to grow if there's not
a lot of topsoil plants will not grow
well in the desert there is no top soil
so plants don't grow there because
there's no moisture there's no topsoil
top soil needs to be in a place where
there's lots of plants lots of animals
and lots of water too so topsoil is very
important
another type of soil look it's kind of
nectar all right and that's houmous
houmous houmous is a substance made from
dead plants and animals is Right yucky
dead plants and animals right
they will decompose they will change
their form over time in the soil houmous
is in soil but actually even though it's
yucky and kind of gross even though it's
also very
orange it's part of the cycle of life
when an animal or a plant dies their
body falls to the ground and it
dissolves it goes into the ground and
the nutrients and the minerals and all
the things that were a part of the body
will go into the surrounding ground and
other plants will be able to use that
material to grow well so in fact it's
very important
Indians American Indians used to when
they caught fish and they ate the fish
they took the rest of the fish and they
put it in the soil next to their corn
where they were they grew crops and that
helped their crops grow well and that's
houmous they were using houmous in their
soil to help their crops grow so that
they could grow plants to eat okay now
another type of soil that's much much
different or actually it's a type of
rock that's much much different is
granite granite is a really hard rock
okay very tough very strong very hard
rock this is a very hard dull colored
rock that's granite but granite has many
different colors and many different
patterns right you could have granite
usually granite is like this very dull
gray but you can also get pink granite
white granite dark brown dark red even
black granite and people will use
granite especially when they cut it into
a sheet very flat and they polish it it
looks very nice especially in people's
homes a very common use of granite is on
the countertop in the bathroom or in the
sinks for the kitchen around the sink in
the kitchen they'll use granite
countertops
okay so countertops in the home if you
use granite it's very nice counter top I
don't know you see that countertop in
your kitchen or in your bathroom
countertops they're usually made of
granite they look very nice but it is an
expensive material okay let's move on
now we have we've covered the five
different types of rocks and soil we
have two more words to look at one is a
verb
the
is to build to build something I just
told you about granite right people use
granite in their homes well you use
different materials in your homes you
build something build means to make or
to construct something people build
houses and apartments right these people
here are building what looks like a
house or it could be part of an
apartment building so to build to create
something to construct something usually
a building ruff is our other word ruff
is an adjective
when we use this word to describe at
something it is ruff
what do we mean ruff means having a
surface that is not even or smooth
remember I just told you about granite
right when people cut granite if you see
granite in the wild it's rough right you
run your hand over the surface it's
bumpy right it's it's not smooth it's
not soft it's rough well if you take the
granite and you cut it in sheets and you
polish it right then it becomes very
smooth and it becomes very even very
flat but we have to go to you know we
have to use tools to make to cut the
granite and to polish the granite
naturally granite is very rough on the
edges lots of rocks are very rough
around the edges they are not smooth
okay let's take a look at a chart here
we're looking at two types of material
in the ground we're looking at rocks
we're looking at soil
okay so different types of rocks
different types of soil
remember rocks a rock is a hard
nonliving thing both are nonliving that
comes from the earth and then we have
some more details about rocks what are
some more specific details about rocks
well all rocks are made of minerals
right rocks are made of minerals rocks
can have different shapes so they can be
round rocks they could be long tall
rocks they could be flat long rocks they
have different shapes they have
different sizes right some rocks are big
some rocks are small and they have
different colors I used granite as an
example right there are lots of
different colors you
white rocks brown rocks black rocks and
you know different colors in between red
maybe pink you have lots of different
colors in rocks some rocks are smooth
some rocks are naturally smooth
especially if water or wind has been
eroding them right we talked about
erosion in a previous lesson but if
sometimes under the stream the rock can
be very smooth if you pick up a round
rock from a stream it's very smooth on
the on the top of it but rocks can also
be rough like these rocks look like they
just broke apart so they're very rough
if you move your hand on them is very
rough so rough is opposite to smooth
rough and smooth they are opposites ok
those those are some details about rocks
let's move on to soil soil is a top
layer of the earth you can see grass is
growing here soil is this top layer
right here it's very good for the grass
and plants to grow in it is tiny pieces
of rocks so rocks when they break apart
right they come into very small pieces
and that's what they look like
ok now of course soil if you have
topsoil
that's where your plants grow and your
topsoil has a lot of course it has a lot
of minerals in it the plants need to
grow ok so two types of rocks and soil
two types of ground basically let's
review the words that we've just studied
we have our words here build granite top
soil sand clay and houmous ok houmous we
have the definitions here let's match
the definitions to the word ok first of
all we have a substance made from dead
plants and animals which is in soil dead
plants and animals yeah right it gets
kind of gross kind of slimy and wet
right but like I said before it's very
important for the a good topsoil healthy
topsoil to be able to have plants grow
in that soil what is it called remember
it's a it's a funny sounding one not
maybe not funny sounding but you
pronounce it houmous houmous and that's
houmous substance made for
dead plants and animals okay number two
the definition a material that comes
from rocks what is a material that comes
from rocks we have build that's a verb
that's not a material granite granite is
a rock it's not a material that comes
from rock it is a rock topsoil
um well topsoil comes from rocks so does
sand well let's see what we've got here
without sand we talked about sand is a
material that comes from rocks actually
topsoil could fit here but topsoil fits
another definition more closely so we're
gonna put sand here a material that
comes from rocks and sand is small
pieces of rocks that have been broken
down over a long time number three the
soil nearest the surface of the ground
which is loose and soft that is topsoil
so although you could put topsoil here -
because topsoil does come from rocks but
it's more closely number three the
definition is more closely defined -
tops off because nearest the surface of
the ground it's on the top of the ground
it's top soil
it's that soil that's on the top which
is loose and soft and good for growing
plants okay so let's continue number
four a very hard dull dull means not not
bright colored rock a very hard dull
colored rock what do we talk about
before we talked about granite right we
talked about granite is a very hard rock
you and it's a very dull colored Rock
except if you cut it and you polish it
sometimes it can be brighter but you
have to work it naturally it's dull
colored okay number five a sticky and
soft material from the earth give you a
hint people use it to make containers
like vases you can use it to make cups
you could use it to make bowls okay some
type of container it's sticky and soft
and we saw the person using it on the
wheel what was that substance do you
remember if you guessed clay you would
be correct it's clay six to make or to
construct something such as houses or
apartments
so when people are making or
constructing make and construct mean the
same thing to make or to construct these
mean the same thing it's also the same
as saying what what other verb means the
same as to make are to construct of
course it means to build especially when
we're talking about houses and
apartments or types of buildings right
we're building to build those things
okay so that's the roundup of our words
let's move on to our chart our chart
shows us where can we find rocks so
where can we find different types of
rocks and we use rocks for different
purposes we have three pictures here
they all show the different purposes for
using rocks over here we're using rocks
to build a building here we're using a
type of rock to write notes with
remember this from a previous class and
remember oh this is a type of rock used
to make statues okay let's talk about
buildings first this type of rock here
is a limestone it comes from limestone
so we can use limestone to make very
beautiful buildings as this Cathedral
this small church it's a small Cathedral
it's a very beautiful Church in the
middle of the city a limestone is more
of a traditional material it's very
expensive it's not very common it's very
it's very expensive and it's a little
difficult to move around because it's so
heavy so it's not usually used to build
houses but people a long time ago put a
lot of money and effort into building
churches in place of worship and
cathedrals like this are usually made of
limestone especially in Europe in the
Middle Ages a long time ago so limestone
is used to make buildings sometimes now
over here where we we can find a type of
rock in a pencil right you guys are
carrying pencils around in your bookbag
in your pencil cases in the very middle
of your pencils surrounded by wood is a
mineral and of course we already talked
about that right that's called graphite
and it's a very dark colored mineral but
it's very soft isn't it it's so soft
that you can push it against paper and
you can make
clines you can draw lines with graphite
and that's how we can take notes in
class and take notes on my lecture too
right okay
okay so the last one here we're talking
about a statue this is a very impressive
statue by the way this is a statue of
Abraham Lincoln it's the Lincoln
Memorial in Washington DC actually I was
there about four or five years ago it's
a very impressive very amazing statue
and you can see his famous speech on the
walls behind him the walls are also made
of rock as well this is called marble
statues are usually made out of marble
because marble although it's a hard
substance it is a little softer and it
doesn't it doesn't break it doesn't
crack very easily if a artist is making
a statue out of marble it's kind of soft
it doesn't break very easily kind of
carves out and they can make very nice
shapes with with the mark with the
marble
another thing about marble is that it
absorbs light and so when people make
statues especially of people the light
is naturally absorb like in skin and it
makes the statue look lifelike it makes
it look like a real person and that's
why marble is very commonly used in
statues let's take a look at a video of
the Lincoln Memorial and as you can see
it's very impressive here this is the
Lincoln statue of Abraham Lincoln at the
Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC you
can see the famous words that he spoke
are carved into the rock behind him okay
now if a person was in this picture
they'd only be about this big okay it's
a very very impressive very big statue
and it was very impressive experience
for me to be there if you have a chance
get to Washington DC take a look around
the mall in Washington DC on one end of
the mall the mall is a long wide area of
land at one end is the Lincoln Memorial
with a statue of Abraham Lincoln okay
let's move on now let's take a little
bit of a review test we're going to
choose the material for each picture we
have pictures of three different things
here we need to choose what material are
they made of
so our first picture is of a little doll
right now at first glance you might
think it's made of cloth or something
like that but no if you look at it
carefully it's not made of cloth it's
made of a type of substance front that
we get from the ground it's a soft and
wet substance but when we dry it when we
put it in an oven and get all the
moisture out of it it becomes very hard
now normally we use this material like I
said before to make bowls to make cops
to make vases but as you can see here we
can also use this material to make more
fun and more interesting shapes and
objects in this case they made a small
doll out of this and she's very happy
isn't she okay
so what is this made of is it made of
sand or is it made of clay you should
choose clay if this was made of sand it
would fall apart
right it would fall apart too easily
wouldn't last for a very long time but
this is made of clay right you can pick
it up it's very hard you can put it down
you move it around it won't change shape
okay number two is a picture of a
building right and it's an old style
building right traditionally style of a
building and like I said before we don't
usually use this material to make houses
but we do use this material for
important buildings like churches and in
this case this looks like a government
building so what is the material that
they used to build this building a human
or B limestone I hope that you chose
limestone I would not want to be in a
building made of human it would smell
right it's dead animals and plants look
at me horrible right and it wouldn't
stand up and fall down all around you
and get you all slimy and wet look
that's terrible okay so it's obviously
not made of human it's made of limestone
lime stones a rock very hard very strong
okay our last picture here we just
talked about this this is a pencil what
is this material that we use to draw
with on the inside of the pencil
surrounded by wood is it sand or is it
graphite well obviously it's not sand if
you had a pencil made out of sand you
just leave a little pieces of sand on
your paper you pick up all the sand
would fall off that would be crazy
right now we use graphite graphite is
the material mineral that helps us
create lines on paper and the graphite
sticks to the paper so that's graphite
okay so those are three types of
material that we can find in the ground
here we have our chew or false questions
so we need to chew if the sentence is
true we circle true if it's false circle
false number one topsoil is found deep
underground true or false
well think about the word top soil top
at the top of the soil is that deep is
that really underground that doesn't
make sense that's false right
top soil is found on the surface so top
soil is found on the surface of the
ground not deep underground it's found
on the surface okay - granite is pieces
of dead plants and animals that sound
right remember granite is hard it's a
very hard rock dead plants and animals
are our heart know dead plants and
animals are soft they're sticky they're
wet look right granite is not pieces of
dead plants and animals that is false
okay houmous is pieces of dead plants
and animals so if we wrote houmous that
would be correct but it's not that way
it says granite so it is false okay next
one number three there is a lot of sand
on a beach true or false we saw the
picture of the beach some kids were
making some sand castles that of course
is true there's lots of sand on the
beach so next time you go to the beach
play in the sand make a sandcastle or
two it won't last long the waves will
come in and wash it away cuz sand
doesn't last but it's fun to look at for
a day and fun to play around okay we're
gonna take a break now or and we're
gonna move on to the reading section
next so stick around we'll see you soon
okay welcome back everybody we're going
to go over the reading section for
lesson 10 we're going to be talking
about rocks and soil again of course
our first sentence topic sentence is
there are many kinds are there are many
different kinds of materials in the
earth so that's a good topic sentence
there are many different kinds obviously
this sentence are this passage is going
to be talking about several different
kinds very various kinds of materials in
the earth and we talked about five main
kinds right we're also going to be
talking about how to describe those so
some materials are rough that's a
description right and others are smooth
remember rough and smooth are opposites
rough and smooth are opposites pandeiro
right they're not the same they're
opposites okay so this is we start off
the passage by saying that there are
many different kinds of materials we
narrow that down a little bit more
specific by saying two types rough and
soft so we've narrowed it down a little
bit let's narrow it down some more and
to narrow it down some more we can talk
about the specific types of material
that you find in the earths remember
there's five kinds first one granite
granite is a kind of hard rock very hard
it is very strong and good to build
things that's another word that we'd
studied right to build things we saw how
we use granite sometimes granite is used
to build buildings you can use it in
your homes on countertops so granite is
very strong it's good for building
things we can make buildings with
granite and we saw some examples of
buildings right made with granite
so that's one type of material another
type is sand sand is a material that
comes from rocks like granite right when
it breaks down very small pieces right
the smaller the finer the sand and the
softer the sand right so sand is a
material that comes from rocks sand is
very rough right
well yeah sand is rough if you if you
take it you put on your skin you you you
rub that's rough but sometimes it can
feel soft if you're walking on it
barefoot if you walk along a beach so it
depends on how you use it sometimes it's
soft sometimes it's
there's a lot of it on a beach isn't
there there's a lot of sand especially a
long beach beautiful white sand remember
what I said the smaller the the pieces
of rocks the softer it is so if you see
a nice beautiful white soft Beach oh
that's beautiful it's paradise right
that would be a very nice beach
so that's sand third type of material is
clay clay comes from soil it is sticky
and soft it's it's pretty wet right when
you talk about clay you can't really see
the individual pieces of rocks because
it's too wet but it's soft and it's very
it's almost like playing with dough like
when you make cookies right it's almost
like that it's a very soft material it's
you can push it you can shape it into
many different shapes but it becomes
hard when it's dry to make it hard
people will put it into an oven right
and they'll cook it and get all the
moisture out of it and it becomes hard
and then it doesn't change shape anymore
it's fixed
right but clay is sticky and soft but
becomes hard when it's dry so we can use
it to make many different things a
fourth type of material in the ground is
houmous houmous is pieces of dead plants
and animals right so like I said yuck
dead animals dead plants are in the in
the ground that's houmous and houmous it
usually comes from the topsoil houmous
is inside the top so and that's our
fifth type of material let's take a look
at a video of topsoil and we can see
here's here's some top soil with some
houmous in it and look at how soft and
how wet and sticky that is that's really
good topsoil actually that's that would
be very good topsoil for growing plants
in and that's what farmers are looking
for of course when they want to grow
their plants their crops on their farm
they want to get houmous and mixed in
with the topsoil so that it's very good
for the plants okay sand clay and
houmous are kinds of soil so our types
of soil three types sand houmous and
clay types of soil soil is the top layer
of the earth the top layer of the earth
we can see that there this earth this
soil isn't so rich it doesn't have a lot
of houmous in it it's a little
dryer but it's still soil now let's take
a look at our reading skill our reading
skill is clap to classify we're talking
about many different types of material
in the ground okay so we're gonna
classify them we're gonna set them
across in two groups
right and we saw that there's three main
types of soil right so first of all we
have soil that's our main group right
that's our umbrella group soil is the
top beep of the earth we need to fill in
the blanks with the words our words are
Beach clay houmous and layer so soil
where do we find soil it's in the top
beach clay houmous lay a layer okay top
layer of the earth because when you look
at though the earth the ground it comes
in layers right the top layer is the
soil right underneath that you might
have rock and then underneath that you
might have some more dirt or broken up
rocks and then another layer of rock you
have different layers it's kind of like
a cake really if a cake has many layers
right it's kind of looks like that in
the ground you can see the different
layers in the ground so a top layer of
the earth is soil what is sticky and
soft but hard when it is dry sticky and
soft but hard when it's dry another clue
we can use it to make many different
things like bowls cups vases even dolls
as we saw before so what substance is
that what type of soil is that that of
course is clay so clay is our answer
there now we have the next type sand
sand is a type of soil but we need to
fill in the detail the missing detail
about sand there is a lot of it on a
what where can we find where can we find
a lot of sand think about that if you go
to the ocean you find next to the ocean
we have a beach so there is a lot of it
on a beach on the beach you can find a
lot of sand you can play in it you can
run around in it you can build sand
castles with sand our last type of soil
we have clay sand what's the other type
it is pieces of dead plants and animals
yuck yeah yep you're right of course
we're talking about
houmous houmous okay so that is a type
of these are the are three types of soil
okay let's move on to our comprehension
questions number one some materials are
rough and others are remember I pointed
this out what is the opposite pandeiro
of rough what is the opposite word from
rough if you choose topsoil no smooth
yeah that's the right one dead no the
opposite of dead is live or alive right
so the opposite of rough is smooth some
materials are rough others are smooth
work you know we're talking about
different types of materials this is a
good supporting sentence for there are
many types of soil there many kinds of
soil some are rough some are smooth or
so there are many different materials in
the ground right so some are rough some
are smooth okay let's move on to number
two where can you find a lot of sand
okay we have our choices here a on a
beach be in houmous see in animals okay
remember we just talked about this on
the previous slide right I said where
can you find a lot of sand you can run
in it playing it build sandcastles where
can you do these things we can do these
things on a beach of course in human
know we don't find sand in houmous in
animals well I hope not what was the
animal eating that they got a lot of
sand in them right that would be strange
okay so it's on a beach by the way
that's an important point let me just
point this out we say on on a beach
don't say in a beach in a beach is
underground right you dig in the beach
then you're in the beach but we've said
we run around on a beach
so the preposition we use is on a beach
just a small point there okay so where
can you find a lot of sand on a beach
you can also say by the way at at the
beach okay and in that case we're
talking about beach is a concept we're
thinking about it everybody knows Oh at
the beach so a couple of common ways to
use beach on the beach on a beach or at
the beach
okay okay let's go on number three what
is human made of what does houmous made
of remember it's kind of yuck right it's
not not very nice but you know it's an
important part of life so what is humans
made of a it is made of dead plants and
animals yeah that's right right we
talked about that a lot made a lot of
jokes about that B it is made of clay
and granite no see it is made of sand
granite and clay no human is made from
dead plants and animals okay it's
actually the one type of soil we're
talking about that comes from living
things the other types of soil we're
talking about come from nonliving things
right clay is a is a type of soil
granite is a rock when granite breaks
down yeah it becomes part of the soil
becomes part of the topsoil but it
doesn't make houmous right sand granite
and clay sand and clay are both types of
soil and again we have granite
okay so houmous is made of dead plants
and animals that's to remember that it's
made from live or things that were alive
living things okay for clay is sticky
and soft but hajiman okay so we're
looking for something opposite it's
sticky and soft yeah but hey now we're
looking for some opposite right but
becomes very strong when it is wet B
becomes softer when it is dry C becomes
hard when it is dry so we're looking for
something that's opposite here something
that is opposite from sticky and soft no
wet is kind of like when it's sticky and
becomes very strong when it's wet when
clay is wet it's soft it doesn't become
strong so that's not correct that's not
the right answer B it becomes softer
when it's dry now remember when we when
we were talking about clay we said you
can shape it while it's wet but you put
it in the oven to dry it out and it
becomes hard so it doesn't become softer
when it's dry it becomes harder when
it's dry it becomes hard and that C
becomes hard when it's dry that is our
correct answer right so clay is sticky
and soft normally but however when you
dry it out when you put it in oven then
it becomes hard
the opposite of soft so but shows
opposition okay we have our final slide
to go over as a review now we're talking
of course of two different types of
materials you'll find in the ground two
types of things you'll find in the
ground of course we have first here we
have a rock rock right because a rock is
a hard nonliving thing that comes from
the earth we're talking about rocks what
can we say about rocks what are the
details about rocks all rocks are made
of minerals rocks can have different
shapes right different shapes sizes and
different colors some rocks are smooth
some rocks are rough right on the top
these rocks are rough right but maybe
over here it's a little smoother okay
now down here what is this type remember
this is in layers of course we're
talking about soil over here
soil is the top layer of the earth we
can see the different layers this is a
good picture for layers one layer is
here we have a layer in between this
looks like rock that is bit that is
breaking up here or a compact it could
be clay down here too and then we have
some more dirt so we have different
layers of soil here soil is the top
layer of the earth it's tiny pieces of
rocks clay is sticky and soft but hard
when it's dry there is a lot of sand on
a beach that's another type of soil and
finally houmous is made of dead plants
and animals so we have our three
different types of soil here clay sand
and houmous okay well that wraps it up
for this lesson hope you've learned a
lot it's kind of interesting talking
about these different types of materials
you find in the ground we'll see you
guys next time
take care everybody</p></div>
