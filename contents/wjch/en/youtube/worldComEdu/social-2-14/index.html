Our Resources
We use trees and water every day. 
They come from nature. 
Things that come from nature that we use are called natural resources.
Trees and metal are important natural resources we use every day. Paper, furniture and houses are made from trees. 
Metal is used to make machines. 
We use oil to heat homes. 
Oil can be made into gasoline. 
People use gasoline to drive their cars. 
We should try to save natural resources. 
If we reduce our use of natural resources, they will last longer. 
Reusing our resources means there will be less trash. 
We can reuse the glass and plastic bottles that come from the supermarket. 
We can also recycle the plastic to make new products. </p>

hello everyone welcome back to American
textbook reading
I'm Brian Stewart we are on lesson 14
our resources and there are many types
of resources in this unit you will
discover what natural resources are so
of course our first word should be what
our natural resources write what our
natural resources well it's really two
parts we have to think about right
natural natural things that come from
nature if they come from nature they are
natural then we have resource a resource
is something that we use so we put these
two words together and we have natural
resource it comes from nature and we use
it so it is a natural resource and there
are many types of natural resources in
fact we have a video showing many many
different types of natural resources
that you can see here is one very very
important national natural resource and
that's oil right but we can see many
other types of natural resources too
sunlight is a natural resource we use
that as solar energy so also wind energy
we use trees for wood to get wood from
so there are many many different types
of natural resources that we get from
nature let's look at what we should do
with these things now when we talk about
natural resources we have to understand
that in some cases there are not an
infinite amount of resources that means
there's not an unlimited supply we can't
use the natural resources very greedily
we can't be greedy we have to be careful
how we use some natural resources like
water or wood or even land the air we
have to be careful how we use these
things or what we put into those
Isis we have to think about the 3 R's
the first R is reduce reduce means to
use less of something
so our first R is reduce that means
don't waste things right basically you
could say don't waste our resources
don't waste things don't waste resources
if you're not using the water the whole
time you're washing your hands right get
your hands wet turn off the water wash
your hands turn the water back on and
then rinse them don't waste water
don't waste other things reduce the
amount that you use only use what you
need don't waste the other R is reuse
reuse if we can use something again
that's better than getting a new thing
and using it because that's kind of
wasting too isn't it
reuse means to use again rhe sometimes
means again not always but sometimes it
means to do something again so use again
use again to use something again so if
you have a jar right you've used it as a
packaging for your jam or your jellies
or or something that was in the jar
maybe instead of throwing away the jar
and buying a vase use the jars of ACE
and grow a plants from it that's a good
idea
to reuse something our third R is
recycle so we had reduce reuse recycle
those are the 3 R's
that are very open that's a apostrophe
the 3 R's that are very important to
helping save our environment and making
the earth a better place for all of us
to live in concentrate on the 3 R's the
third R is recycle re in this case means
again - because you're cycling something
again you're making something new from
something old you're throwing away your
old plastic bottles in a bin they will
go back to the factory they will be
broken down and made into something new
it's kind of a cycle for making new
products so you're using it again so
remember the 3 R's reduce reuse and
recycle those things are very important
to help protect our environment and make
our world a cleaner and healthier place
to live and of course it means we will
have more natural resources to use for a
longer time we won't waste these things
ok well let's talk about what are some
types of natural resources paper is a
resource right it's a material that is
used for making books and papers of
course paper really isn't a natural
resource Wood is a natural resource but
we make paper from wood so paper of
course is a material we use it for
newspapers that's very common and we
also use it too for books now when you
think about it newspapers does seem kind
of wasteful doesn't it because we only
read the newspaper one day and then we
throw it away so it's important to reuse
or recycle newspapers when you're
through with the newspaper you can use
it for some other purpose maybe as
wrapping paper maybe as insulation in
something or maybe you want to wallpaper
a room with it that would be a nice
decoration but or you could recycle it
gather it together instead of throwing
it together with your other garbage put
it in a bin so that it's taken back to a
factory where they can make a new paper
from the old paper so that's very
important
it's very important to use paper wisely
also we have metal metal is not really a
natural resource we get it from nature
we get it from ore we melt it down and
we make metal from it metal is a hard
and shiny material found in nature the
main thing about metal is that it's hard
it's tough right so if we put something
in a metal canister its protects
whatever we have inside
that's very important it's hard and it's
shiny that's just another quality of the
metal but we use metal for many things
especially tuna cans right
soda pop cans and other cans that we
store or sell things in like coffee
ground coffee stuff like that but metal
is a very good thing that we use in
order to package food and to contain
many types of things okay another thing
is glass we can see many examples of
using glass glass is a material that is
used for making windows bottles and cups
and of course with glass glass is very
hard and it lasts for a long time we
have to be careful with it right if we
drop it it'll shatter and that's very
dangerous don't pick up that glass glass
that has just been broken can be very
very sharp so be very careful with class
but glass can last for a long time which
means if you use something you can use
it again and again and again right if
you have an old wine bottle you can
store water in it right and use it to
confer water put it in your refrigerator
it the glass makes it nice and cool it
stays cool in a glass container so you
can reuse glass of course you can also
recycle glass by the way it's
interesting fact glass most of glass is
made from sand if sand is heated up
really really hot then it makes forms
glass sometimes lightning will come down
and hit a beach or a desert where
there's just sand and it will turn the
sand from that heat you'll see pieces of
glass or it'll turn into glass on the
sand so sand the the thing in sand is
used to make glass it's very interesting
fact about glass but glass comes from a
natural resource sand okay also we have
plastic what does plastic come from how
do we make plastic well plastic is made
from oil we use oil to make plastic
plastic of course is a light and strong
material made by people
and of course plastic is very very
useful
it's easier to transport than glass
because we don't have to worry if we
drop it it won't break like glass it's
lighter than metal but it can be very
strong like metal too so plastic is a
very important invention a very
important discovery of course it is made
from oil and it's a certain type of
process that we use to make plastic but
as you can see plastic is used for so
many things from water bottles to toys
to chairs to all sorts of things that
you can find in your home in your car in
your school we use plastic for a wide
wide variety of things but again we
shouldn't waste plastic we should reuse
it we should recycle it and we should
reduce the amount of plastic that we use
okay so these are all natural resources
these are natural resources that we use
to make other things for example we have
metal of course we can find metal in the
ground in nature but we kind of modify
it a little bit we change it a little
bit to make it pure and to make certain
products from it like nails so natural
resources could be metal another
important natural resource is water if
you think about it water comes from
nature it's very important for us to
live we cannot live without water we
need water to drink we need water to
grow our crops so water is a very
important natural resource we should
keep it clean
don't waste it and if we can reuse it
recycle it air air of course is a
natural resource we use it I'm using it
right now right we all use air so air is
very important that we keep the air
clean it's a natural resource sunlight
of course we all need sunlight to be
happy and healthy if we live underground
in the dark without sunlight all the
time we get unhealthy we don't have we
aren't very happy so stop playing video
games all day long take some time go
outside and enjoy the sunlight right in
fact sunlight gives you some vitamins
through your skin it's good for you and
keeps you healthy but don't get too much
sunlight because that could be dangerous
but sunlight is another important
natural resource nowadays we also use it
for energy with solar panels another
important resource is oil I just said
before that we use oil to make plastic
and plastic is so important we use so
many things using plastic even these
tools I'm using are made from plastic so
oil of course is also the thing that we
use to make gasoline from which powers
our cars and our trains and our planes
and many boats so it's very important
for transportation and this is an oil
rig this is an oil pumping device
basically it's pumping oil and it just
you don't need to have anybody here of
course people need to come here put it
in and sometimes they come back and make
sure it's working ok and that you
maintain it but you don't have to have
anybody there it just keeps pumping
automatically 24 hours a day seven days
a week until all the oil underground is
out and of course that's a very
expensive natural resource ok and that
brings us back to our chart and our last
natural resource which is tree or trees
what do we use trees for we use trees to
make wood and as we saw before wood is
used to make paper well of course we use
wood for many other things it's very
nice to make furniture desks chairs
tables from wood we use wood to make
homes wood is a very nice material to
make things from because it gives us a
good feeling when we see it when we
touch it and when we when we use it so
it's a it's a nice natural resource it
is something that is renewed we can
plant more trees to make more wood but
we have to be careful not to cut down
all the trees at the same time right we
have to be careful about which trees we
cut and make sure we grow new trees so
that there's more wood in the future
anyway these are all natural resources
it's very important these are all very
important to our lives we have to use
them carefully remember the 3 R's
with natural resources reduce reuse and
recycle and that way we'll make sure we
have enough natural resources for a long
time in the future okay let's go to our
word matching exercise here we have our
words and we have the definitions that
we need to match them with our words are
or phrases natural resource right that's
one word natural resource natural
resource I'm sorry it's not one word but
it's two words together we don't
separate them here natural resource it's
one idea reduce reduce reuse reuse
recycle recycle those are our 3 R's 1 2
3
remember those very important paper and
metal paper and metal now let's match
these to the definitions to use
something again remember I told you
again sometimes we use our e to mean
again we're using something again reuse
so that is the answer we use we use it
again number two to use less of
something we use less of something so
we're not going to use a lot of
something we're gonna use less of
something we're not going to waste it
we're going to reduce in this case read
doesn't mean again it just means you
know reduce reduction to make something
smaller to not use as much to reduce the
amount of to make the amount of smaller
in this case three to make something new
from something old so it's like you're
repeating the cycle right you're putting
something back in the cycle of
production you're taking an old thing
putting it back to the beginning of the
cycle to make something new what are you
doing you are recycling it because
you're putting it back again into the
cycle recycle those are our 3 R's reuse
reduce recycle ok let's move on to
number 4 things that come for
nature they come from nature they come
from nature people use them there they
come from nature so they're natural
people use them so it's a resource we
say it's a natural resource so it comes
from nature it's natural if you use it
it's a resource it's a natural resource
okay five a material that is used for
making books and papers papers books and
newspapers of course our answer is
contained in the definition it is of
course paper paper newspapers write the
papers that the news is printed on of
course books use papers as well our
paper as well that's the material that
we use to make these things six a hard
and shiny material found in nature so if
you go looking around you can find this
type of material that's in found in
nature it's metal of course it's not
really always sometimes shiny like for
example if you look at iron iron isn't
shiny but it's a metal but we can change
iron we can do certain things to iron to
make it shiny turn it into steel which
is a hard and shiny material that we get
from nature but gold is a hard and shiny
material we find in nature that's metal
so a silver and copper and things like
that okay so these are our words and our
definitions let's move on to our chart a
chart is remember I talked to you about
the trees and I mentioned the trees are
an important natural resource it's one
of the last things we looked at on the
chart and I talked about we make paper
from it we make furniture from it we can
also use wood to make houses here are
four things that we use wood for in the
same idea right things from trees things
we make from trees paper right and this
isn't the paper that you write on or
that's in your notebook this is paper
that we use to clean things with so this
is paper towel right here this large one
we call that a paper towel a paper towel
because it's like a towel you guys know
what a towel is after you take a bath or
a shower you have a big piece of cloth
that you dry your body with that's a
towel well in the kitchen if you spill
milk or you spill a drink you can use a
paper towel to clean that up
okay so that would be a paper towel this
is not a paper towel that's a smaller
role where do you find it in the
bathroom next to the toilet we call that
toilet paper toilet paper and we use
that for something else right what do we
use it for we use it to clean ourselves
after we've gone to the bathroom that's
the best way to describe that but two
main types of paper that we use in our
homes to clean up messes or to make
things clean okay paper towel or toilet
paper that some types of paper of course
we can also find paper and books that's
a little bit different it's heavier it's
thicker and we can write on it we can
find paper and books and notebooks
newspapers things like that furniture a
lot of types of furniture are made from
what by the way do not say furnitures no
furniture is non-count right if there's
a desk a chair a table we call that
furniture we don't call it furnitures
unday oh right don't say that it's
furniture if you have many pieces of
furniture we still say it's furniture so
you have a desk you have a chair you
have a bed you have a couch that's all
furniture many pieces of furniture are
made with wood and you can see wood is a
very old-fashioned kind of nice warm
feeling to wood so what is a very good
material to make furniture from because
we get a nice warm feeling when we look
at the wood in the furniture and it's
very useful also fruit we get fruit from
trees we didn't talk about that before
but that's an important natural resource
it's food we use it right comes from
nature many types of fruit that we get
from trees right apple trees cherry
trees plum trees orange trees all of
these types of trees give us fruit and
of course as I mentioned before we can
build houses we
would of course there's many things we
can choose from to make houses most
common probably is concrete right that's
kind of a stone but a house made of wood
again it has a nice warm feeling right
it's like that furniture when we look at
it we feel ah this is good this is high
quality this is very nice
right we get a warm old-fashioned
feeling in a wooden house and some
houses are made entirely of wood but
they are a little bit dangerous because
wooden houses can burn you have to be
careful with fire in a wooden house okay
let's move on let's complete the
sentence to best describe the pictures
so we have many different pictures here
and we see your sentence we use beep in
many different ways
what are we using we're using water here
we're using water to continue to live
our bodies need water in order to
function to survive so we use water
there we use wood as furniture right to
make furniture and many things from wood
and we use oil to make gasoline we put
gasoline into our car it makes our car
go all of these things are found in
nature we use them so they're from
nature and we use them so we use natural
resources in many different ways ok so
we can see how these are just three
examples of the many many many ways that
we use natural resources in our lives
ok we've come to our true/false
questions number one two and three let's
Circle T for true and F for false number
one we use means to use something again
so again sometimes we say re and we have
used means to use that true yeah we use
means to use something again that is
true number two recycle means to make
something old from something new sounds
good right that is not true
that's false because think about it old
new you want to make something old you
don't want to make something old you
want to make something new if you make
it it's
new it's not old so these two words have
to be switched right we have to switch
them recycle means to make something new
from something old they're trying to
trick you they're right they just switch
those two words around but it doesn't
make sense because you can't make
something old you can make something new
from something that is old okay number
three metal is a hard and shiny material
found in nature so metal is hard and
it's shiny it's a material found in
nature for example gold and silver and
copper right it's hard to shiny we can
find it in nature that is true okay of
course some metal isn't always shiny
like for example I told you iron we need
to change iron to make steel which is a
hard and shiny metal but you know we do
find those ores in nature we find we get
those metals from the ground ok well
that wraps it up for the vocabulary
section here let's take a short break
we'll come back in a little bit and go
over the reading section together so
don't go away ok welcome back everybody
let's go over the reading passage
together now this is an interesting
organization here instead of starting
off with the main idea we start off with
an example we use trees and water every
day so we use trees and water every day
trees and water are examples of
something what we have to read on to
find out they come from nature things
that come from nature that we use are
called natural resources aha finally in
the third sentence we find our main idea
this is our main idea things that come
from nature that we use are called
natural resources this passage is about
natural resources instead of starting
off with that idea we start off with
examples of natural resources trees and
water trees and water are examples of
natural resources because they come from
nature so sometimes reading passages
will do that they'll start with an
example and build up to the main idea
and then we have our main idea
here let's continue trees and metal are
important natural resources we use every
day so it's kind of repeating itself
here alright
we saw trees we saw trees again over
here we get this a little bit of
repetition maybe not such great writing
but yeah that's that's what we've got
here maybe it would be better if we use
some other example but that's the way
that this reading passage is so but we
do have a new example here metal metal
are important natural resources that we
use every day
another example paper furniture and
houses are made from trees so when we
have trees we have more classification
or more detail about trees right from
trees we get paper from trees we get
furniture and from trees we get houses
these three oops these three things here
are made from trees okay paper furniture
houses are made from trees metal is used
to make machines so we're starting with
trees we give examples of what is made
from trees and metal we have an example
of what is made from metal lots of
different types of machines cars trains
engines are made from metal okay we have
another example here we go to we use oil
to heat homes okay so in each case we
can see what the natural resource is and
then what it's used for
here we have oil why is it used to heat
homes oil can also be made I'm just
putting also but oil can be made into
gasoline and people use gasoline to
drive their cars okay so we have a
little few sentences about oil oil is
another natural resource we use it in a
variety of ways one to heat our homes
and two to make into gasoline which in
turn is used to drive our cars we need
oil to make gasoline to put in our cars
so that we can drive we should try to
save natural resources of course we
should be careful about our use of
natural resources if
we reduce reduce the amount decrease the
amount of resources we use they will
last longer that's what I was talking
about before if we don't use as much if
we don't waste our natural resources
will last longer we will have them for a
longer time we won't waste them we won't
use them up too fast
so it's important that we are not greedy
about our use of natural resources
reusing our resources means there will
be less trash that's an important thing
too because with less trash that means
more land can be clean if we have a lot
of trash we have to put it somewhere we
have to put it in the land we don't want
to waste the land because that's in
another natural resource so reusing our
resources means there will be less trash
that's another important are also so we
can reuse the glass and plastic bottles
that come from the supermarket we can
reuse these things in other words we can
use them for other things or we can
recycle them right we can also recycle
the plastic to make new products so the
difference between reuse and recycle
reuse is something you do yourself right
if you use a glass a bottle for one
purpose well maybe you can use it for
another purpose
that's reusing if you use the glass
bottle to keep your milk in after you've
emptied all the milk out wash it use it
again as a vase to grow a plant from
that's how you can reuse recycle is when
you give it back to the factory they
melt it down and they make new glass
bottles or different types of glass
bottles from that product that's recycle
that's the main difference between reuse
and recycle okay we can also recycle the
plastic to make new products not just
plastic of course we can recycle glass
metal plastic those types of things and
paper of course as well okay our reading
skill is main detail and main idea sorry
main idea and
remember our main idea I circled that in
the reading passage it's the third
sentence things that come from nature
that we use our natural resources that's
our main idea the details that support
this idea we can find three main details
in this chart of course in the details
we have blanks we need to use these
words to fill in the blanks the words
are oil trees metal and reduce so let's
take a look paper furniture and houses
are made from what remember in the
reading passage we saw at the very very
first part of the reading passage we saw
that they were talking about two main
things they repeated one thing twice
remember what was that thing it was
trees paper furniture and houses are
made from trees we saw that example and
then we see beep is used to make
machines so we saw trees was one of
those things and then we saw another
natural resource that we mentioned that
was used to make machines remember it's
found in nature it's hard and it's shiny
of course it is metal metal is used to
make machines in our next detail we use
beep to heat homes and drive cars so
further on in the reading passage we saw
another type of natural resource that we
get from the ground we use it to heat
our homes to make our homes warm we also
use it to make it we turn it into
gasoline we put that gasoline into our
cars but gasoline is made from what
gasoline is made from oil and oil is
also used to heat our homes next we
should try to save Natural Resources
very important we can beep reuse recycle
and recycle them so we have remember
this 3 R's we have two of them here
reuse and recycle where's our third R if
we look down here we can see it very
quickly reduce so we can reduce reuse
and recycle them these are the 3 R's
right that we can do with natural
resources that's very important that we
save and we do not waste our natural
resources reduce
Jews recycle okay let's go over reading
comprehension questions our first one
here trees and beep are important
Natural Resources trees and what and
remember they're Natural Resources
things that we find in nature do we find
plastic in nature if you go out and if
you go out in a new area that's very
difficult of course where no human being
has ever been before and you dig in the
ground can you find plastic no plastic
doesn't occur naturally in nature I hope
that you know you go to a park you go to
the mountains I hope you don't find
plastic laying around because that's not
natural that somebody's trash right so
it's not natural gasoline is gasoline
natural no it's not natural oil is
natural we use oil to make gasoline but
what is natural natural is we find in
nature we find metal in nature we can
find gold we can find copper silver
those types of metals we can find in
nature they are important Nach Natural
Resources ok number two we can reuse
beep bottles ok we can reuse what kind
of bottles we can reuse paper and
gasoline bottles have you ever seen a
paper a paper bottle a paper bother you
pour something in it just it doesn't
hold it a gasoline bottle that's crazy
gasoline is not a bottle it's a liquid
right it cannot hold itself right so
that's very silly be we can reuse metal
and oil bottles oil is a liquid - that
doesn't make sense we can't make bottles
out of oil glass and plastic bottles oh
that's the most common type of bottles
right bottles are made from glass
bottles are also made from plastic we
talked about that glass bottles are nice
they're heavy a little bit heavier and
they keep things colder if we want to
refrigerate them plastic isn't so good
for refrigeration but plastic doesn't
break so glass and plastic are very
common for materials we use to make
bottles with so it's see we can reuse
glass and plastic bottles and yes we can
we use them we can use them again and
again okay number three what is gasoline
made from gasoline is made from
something we know that we talked about
that several times what is it used for
so we're looking for two things in the
answer we're looking for two true things
in the answer not just one true thing
but two two things a it is made from oil
that's true it is used in cars that's
true so a is our correct answer let's
look at me and see it is made from paper
no that's not true and it is used in
books no gasoline is not used in books
to not put gasoline in your books it
will smell it's not good for your skin
and if somebody is smoking nearby it
will catch on fire okay some very
dangerous don't do that okay so be is
obviously not right it is made from
metal no gasoline is not made from metal
and is used in furniture no gasoline is
not used in furniture so that's
incorrect okay a is the correct answer
gasoline is made from oil and it is used
in cars true and true okay that's a
number four if we reduce reuse and
recycle if we use the 3 R's if we
practice the 3 R's reduce reuse recycle
what will happen what's the result a we
will use more natural resources we'll
use more of them no that's the whole
that's missing the point that's the
opposite of we want what we want we want
to use less natural resources if we do
these three things so that's not true be
our natural resources will last longer
so if we use less natural resources
obviously there will be more natural
resources that we can use later so our
natural resources will last longer that
is true see for practice we will not be
able to drive our cars you can reduce
reuse and recycle and still drive your
car that doesn't make sense that is not
the correct answer so in this case B is
the correct answer if we reduce we
recycle we reuse our natural resources
will last a longer time we'll have more
Natural Resources for a longer time in
the future and that's very important
obviously we don't want to waste our
natural resources we don't want to run
out of our natural resources okay let's
take a look at our chart that we looked
at before right we have natural
resources what are they what are these
these are hard shiny this is hard shiny
material we can use it to make nails
what material is this of course it is
metal
we need this resource every day for
drinking you should drink several
glasses of this every day it's very
important for our bodies it's also
important to grow plants and crops our
food and it's important that we keep it
clean we find it in lakes and rivers
what is it it is water over here of
course you can't really see it right
it's invisible
but we breathe it every day and when it
moves as wind it blows the seeds of
certain plants around and of course we
call that air it's air we use it all the
time unless you're holding your breath
then you're not using it but you have to
use it eventually you can't hold your
breath forever
don't try ok but you can't hold your
breath forever we need air to live ok
the next one we get this from the Sun
right
it makes our days very light and bright
ok of course it is Sun light ok over
here we talked about this a little bit
we saw a video of the machine the oil
pump that is pumping oil out from the
ground right I just said what it is it's
oil oil is used of course to make
plastic it's also used to make gasoline
that we put in our cars and we drive
it's also used to heat our homes and
finally here we have this nice beautiful
thing that we find in nature if you see
many of them together we call it a
forest of course we're talking about a
tree and trees are used to make wood
right wood is in the trunk of the tree
and we use wood to make furniture to
make homes we use it to make paper and
we
use it to make toys and all sorts of
other things so wood is very useful
natural resource so we were talking
about 14 less than 14 our resources as
you can see there are many types of
natural resources there are more than
just on this chart but there are many
natural resources that are shown in this
chart and remember when we talk about
natural resources these are things that
come from nature that we use but it's
very important how we use these things
remember there's not an unlimited supply
of trees or oil or actually metal and we
have to be careful about how we use
water air no not really sunlight
sunlight it's always going to be there
but air and water we have to be careful
about how we use these things remember
reuse recycle reduce the 3 R's are very
important in saving our natural
resources
so what so they will last longer we will
have them around for a much longer time
imagine if we ran out of these things if
we didn't have these things anymore our
lives would be horrible terrible we need
these things we need them to last a long
long time so reduce reuse recycle though
it's very important ok well I hope
you've learned a lot in this lesson
we'll see you again next time take care
