<p>Light is a kind of energy. 
Light comes from the sun. 
Light also comes from flashlights, candles and streetlights. 
Light is importantb ecause it lets us see things. 
Light can pass through clear objects.
Light passes through clear glass or clear plastic. 
But light cannot pass through objects which are not clear. 
Sunglasses will block some light and protect your eyes. 
When you shine a flashlight on a toy, a dark shape of the toy will be formed.
It is called a shadow. 
A shadow is made when an object blocks light. 
You can see many shadows on a sunny day. </p>

hello kids how are you doing welcome
back to American textbook reading I'm
Brian Stewart
we're on unit 11 right now and we're
going to talk about light so in this
unit you will discover what light is
what is light and how a shadow how a
shadow is made so we're talking about
light and shadow in this unit first of
all let's talk about light what is light
light is the energy we're talking a lot
about energy in this book aren't we
there are many different types of energy
light is the energy that makes it
possible to see things so remember
energy is something that causes change
right so energy if we see with this
energy it allows us to see things if we
don't have light right there's no light
we can't see things so light is energy
that hit something bounces back and we
can see it with our senses so light is
energy that makes it possible to see
things without light we cannot see we
need light to see okay dark is the
opposite of light it's the opposite
light pandeiro dark right dark dark
means with no lights no light or very
little light sure there's some light but
it's very little light so it's dark in
this alleyway there's light sure we can
see but there's very little light so
it's dark we say it's dark
also of course if there's no light at
all everything's black that's of course
dark as well so dark just doesn't mean
just no light it can also mean little
light okay so a couple of things sure
there might be a little bit of light but
it's still dark out so we have to really
look carefully to be able to see things
so light and dark okay next we have
shadow what is a shadow we can see a
good picture here right this is the
shadow of the boy right here so a shadow
is the dark place this is dark this is
light the shadow is the dark place here
made when an object this boy is an
object blocks light so he's blocking the
light the light is coming in this
direction it hits the boy and it stays
on his head it doesn't go through his
head it stays on its head his head is
blocking it so it's blocking the light
other light over here it can go all the
way down it hits the ground and that's
light the light is not blocked there's
nothing blocking the light here there's
a boy
blocking the light he causes a shadow he
makes a shadow and this of course is his
shadow so when something blocks light it
creates a shadow a good word in English
we say it casts he casts a shadow he
casts a shadow to cast a shadow that's
what he's doing because he blocks the
light okay at night it's very dark the
Sun is gone there's no Sun so we need
light to see by many cities will put
streetlights in their cities streetlight
of course is two words street this is a
street and of course light this is a
light so this is a street light street
lights are lamps on the street very easy
right street and light they are lamps
here that are on the street that allow
us to see the city streets at night this
is a street where people are walking but
many streets in the cities are places
where people drive it's dangerous to
drive if you can't see if there's no
light so cities will put lamps on the
side of the streets so
drivers and people who are walking can
see and be safe
so street lights make cities safe they
are lamps on the streets next we have
this word here pass pass in this case is
a verb this is an interesting picture
pass means to go through so what's going
on here we have our light light is
coming in this direction this is light
it hits this prism by the way this is a
prism prism what happens is the light is
passing through but it's very
interesting what happens to light when
it passes through a prism the light will
hit here it will change direction and
this prism will separate the light into
many different colors so sure the light
is passing through to go through it's
going through this piece of glass it's
going through but when it passes through
the glass the glass is different from
air it's denser it separates the light
and that's what happens it passes
through on the other side it comes out
and you can see all the different colors
that light is made up of so it's very
fascinating right it's passing through
sure but it's being split up if we look
at a window light passes through a
window but it's not being separated by
the the angle of this glass it's it's
just going straight through so light
passes through a window very easily
because a window is transparent so to
pastor just means to go through light
passes through some things light doesn't
pass through all things okay
sunglasses here we have another two-part
word Sun is our first word glasses is
the other word I'm wearing glasses are
these sunglasses no they aren't
sunglasses are dark glasses my glasses
are not dark
these glasses are dark these are
sunglasses that protect your eyes from
the Sun people wear sunglasses when
they're outside and sure when I go out
side I changed my glasses to sunglasses
because you want to protect your eyes
from the Sun be careful the Sun can be
dangerous to your eyes don't look at the
Sun right even if you have sunglasses
don't look at the Sun but if you're
outside it's a very bright day there's a
lot of sunlight out you might want to
wear dark sunglasses or just sunglasses
because they protect they protect your
eyes from the Sun which is important
look out after your eyes be careful with
your eyes okay where can we get light
well one place we can get light is from
a candle and this is a good picture of a
candle a candle is something it's an
object that is burned burn this flame is
burning the candle right for light we
burn the candle because we want to have
light if we want more light we burn more
candles okay light will be coming from
the candle also sometimes candles smell
good but our main purpose is for light
we burn candles for light so if the
electricity in your house goes out and
you don't have a flashlight you can
light a candle to look around but be
careful because it's burning that's fire
be careful with that Joe some hail it's
safer of course to use a flashlight a
flashlight is the same idea as a candle
we use it for light but it's a small
lamp that uses batteries it uses
electricity electricity is in the
batteries and we turn it on or off to
get light so a flashlight is safer than
a candle by the way just so you know in
United Kingdom in England they don't say
a flashlight they call this a torch
which is interesting and that's in the
UK in the United Kingdom people from the
United Kingdom will call it a torch so
if you go to England or Ireland or
Scotland don't call it a flash
tonight they may not know what you mean
you can call it a torch instead they'd
understand that but if you go to America
don't say you want a torch because it
torches a piece of wood that burns right
in America in the United Kingdom a torch
is this in America say it's a flashlight
okay here we have a good chart we have
different light sources we have the Sun
which is a very important light source
that's our main light source during the
day when we go outside it's very bright
because of the Sun so it's a very
important light source also at night
time when the Sun Goes Away right we
still need light so then we can use
light bulbs a light bulb this is a light
bulb it gives off light and of course we
use that inside our homes inside our
classrooms also very important at night
we turn on the lights
to give ourselves light over here light
sources stars stars give off light right
we can see a lot of light in the night
sky we can see many points of light
those are stars it's not a lot of light
I mean it's probably not enough light to
read by obviously not enough light to
read read by may be enough light to walk
around by maybe but the star light is
very very weak it's not a lot of light
of course it's a lot of light in the sky
but not a lot of light on the ground
okay and finally we have street lights
street lights use light bulbs of course
to light up the streets at night to make
the streets safe for walking around for
moving around for doing things so you
can see at night let's do the exercise
to match our vocabulary with definitions
okay we've just learned a lot of good
words a lot of interesting words let's
match these words with the proper
definition our words are shadow
sunglasses light dark pass and street
lights let's match them first we have
the dark place made
when an object blocks light so we have
an object that is blocking the light the
light is coming this is my object the
light is coming this way
right and then we have a dark place down
here where the light is being blocked
it's a very strange picture I'm not a
good artist okay
but this is our object this is a what is
this called
this of course is the shadow this is the
shadow that is cast when an object
blocks the light a dark place made when
an object blocks light number two with
no or very little light with no light or
very little light when we have no light
or very little light we say that it is
what it is dark outside it's dark
outside bring a candle or better yet
bring a flashlight okay then you can see
you can bring your own light number
three to go through so you go through
something light goes through a window
light passes through a window to pass
means to go through something to pass
you go through it number four a lamp on
the street especially cities will put
these on the streets to give light at
night so remember it's on the street and
it gives light what is it called its
called a street light because these are
lamps out on the street they give us
light we call them street lights next is
number five dark glasses not these
glasses these glasses are not dark
glasses but dark glasses that protect
your eyes from the Sun so you might want
to wear these if you go out on a bright
day what are these called their glasses
right
protect your eyes from the Sun so we put
this word and this word together what do
we have sun glasses they're sunglasses
they protect their glasses you wear to
protect your eyes from the Sun number
six the energy energy it's a type of
energy that makes it possible to see
things so you can see things
what do we call that we call that light
of course of during the day we get a lot
of energy light from the Sun and that
allows us to see at the daytime at night
we need to use street lights or a torch
or a candle or a flashlight to be able
to see at night here we have our chart
light and shadow opposites opposites
light and shadow light is the opposite
of shadow shadow is the opposite of
light if we talk about light here light
can pass through clear objects if this
is a clear object the light can pass
through of course in this case the light
is getting broken up but usually light
can pass through like a window it can
pass through glasses of course light can
pass through glasses if light couldn't
pass through these glasses I wouldn't be
able to see anything right they would be
black I couldn't see anything so light
can pass through clear objects it cannot
pass through objects that are not clear
so my glasses are clear but my head is
not clear okay light can pass through my
glasses but light cannot pass through my
head let's take a look at a video here
showing light passing through this
triangle prism look at the light goes
down it hits the prism and it goes out
now of course this is a special case
this is not normally like a window of
your house or a window on your car or
the glasses in your glasses the glass in
your glasses this is a special case the
light is coming down and it's getting
bent by the angle of the glass here and
it's getting split all these different
colors show us what this light is made
of this light is actually getting
separated by this prism and it shows
many different colors by the way some
people will have these types of glass or
crystal objects hanging from their porch
and during the daytime the sunlight
comes down and it makes beautiful colors
on the walls because the light goes
through and it makes all these different
colors on the walls of their Patti
or outside their house and very
beautiful okay now we're gonna talk
about shadow we see here an airplane can
light pass through the airplane no it's
a solid object right well of course the
glass on the canopy light can pass
through that right light can pass
through clear objects like glass but the
airplane the metal on the airplane is
not clear light cannot pass through that
so what happens it makes a shadow on the
ground so a shadow is the dark place
this dark place made when an object
blocks light so light is coming down
this object is blocking the light so we
see the dark place on the ground right
where light cannot pass through let's
take a look at a picture here video we
can see that's not the airplane right
that is the shadow of the airplane
whoever is taking the picture the video
is in the airplane looking down at the
ground and the airplane is passing over
the city of course it's in the air if
that airplane was real obviously it
would happen it would crash by now okay
so now here the airplane is coming in
for a landing it's coming closer it's
coming closer but we can see very easily
the outline of the airplane because the
light cannot pass through that airplane
and boom we're on the ground right now
it's all dark because we're very close
and of course now we can see the actual
wing of the airplane right the light is
on the top of the wing but it is not on
the ground it's blocking the light and
same thing here the light is on the
other side but here we have shadow where
the light cannot pass through the the
the object of the wing of the airplane
it can't pass through there so we have
shadow okay
let's choose the correct word so we have
two pictures here okay and we're talking
about clear objects or solid objects
right or objects that are not clear
sunlight will or will not so we have to
choose between will or will not pass
through the plastic toy here
we have a plastic toy will the sunlight
pass through this object we can see very
easily
is there a shadow or not you can see the
shadow on the backside there you can
also see the shadow here that means that
sunlight is not passing through the
sunlight is being blocked so we have to
choose will not sunlight will not pass
through the plastic because we see that
there's a shadow here of course it's not
clear either sunlight will not pass
through an object that is not clear
these plastic toys are not clear
sunlight can't pass through those how
about this number two sunlight will or
will not pass through the water well if
you look at the water right here's the
clear water here and we can see the
bottom of the pool on the bottom so
basically if we look at this sunlight
will pass through the water water is
clear we can see through the water light
will pass through it but we have an
interesting thing here we have a boy the
boy is body is not clear light will not
pass through so we can see the shadow
woops we can see the shadow right here
we can see the shadow of the boy because
the boy is not a clear object he's
blocking the light also the side of the
pool the cement is also not clear so the
light cannot pass through and we see the
shadow of the side of the pool right
here so sunlight will pass through water
because water is clear but sunlight will
not pass through human's bodies or the
concrete on the side of the pool only
sunlight can go through clear objects
like water or glass okay let's take a
look at our true/false questions number
one there is a lot of light in dark
places a lot of many right a lot of but
we can't use many here because light is
non-count we have to use a lot of a lot
of light in dark places does that sound
right if it's dark there's a lot of
light of course that doesn't sound right
right it's false because in a dark place
there's not a lot of light
there is no
light or very little light in dark
places there is no light or very little
light whoops
little light in dark places so we have
to change the sentence that sentence is
false
number two light makes it possible for
us to see things is that true if we
don't have light we can't see things
light is the energy that allows us to
see things that is true there's no
problem with that sentence that's
absolutely true because without light we
can't see things light makes it possible
light makes it allows us to see things
so it makes it possible to see those
things number three a shadow is made
when light passes through an object so
if we have an object here right and
light can pass through it is there a
shadow oh there's no shadow because
light can pass right through it so a
shadow is made when light passes through
an object that's not true a shadow is
made when light cannot pass through an
object a shadow is made when light
cannot pass through an object we have to
change the sentence to make it true so
of course this sentence is false okay
well let's take a break right there
we'll come back in just a bit and we'll
take a look at the reading section for
this unit okay so welcome back we're
going to go over the reading section for
unit 11 and of course our topic is light
so the reading passage will give us a
lot of details about light and what it
is first of all we can see that light is
a kind of a kind of energy light is
energy it's a type of energy there are
many kinds of energy light is one of
those kinds of energy where does light
come from it comes from
the Sun light comes from the Sun that's
one place that light comes from of
course that's the most common place that
light comes from during the day we have
a lot of light because of the Sun but
light also also comes from flashlights
candles and streetlights so light
doesn't just come from the Sun it also
comes from flashlights candles and
streetlights light is important
obviously because it lets us
it lets us it allows us it makes it
possible to see things lights important
because it lets us if you say it lets us
do something it's like saying it allows
us to do something or it makes it
possible for us to do something it lets
us see things so like we need light to
be able to see things especially in the
city at night we need light to be able
to see where we're going we need to be
able to see what we're writing we need
to be able to see other people light
allows us lets us to do those things
now light can pass through clear objects
like my glasses the glass and my glasses
light can pass through them very easily
they're very clear these are clear
objects clear means I can see through
them light glass passes through clear
glass or clear plastic plastic can be
clear to you know if the the plastic has
no colour you can see through it it is
clear so clear glass or clear plastic
light can pass through these things but
light cannot pass through objects which
are not clear there are many objects
that are not clear this pen is not clear
I can't see through it sure it's made of
plastic but it's not clear plastic right
my hand is not clear I cannot do that
would be horrible right I could see
through my hand I could see all the
veins maybe in the bones
weird but thankfully my hand is not
clear right I can't see through it it's
not clear light can't pass through my
hand now sunglasses will block some
light right sunglasses are an
interesting case
sunglasses are dark glasses they aren't
clear you can see through them but
they're not completely clear they're not
as clear as regular glasses so
sunglasses because they're not as clear
they block some light and this protects
your eyes of course you don't want to
block all the light you know your
sunglasses are completely black and you
can't see anything
that would be dangerous you'd run into
things right so sunglasses block some
lights not all light but some light but
the reason for that is that they protect
your eyes by reducing the amount of
light hitting your eyes you're
protecting your eyes your eyes don't
need a lot of light they need some light
but not too much light too much light is
bad for your eyes so the very bright day
it's important to wear sunglasses to
protect your eyes when you shine China
is a good word shine is to put light on
something you shine light on something
when you shine a flashlight on a toy
right so let's say you have a toy you
shine a flashlight on a toy what happens
a dark shape of the toy will be formed
behind the toy so my flashlight is here
the toy is here behind the toy there
will be a dark shape it will look like
the shape of the toy but it's obviously
not the toy but it look like a shape of
the toy on the ground behind the toy
that of course is called a shadow a
shadow is made when an object blocks
light so the light can't pass through it
blocks it says you can't pass I'm
blocking you so though the object blocks
the light light
cannot pass it is blocked you can see
many shadows of course on a sunny day on
a sunny day
there's a lot of light the light is very
bright and that makes the shadows even
darker let's take a look here is a sunny
day we can see a shadow here and a
shadow here these of course the shadows
are moving they're alive no they're not
alive there's shadows of people people
are alive but they're casting shadows on
the ground from the sunlight so the Sun
is way up over here the people are here
we can't see the people but we can see
their shadows on the ground because
they're blocking the sunlight ok we've
come to our reading skill chart and our
reading skill is organized by main idea
and details our main idea here is right
here light is a kind of energy so that's
our main idea and we have details to
support this main idea what is light
made out of what does like do what is
what affects light ok so these are our
details we have four main details we
have five blanks these are the words we
need to use to fill in the blanks our
words are sunglasses see shadow blocks
and passes over here in our first detail
we see where light comes from light
comes from the Sun flashlights candles
etc etc etc' is etc it means that there
are other examples that are too long we
don't have time or space to list them
but there are many other examples so
some examples Sun flashlights candles
and many others etc etc light lets us do
what lets us it allows us it makes it
possible to do what which of these vert
of which of these words down here is a
verb of course see blocks and passes are
all verbs but we need one of them light
lets us see that would be correct
not blocks or passes but light allows us
to see if we don't have light
we can't see so light allows us lets us
see let's move on like beep through
clear objects if an object is clear we
can see through it what does light do
well light passes through clear objects
light can pass through a clear object
light passes through clear objects like
glass or plastic air water now something
will block some light and protect your
eyes if you want to protect your eyes
you want to be careful with your eyes
especially when you're outside and
there's a lot of light you can put
something on your head that will block
some light not all the light but some
light they will help protect your eyes
of course what kind of glasses are those
those are sunglasses a special kind of
glasses that allow you to protect your
eyes these are not sunglasses these are
regular glasses but if I go outside I
will put on sunglasses to protect my
eyes finally over here we have a beep is
made when an object beep light ok we
have two words left right shadow and
blocks so which one goes into these this
these blanks what is made well a shadow
is a noun so a shadow is made when an
object verb blocks light so if an object
blocks light the light can't pass
through the object what is made on the
other side of the object that would be a
shadow shadow is a dark place made when
an object blocks light so this is our
chart we see our main ideas light is a
kind of energy and we can see some
details about lights ok let's move on to
the reading comprehension questions we
have the different questions here how
well do you remember what you read let's
look at number one what kinds of objects
can light pass through so what kinds of
objects what types of objects
can light pass-through can light pass
through metal objects no usually metal
there's no type of metal that light can
pass you can you think of any metal that
light can pass through there's no type
of metal that light can pass through
what about people can light pass through
people can light pass through my body my
hand no light cannot pass through people
people cast shadows what about sea glass
ah glass sure light can pass through
glass right even if it's dark glass
light can pass through it some light can
pass through it so of course our answer
is C light can pass through glass number
two light can come from things like
remember we talked about different
sources of light there are many
different sources of light where can
light come from light can come from many
things like for example a shadows and
the Sun can light come from shadows no
light doesn't come from shadows a shadow
is the result of light being blocked
right so that's not true
sure it comes from the Sun but not from
shadows so a is not the correct answer
light can come from things like candles
and street lights can light come from
candles sure we burn candles to make
light can light come from street lights
sure people in the city they put up
street lights so they can see at night
so B is the correct answer
what about C light can come from things
like sunglasses do sunglasses make light
does light come from sunglasses no
sunglasses block some of the light so
that it protects your eyes so that's not
true
what about toys toys don't make lights
right toys are usually made of plastic
objects light doesn't come from plastic
right so this is not correct obviously
our correct answer here is B
let's move on to number three sunglasses
will protect your eyes by how do
sunglasses protect your eyes what do
sunglasses do in order to protect your
eyes let's take a look
sunglasses let all the light from the
Sun pass through it let all the light is
that true no because then my glasses
would be sunglasses my glasses let all
the light from the Sun pass through and
these are not sunglasses so this is not
true sunglasses will protect your eyes
by blocking some of the light from the
Sun so not all but some and that's true
isn't it right so be is our correct
answer
sunglasses block some of the light not
all of the light because if we block all
of the light then we can't see right but
again sunglasses don't let all of the
light it blocks some of the light it
lets some of the light through number
see blocking all of the light from the
Sun obviously if it blocked all the
light from the Sun you would not be able
to see you would walk into other people
and you would walk into walls you don't
want to do that so obviously that's not
right B is our correct answer there for
if you shine a flashlight on an object
what happens a you can see a dark shape
of the object behind the object of
course you can't and that's of course
the shadow the shadow is what you can
see that is the dark shape so if you
shine a flashlight on an object you can
see a shadow a dark shape of the object
behind the object a is the correct
answer let's look at B and C for
practice B the object will become clear
that would be strange right if I shown
if I shined a flashlight on this object
does it suddenly turn into a clear
object no it's still an object that is
not clear so B that's not true see a
shadow shaped like the flashlight is
formed so if I shine a light on
example a ball do I see a flashlight
shaped shadow behind it no I see a ball
shaped shadow behind it so see is not
correct the right answer is if you shine
a flashlight on an object you can see a
dark shape of the same object that
you're shining the flashlight on that's
of course is a shadow a is the correct
answer okay now we've come to our chart
our chart is showing us different light
sources what are some different light
sources here we have a very common light
source perhaps the most powerful light
source we know of that's been around for
a very very very long time what do we
call this object that gives us light
during the daytime we call it the Sun
okay so that is the object that gives us
light during the day it's called the Sun
at night when the Sun Goes Down we have
no more light so we have to use our our
brains we had to invent something right
Thomas Edison had to invent something to
allow us to see at night and what he
invented was the light bulb so the light
bulb allows us to see at night it is a
light source down here at night we can
see many different points of light in
the sky now this is at night time the
Sun is gone so these little points of
light we can see them maybe it's enough
light to be able to walk around by but
it's not enough light to read by what do
we call these light sources these are
called stars but they're so far away
that they don't give us a lot of light
we can see them but we're not getting a
lot of light from them finally over here
at in the city at night we can see on
the side of the street people will put
up lamps and we call those street lights
street lights are as a light source at
night especially in the city it makes
our cities safe so we can move around we
can get around we can see where we are
going okay so that wraps it up our unit
of course we were talking about light we
talked about what light
we talked about how shadows are formed
from the absence of light or light can't
pass through things and we also saw many
different sources of light where we get
light from okay well I hope you've
learned a lot as usual and we'll see you
guys next time take care everybody</p></div>
