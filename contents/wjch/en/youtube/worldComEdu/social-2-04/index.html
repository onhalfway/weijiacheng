hello everybody welcome back to American
textbook reading were on lesson four and
by the way I'm Brian Stewart but anyway
we're on lesson for lesson for the
United States government we're talking
about the government of the United
States in this unit you will discover
the government offers government
services to communities so when we think
about the government we say why do we
need a government what does the
government do well the government is
very important because it offers
services to communities the government
gives us services things that we need we
need some work that people will do for
us who will do those things for us
private companies don't do those things
for us or maybe we can't trust the
private companies the government will
give us those services that's what we're
going to talk about in this unit so
let's take a look our first word of
course is government what is government
government is defined as the group of
people that controls a community now
that's an interesting where it controls
a community it's a group of people that
has the power to make laws to change
community policy but be carefully using
control right in democratic countries
the government sure they kind of control
the community but the people elect those
leaders so they don't have absolute
power in other countries that are not
democratic yeah one person or a few
people do control the community so it
depends on what kind of government we're
talking about but it's a government it's
a group of people who are in charge who
who figure out how the community will
act what will happen in the community
what the laws are so that's the group of
people that controls a community in the
United States the government is
represented by the Capitol building also
by the White House but the Capitol
building is where Congress meets and
then of course is a very large group of
people who are elected to their position
elected to their office and they make
laws that everybody in America must
follow so that's the Capitol building in
Washington DC where Congress meets ok so
we talked about government government
offers services to the community but
what is a government service what are we
talking about a government service is a
thing that government does for a
community your thing isn't something
that you touch or hold it's a service
it's work so you could say work that a
government does for a community here are
two examples of work that a government
provides for a community first of all we
can see a police officer what does a
police officer do they work to keep us
safe to protect us from bad people
obviously police officers are very
important they offer a valuable service
to the community
the other example that we can see here
is of a firefighter what do firefighters
do they also keep us safe if there's a
fire or emergency firefighters come out
and help people get to safety or they
help put out fires
they help deal with disasters and of
course this is in a very important
service to the community especially in
times of emergency so these are two
examples of work or things that a
government does for a community these
people are part of the government they
work for the government they are part of
the government so government services
are work that other people do
to make our lives much better okay most
countries and especially America has a
president the president is the leader of
a country so usually we have one person
who is in charge of who controls the
country or who represents the interests
of the majority people of the country
and we call that person a president in
this picture of course we can see US
President Barack Obama and his wife
Michelle now here we can see Barack
Obama he's giving a speech presidents
give a speech they always have this seal
here
this symbol anytime they give a speech
they have this seal here at their podium
and of course presidents give speeches
many people come to hear what the
president has to say in this case the
president is talking about health care
he wants to provide the American people
with another government service in terms
of health care and he wants people to
vote for his plan he wants people to
support his plan so he comes to the
people and he talks about his plan or
plans and the people say yes we like
that we will do that so that's what the
President of the United States does most
of the time he's giving speeches trying
to convince people to support his ideas
and what he wants to do to give the
nation certain services or to do certain
things okay when we talk about the
government the government has to meet
somewhere right these are people you
know you have the president you have
Congress many people are involved in the
government they have to meet somewhere
they have to have their offices
somewhere in America they have their
offices in Washington DC
Washington DC is the capital when you
talk about a country's capital it's
where their national government meets
it's the city where the government of a
country is is located in other words
the Capitol building the White House the
Supreme Court these are all located in
Washington DC in America because
Washington DC let me write this down
here for you washing sun washington d.c
DC stands for district of columbia and
it is the city right here it's not in a
state
it's its own little area it's not part
of any state of america it has its own
special area Washington DC the District
of Columbia and that's where the capital
of the United States is don't be
confused because there is a state right
here this is Washington State so don't
get confused between those two okay
Washington State is here Washington DC
is a city that's right here it's
actually much smaller than this picture
okay so don't get confused between the
two okay Washington DC is a city about
right there that's the capital where the
government of a country is located in
Korea what is the capital that's right
it's Seoul Seoul is the capital of Korea
okay
safety so we're talking about government
and government services as we saw the
firefighter and the policeman they are
very important because they help keep us
safe they want to keep people safe so
we're talking about safety safety means
not being in any danger
you are not in danger if you're not in
danger you are safe normally usually we
are not in danger right okay normally oh
we are safe we are safe okay and we're
talking about that adjective safety
oh I'm sorry noun would be safety
adjective is safe we are safe let's get
to let's get to safety so you use this
as a noun let's get to safety and as an
adjective safe we
are safe okay next one importance
importance important long word many
syllables important having a big effect
effect is like result remember effect is
like result so something has a big
result or is something is very powerful
in a group or for an event it's very
important the effect or the result is
very big it's important in this case
this person is important this person
could be the leader could be the boss or
the president and many other people
listen or follow the leader so this
person is important because this person
has a big effect but not just people
many things are important right objects
are things in your life that are
important have a big effect on your
lives okay here we have a firefighter a
firefighter is someone who helps keep us
safe right we talked about this before
we saw the example of the policeman and
the example of firefighter what is a
firefighter a person who professionally
puts out fires so that's an interesting
word right there professionally what
does that mean professionally it's a
person who is a professional and they do
something they do it professionally then
we talk about professional what is a
professional when we talk about
professional we it's helpful to think
about this word to Amma sure amateur
amateur is someone who does something as
a hobby or they do something that they
like to do but they don't get money for
it
for example athletes in the Olympics the
athletes are amateurs they're not
getting paid by a team or a company to
go and compete they're amateurs when
somebody does something and they get
paid for it it's their job they get a
salary for doing it then
they are a professional and if they do
something professionally they're doing
it because it's part of their job
firefighters it's their job to put out
fires they're getting paid for it they
work for the government
by the way firefighters don't just put
out fires they also help in other types
of emergencies like a disaster an
earthquake or if a ball a building falls
down they come out and they help people
to get to safety and they help save
people but their main job is to put out
firefighters that's why they're called
fire fighters okay another type of
government employee these are types of
course of government employee government
employee a government employee
we saw firefighter first another type of
government employee is park ranger
interesting job right many kids
sometimes say I want to be a park ranger
why
what do park rangers do a park ranger is
a person who takes care of they take
care of national parks or forests so if
you think about a national park like
Chitti son or so takusan
very beautiful places right nice
mountains trees but many people go there
right it's a problem if people throw
their trash or if they walk anywhere off
the trail other people the government
who work for the government they have to
make sure that these areas are used
correctly that people don't destroy
those areas or that the area is in good
shape they take care of national parks
and forests and you can see an example
of a park ranger here he's looking
around maybe he's looking for a forest
fire right Park Rangers also put out
fires
they might be involved in that so park
rangers are people who take care of
national parks our forests they make
sure that they're beautiful
and nice places for everybody to visit
who
does that service the government does so
a park ranger is a government employee
okay we have a lot of different
government services and a lot of
different government employees on this
chart where you see government services
these are the services that the
government provides and we can see
different types of jobs we talked about
firefighter already these guys are
pretty cool right okay but there are
firefighters right that's one type of
government employee another one is a
teacher do you think teachers work for
private companies no the teachers work
for the government especially in
elementary school middle school in high
school they work for the government so
that your teacher is a government
employee and the government service to
the public is education everybody should
have a good education that is a
government service so teachers are
government employees next one is
government workers government workers
could be leaning lots of different jobs
you know they could be building
something they could be putting down a
sewer lines or something under the
street to make sure that the cities and
the streets and the towns are working
correctly so there's many types of jobs
for government workers if you go to the
library your city probably has a library
and if you go to that library it's run
by the government so the people who work
there the librarian the librarian can be
a government employee especially if it's
a library that's provided by the
government especially city government
right there are some Seoul City
Libraries or other cities in Korea of
course have libraries as well
these are provided by the city
government and these people work in
those places they are librarians a park
ranger of course we talked about the
Park Rangers take care of a National
Forest or Park and they make sure it's
good for everybody else and we also
talked about police officers too
police officers are very important in
society they protect us and they make
sure that we are protected from other
people who might do bad things so police
officers are very important for our
society okay let's move on to the
exercise we're gonna match the words to
the right definition what are the words
the words are government government by
the way it's interesting when you
pronounce government government
government you're not really pronouncing
n it's government government but don't
forget there is an N there but it's
pronounced government it you don't hear
it okay next one government service
government service okay president
president capital capital safety safety
and important important okay important
okay so let's match the words to their
proper definitions number one having a
big effect a big result something that
has a big result what is it of course it
is important it's important number two
the leader of a country somebody who is
in charge of a country they're
responsible right they lead the country
people follow them they have the big
ideas that they want other people to
support them right they want people to
support their ideas the leader of a
country would be a president we saw the
video of President Barack Obama okay
number three not being in any danger so
not in danger not in danger most of the
time we are not in danger right we are
safe
so if we're talking about the noun form
of safe we say safety right safety is
the noun of safe safe as an adjective we
are in safety we have to get to safety
for example okay number four the group
of people that controls a commune
so we're not talking about one person
we're talking about a group of people
like for example Congress or
Parliament's okay
assembly a group of people that controls
a community and it's not just Congress
but it's also all the branches of
government all the parts of government I
just said what it was
governments right government is the
group of people that controls a
community and by the way a community can
be many things a community can be a
nation a community can be a state a
community can be a city a town a village
you have different levels of government
right so you have a city government a
state government and a national
government but it's just a group of
people that controls a community but
different levels of government number
five a thing that a government does for
a community so a government does certain
things for a community what are those
things we call those government services
or a government service singular plural
government services okay number six the
city where the government of a country
is so the government has to be somewhere
in a country right and it's the city
where the government buildings and
offices are located what do we call that
city that city is the capital city the
capital of a country Seoul is the
capital of Korea Washington DC is the
capital of America okay we have a chart
here when we talk about governments and
we've talked about presidents right we
can look at our history of the countries
right and we can remember important
presidents important leaders of a
country in America we have three
examples very famous and very important
presidents of course there are many
important presents these are just three
of them I won't say that the three most
important but there are three important
presidents okay number one we have a
picture of course of each President and
down
we have their name and what they did
number one is Thomas Jefferson have you
heard that name before
Thomas Jefferson was of course very
important in the United States not just
because he was a president but even
before he was a president what did he do
he wrote the Declaration of Independence
so be even before Thomas Jefferson
became president he helped make America
independent from Great Britain from
England he wrote the Declaration of
Independence he had some help
sure but he was the main person who
wrote the Declaration of Independence
very important person to help make
America a new country in Washington DC
he is so important of course that in
Washington DC they have built a building
it's a round building to put his statue
in and this is called the Jefferson
Memorial it's in Washington DC as you
can see it's a very impressive monument
to remember the very important person
who was a very important of course to
the United States of America very
important to creating a new nation
that's Thomas Jefferson his statue is
there a very big statue okay
now we're on the next president the next
president we're talking about is Abraham
Lincoln we can see his picture here by
the way it's interesting these pictures
are very familiar you can see them very
often if you're in America and you use
American money these pictures are on
American money the paper money just like
if you look at a Korean bill like Chun
100 Chun Hwan a yellow Chon one and you
have Mon Juan you have pictures of
different people don't you well the same
thing here Jefferson is on the $2 bill
he's on the $2 bill and Abraham Lincoln
is on the $5 bill okay so these are
presidents who are very important
obviously in American history their
pictures are
on American money Jeffersons on the $2
bill Abraham Lincoln is on the
five-dollar bill what did Abraham
Lincoln do Abraham Lincoln gave freedom
to African Americans
he made a policy to give all black
Americans freedom after the Civil War
the Emancipation Proclamation it gave
all the slaves freedom after the Civil
War a long time ago about a hundred and
fifty years ago in American history
okay so that's Abraham Lincoln and our
third president is Franklin Roosevelt
Franklin Roosevelt Franklin Roosevelt
was very important in a certain part of
American history
by the way he's more modern right he's
in the 1900s right Thomas Jefferson is
1700s Abraham Lincoln is 1800s Franklin
Roosevelt is 1900s
what did Franklin Roosevelt do well he
did many things he was also president
during a very difficult time for America
he made laws that gave people jobs when
President Roosevelt was the president
there was a very bad economic time in
America called the Great Depression and
Franklin Roosevelt made policy it's
called the New Deal it gave people many
jobs it put them back to work many
people didn't have jobs at that time and
the economy was really really bad but
Roosevelt helped improve the American
economy by getting people back to work
and giving them jobs a lot of government
programs okay let's take a look at the
pictures and write the word that best
describes them okay so we have different
pictures we have Thomas Jefferson here
Franklin Roosevelt here and Abraham
Lincoln here the past beep of the United
States what do all these men have in
common they are all past presidents the
past presidents of the United States
that's what they have in common so
Thomas Jefferson for
Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln let's take
a look at our true/false questions
number one a park ranger is the leader
of a country sounds good
a park ranger is the leader of a country
what does a park ranger do a park ranger
takes care of the national forests or
parks they don't run the country so
that's not correct that's false right we
have to change that it's not a park
ranger as the leader of the country who
is the leader of a country do you
remember that's right it's a president a
president a president is the leader of a
country so the president is a leader of
a country okay number two government
service is a thing that a government
does for a community so we talked about
service right a government service to
keep people safe to put out fires to
teach kids give them an education these
are government services these are things
right our government does these things
for the community that's true absolutely
that is true government service is a
thing that a government does for the
community okay number three a president
AHA a president we're talking about that
before a president is the city where the
government of a country is does that
make sense a president is a person not a
place a city is a place that doesn't
make sense that's not true that's false
because a president is a person not a
place right how do we change this we
have to say a capital a capital is the
city not the president right a capital
is the city where the government of a
country is so we would have to change
that sentence okay that wraps it up for
the vocabulary section don't go away
we're gonna take a short break come back
and look at the reading so stay with us
okay welcome back to the reading section
let
talk about the reading passage which
describes the government of a country or
city and we're also going to talk about
details of that government in the first
statement of course it gets to what we
were talking about before right the fact
that there are governments for different
places right there are governments for
towns cities states and countries
remember I talked about different levels
of government levels of governments so
there are many different communities all
of these are different communities a
town is a community a city is a
community a state is a community and a
country is a community they're just
different sizes so each level each
community will have its own government
each community will have a different
level of government now the largest
community of course is a country that's
the largest community and it's the
largest government we call the
government of a country we say it's the
National national government whoops
slow down here national the national
government is the country's government
that's on the level of the country so
national government who leads the
national government
well a president is the leader of a
country that person is the leader of the
national government at that level the
government of the United States is
chosen by the people of the United
States this is very important of course
in the history not only of the United
States but also the history of the world
right the United States was one of the
first democratic countries in the world
it's very important that they had a new
type of government a democracy at the
beginning of the vocabulary lesson we
talked about different governments right
some governments are not democratic they
are controlled very tightly are very
strictly by one person or a very small
group of people who don't
but in a democratic country like the
United States the people choose the
people choose who their government will
be right they elect those people they
choose the president they choose the
people in Congress okay that's very
important for a democratic country the
government of a country is in the
capital of a country so we talk about
where is the government whereas the
government located we say it's located
in the capital of a country what is the
capital of America
the capital of the United States is
washington d.c remember I told you DC
stands for District of Columbia District
of Columbia don't be confused Columbia
don't be confused with Washington DC in
Washington state right they're very far
away from each other okay
so Washington DC is the capital city of
America because it's the capital city it
has a nickname a nick name a nickname is
another name whoops a nick name is
another name I made a little mistake
there nickname it's one word a nickname
is another name that you know people
will give to something or someone you
might have a nickname your friends might
call you a name that's not your real
name
it's your nickname same thing Washington
DC it is the nation's heart so
Washington DC could be called the
nation's heart just like New York City
is called the Big Apple so New York City
their nickname is the Big Apple
Washington DC the nickname nation's
heart okay the government runs the
country runs the country makes the
country safe makes the country stable so
things aren't crazy
right to make sure that everything is
safe everybody's happy the government
runs the country by off
government services to communities this
is what governments do and again you
have different levels of government
different levels of service right you
have national services you have state
services you have city services each
city government offers services like
police officers firefighters our city
government right Park Rangers our
national government okay so you have
different levels of government different
levels of services so police officers
firefighters and Park Rangers are
important government services they help
that help people and look after our
safety that's the important thing right
there so police officers keep us safe
firefighters put out fires keep us safe
Park Rangers also keep us safe they look
for fires in national parks they also
make sure the national parks and forests
are safe places and fun places to visit
so they help people and they look after
look after means you be careful of
something to be careful of something
look after take care of they mean the
same thing look after our safety so
these people are interested in keeping
us safe okay how let's take a look at
this little bit of details a police
officer helps keep us safe in our
community right a firefighter
puts out fires and a park ranger looks
after nature in our national parks so we
see examples of these before we saw that
there were three people mentioned police
officers firefighters and Park Rangers
then here we have a little bit more
detail about each job and what they do
so police officer keeps us safe
protects us from bad people if you have
a problem you should find a police
officer they will help keep you safe and
help solve your problem if you have
there's a fire called
fire fighters right they put out fires
and Park Rangers if you go to a national
park and you see a park ranger the Park
Rangers will give you advice they also
take care of our parks forests to make
sure that they're safe and that we can
enjoy them well and that's what they do
they look after nature in our national
parks okay let's take a look at the
reading skill cause and effect okay so
we have a situation and we have a result
of that situation here we have our main
idea here the government offers
government services the government
offers government services and they
offer different types of services those
are kind of like the situation's they
there are the causes police officers
beep and beep we have to fill those in
right but these are the causes these are
the situations what is the effect of
these remember effect is like something
that is important has a big effect right
so has a big results so here we have
police officers what do police officers
do what is the effect of police officers
what is the result of having police
officers the result is police officers
look after our what look after our what
our safety our Park Rangers or our
firefighters of course fire police
officers look after our safety they make
sure that we are safe so they look after
our safety here beep what is it it says
put out fire right put out fire put out
fires right who does that
of course firefighters firefighters a
firefighter will put out a fire the next
one down it's blank what is the detail
look after nature so look after nature
take care of trees and animals make sure
national parks are safe and enjoyable of
course who does that Park Rangers do
that so Park Rangers look after nature
ok let's take a look at the reading
comprehension questions how well do you
the reading number one what is the
capital of the United States what is the
capital city of the United States we
have three choices very interesting
Jefferson DC Lincoln DC or Washington DC
which is the answer did you get it
of course it's Washington DC they're
trying to trick you
Washington is of course named after
George Washington the first president of
the United States Lincoln we know
Abraham Lincoln was also a president but
we don't name the capital after him it's
not Lincoln DC Jefferson was also a
president but there's no I don't think
there's any city named Jefferson DC
there might be towns called Jefferson
I'm sure there are but uh there's no the
capital is not called Jefferson DC so
they're trying to trick you these are
all names of past presidents right but
of course the president that we honor by
naming using his name after our capital
city is George Washington the first
president of the United States it's
Washington DC by the way what George
Washington is on the $1 bill his picture
okay number two a beep is someone who
looks after forests so someone who looks
after takes care of right they want to
make sure that those places are fun and
safe for us to to visit what kind of
person does that we're looking for a job
some job description right so a park
ranger be firefighter see police officer
what is it did you get it
yep it's a park ranger a park ranger is
someone who looks after forests
firefighters don't look after forests
they put out fires usually buildings in
towns and cities police officers just
keep us safe from bad people Park
Rangers look after forests okay number
three how does the government run a
country how does a government run a
tree we have many choices a by putting
out fires okay B by offering government
services to communities C by making sure
that the president is chosen which one
is the best answer of these a by putting
out fires does government only put out
fires it's true the government does put
out fires firefighters work for the
government so the government does put
out fires but is it the only thing that
the government does no it's not
government does much much much more than
just put out fires so a is not the
appropriate answer B by offering
government services to communities
that's more general isn't it that
describes the much much more that the
government does putting up fires is just
one of those services the government
runs a country by offering many
government services to communities B is
the correct answer
how about C just look at it for practice
by making sure that the president is
chosen okay well the government does run
elections that's true but that's only
one service right we need the most
appropriate answer which is B by
offering government services all of
these services to communities okay
number four police officers and
firefighters so we need some sentence
that is true for both police officers
and firefighters a are the only people
who can choose our leaders are the only
people who can choose our leaders so
when we elect a president we can't do it
unless we're a firefighter or a police
officer does that sound right no of
course not
everybody is involved in choosing our
leaders right all citizens not just
police officers and firefighters that's
not appropriate B look after our
national parks and put out fires o put
out fires
that's a firefighter right but look
after national parks do police officers
look after national parks no do
firefighters look after national parks
no that's not correct see police
officers and firefighters do important
government services for our safety is
that true they work for the government
they provide a service and they both
make sure that we are safe absolutely
that is true the answer is C okay let's
take a look at our chart again we can
see that there are many different types
of government services available many
different types of people who work for
the government these are all government
employees let's take a look up here we
have two guys wearing jackets yellow
jackets and they have black helmets on
their heads they look like they have
good equipment to go put out a fire so
people who put out a fire what do we
call them we call them a fire fighter
this person here she looks like she's in
a classroom right she has her blackboard
she has many books students come to
school and they learn from people like
her of course many schools are run by
the government especially elementary
school middle school and high school
these are run by the government these
people work for the government they are
called a teacher they are called a
teacher or teachers okay next one down
now these gentlemen these men here they
have many many different kinds of jobs
they could be doing many different kinds
of things they could be building
something they could be repairing
something basically they help make sure
a city or a town works correctly and
everything is nice and clean and safe
what are they what do we call them we
call them government workers because
they work for the government if they
work for a private company
they're just company workers or workers
but if they work for the government they
are government workers over here where
is this lady here this woman is in a
building looks like there are many books
that you can go and check out and you
can read a lot of books if you need help
you want to find a book you can ask her
to help you also she makes sure that
everything's quiet where does she work
she works at a library and many
libraries are a run by the government so
what type of government employee is she
she is a librarian over here this this
man here he looks very serious right
he's got his hat on he's got his
binoculars around his neck he probably
works in the outdoors he works outside
he looks after the forests and the parks
of a nation so what is his job he is
called a park ranger finally we have
these men here and women by the way you
notice they're all wearing blue uniforms
blue is a very common color for this
type of job so we could a nickname for
these these people here are called
men and women in blue men and women in
blue and they of course they keep us
safe they protect us from bad people
what kind of government employee are
they they are called police officers an
officer is a good word to use because it
means both men and women just like
firefighter can be both men and women
okay so these are all types of
government services government employees
and that's what we're talking about
we're talking about the United States
government but specifically our focus is
on the services that the government
provides remember there are different
levels of government and different
levels of services we have city town
national government the leader of a
national government is called the
president
okay so we've taken a look at a lot of
different types of government services
and that's kind of interesting to think
about when you think about your
government okay well hope you learned a
lot take care everybody see you next
time
