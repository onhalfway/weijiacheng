<p>üíì [Lesson 02 | Life Cycle of a Plant]
== Life Cycle of a Plant ==</p>
<p>A plant changes as it grows. All of these changes make a plant‚Äôs life cycle . A plant goes through many stages in its life cycle. A plant begins life as a seed . Flowers make fruit that hold seeds. A seed has a baby plant inside. Seeds have special seed coats to protect them. A seed can also come from a cone . The seed sprouts and becomes a seedling . A seedling is a young plant. As it grows up, it becomes taller and thicker. The seedling grows into an adult plant. When the plant grows up, new seeds will begin a new life cycle. </p>

hello everybody and welcome back I'm
your teacher for today's lesson Brian
Stewart we've talked about part 1 lesson
1 in life science when we were talking
about the parts of a plant in lesson 2
we are going to talk about the life
cycle of a plant how does a plant grow
it's really amazing I'm sure you will
find that out after this lesson in this
lesson you will discover the life cycle
of a plant but what do we mean what do
we mean by the life cycle cycle is
something that goes around and around
like your bicycle right you have to cite
two wheels on your cycle that go around
and around this is a cycle when we talk
about life cycle every living thing goes
through a cycle from a very small baby
growing into an adult dies and then
another organism grows in its place this
is what happens with plants they have a
life cycle it's the cycle of life let's
get started into our lesson here we see
the life cycle as I've described before
the life cycle is the cycle of life
it's how something grows into an adult
and then dies and then comes back and
grows again life all around us is going
through this cycle we can see examples
of babies we can see examples of of
teenagers for example middle part and we
can see examples in the middle part of a
life and then we see examples of things
that die this is all part of the life
cycle it's the series of changes the
series of changes occurring in an animal
or plant like I said all life goes
through a series of changes in the life
cycle ok what we are also going to start
off with
very beginning of the lifecycle for a
plant what is that remember in Lesson
one we talked about the seed and I said
we would talk more about that later it's
very important well that's what we're
talking about now the seed is a very
important part of the lifecycle the seed
is the small part of a plant
remember what makes the seed that's
right fruit inside the fruit we have
seeds so the seed is a small part of a
plant from which a new plant may be
grown so the fruit that contains seeds
when we eat it or the fruit is carried
along by something else like an animal
they open up the seeds fall out and then
they will grow again
some in many cases of course human
beings will take the seeds and we will
put them in the ground to make them grow
a seedling when we put the seed in the
ground and after a while if we give it
good ground or soil and we give it some
water what happens a very small plant
starts to grow that is called a seed
Ling you guys practice seed Ling
seedling a seedling is a very young
plant like a baby plant that comes out
from a seed it's a very small plant that
comes out it's really amazing if you
have time and you can watch it but
usually we don't have that kind of time
it takes some time but if we use a video
a special video technique and we take a
picture once every once in a while then
we put it all together it's very amazing
to watch a seed Ling grow from a seed
let's take a look we have a video ok see
here we have many different seeds in the
ground Wow look at that they're growing
up like little seedlings so we have the
time through this photography you know
that it's not it doesn't grow this fast
of course this videos are taken over a
long period of time and speed it up so
that we can see how these seeds will
grow and they will make little seedlings
they will sprout up through the ground
it's really amazing
isn't it okay so what we saw there like
the word that I used sprout right we're
using this word as a verb right I said
these seeds will sprout up right now we
can imagine there's a seed under the
ground here and this seedling is
sprouting up through the dirt so if a
plant sprouts new leaves begin to grow
on it so basically what's it what's
happening is this seedling is growing up
and it starts to put out leaves right
away okay very quickly because leaves
are a very important part of the plant
okay now it's very important that the
seed is protected right if the seed
needs to have some kind of shell or coat
around it to protect it from the
elements to protect it from insects for
example a seed coat covers and protects
a seed so you can see it's been taken
away here this part is the seed coat
normally it covers the whole seed but
this seed is about to grow so it looks
like it broke off it's going to start
growing now but if you take a look at
the apple you open up the apple you've
got the small dark brown seeds that
actually that dark brown coloring is the
coat of the seed and this is a different
kind of seed here
but it's the seed coat it's like you put
on a coat to protect yourself that's
exactly what this is here a seed coat a
cone is where some the seeds will grow
now this is a special kind of cone right
you see these in the fall and especially
in the winter if you go into the forest
into a pine forest there are many pine
trees around in Korea if you go into the
forest like maybe some of the national
parks like saw rocks on Warhawks on
chitosan right
you can see all of these different cones
on the ground and they're lying around
these are pine cones and inside the cone
there are little sea
so a cone that has many seeds is the
fruit of the pine tree so it's strange
to think that this is fruit isn't it of
course you wouldn't eat that oh it would
be terrible and also would it would hurt
your mouth but this is the type of fruit
that a pine tree grows so we don't eat
the fruit of a pine tree right we eat
the fruit of an apple tree or a lemon
tree but we don't eat the fruit of a
pine tree but it's still a kind of fruit
and this is the kind of fruit that a
pine tree produces and like we saw
inside the fruit our seeds so this is a
type of fruit as well interesting an
adult we've talked about the seed we've
talked about the seedling and after a
long time we have an adult and of course
a tree takes a very very long time to
grow some trees are hundreds of years
old right if you can imagine that an
adult an adult means fully grown so if
it's an adult plant if it's an adult dog
or if it's an adult human being it means
it is fully grown it's in the final
stage of growth it's fully grown now
let's review here we've talked a little
bit about the life cycle right we've
talked about the seed we've talked about
the seedling we've talked about fruit
that gives more seeds and we've talked
about adult let's take a look at this
example of a lifecycle ah and I like
this plant right Algy mushy soil right
very delicious so I like this plant this
is a good example first of course we
start here let's start here we can see
somebody did you know that a strawberry
seed looks like that I didn't know that
but that's very interesting so of course
we start with the seed we put the seed
in the ground you can also say we're
planting to plant a seed plant whoops
plant see oh there we go seed so that's
very interesting because we see plant is
not only a noun it's also a verb we
plant to see
we put it in the ground what happens
after we plant it
well what grows next a seedling grows a
seedling will grow from that seed if we
give it some time water and water after
the seedling grows we have this plant
here what do we call this we call these
growing plants they are growing they're
getting bigger they are developing just
like you are growing okay but in this
case the plants are growing what do we
have here we have flowers oops
among the different strawberries
strawberry flowers these strawberry
flowers are white and yellow okay so
they're very beautiful they're very
pretty and of course we can see many
flowers in the spring now up here the
plants are in their adult stage these
are adult plants but what do we have
here this of course our fruit and inside
the fruit are new seeds these seeds can
be found inside the strawberries okay so
that's great so next time you want to
have strawberries you know great they're
very delicious and remember that you can
use those stars you can eat it or you
can use the seeds to plant in the ground
and grow new strawberry plants so that's
a very interesting cycle this is of
course all part of the plant life cycle
and continual growth the plant will grow
into an adult
it will give fruit and from the fruit we
get seeds and it repeats again and again
just like the wheels on your bicycle it
is a cycle it goes around and around ok
let's review here let's do a little
exercise we're going to review the words
that we talked about so far in a series
of exercises ok so match each word with
its definition what do these words mean
the words are seed coat seedling sprout
lifecycle cone and seed so let's talk
about these words what do they how can
we define them how
can we explain these words number one
this series of changes of a living thing
so remember I talked about that a lot
right I compared it to the to the wheel
on your bicycle right cycle it is of
course the series of changes of a living
thing we're talking about a life cycle
now talking you know it's kind of
similar to your bicycle because it goes
around and around but this is life cycle
not bicycle life the cycle the wheel of
life okay
number two when new leaves begin to grow
new leaves begin to grow so at the very
beginning when the plant is just coming
up out of the ground when new leaves
begin to grow what is it doing it is
sprouting remember sprout is a verb it's
the action it's the process of the plant
just beginning to grow it is sprouting
okay also when a plant makes new leaves
you can say it is sprouting leaves okay
number three the part that covers and
protects the seed remember when I talked
about this I said it's like you put on
something what do you put on to protect
yourself from the cold you put on a coat
well the seed has a coat - it already
has one it doesn't put it on it's
already got one when it when it when
it's is a seed and that protects the
seed so the part that covers and
protects the seed is called the seed
coat okay let's move on the next one
oops
I already went I want to went too fast
but anyway that's okay a young plant
growing out of a seed is of course a
seed linge right so the very small part
of the plant as it grows is just coming
out of the ground we call that a seed
Ling okay the next question number five
the small part from which a new plant
may be grown the small part from which a
new plant may be grown what can we see
here we can see of course that is the
seed it's a very small part okay as we
saw even a big tree like a pine tree
inside the cones such a small part and
we put it in the ground and a very very
big pine tree grows out of that it's
amazing is
from such a small seed such large trees
and plants can grow okay number six the
fruit of a pine tree it has many seeds
so remember we talked about the fruit of
a pine tree you can't eat it right that
would be horrible it would taste
horrible and - it would hurt your mouth
I'll buy all right that would be
terrible
but what do we call that we call that
the cone the pine cone especially but
it's the cone it has many seeds the
fruit of a pine tree okay now we're
going to talk about a little bit about
how seeds travel we've talked about
seeds seeds are the very start of the
lifecycle they begin the life cycle but
think about it if the plant grows the
tree of the plant grows the seed and the
seed falls down right next to the plant
right it's gonna crowd out it's gonna be
too crowded they're gonna grow too close
together so did you know that seeds
actually travel plants can't travel
right they stay they're grown in the
ground they can't move but the seeds can
move in some cases seeds move very far
distances they move very far away how do
they travel there are many different
ways that seeds can travel some seeds
float in the air right so you see this
is a dandelion right and these are the
little seeds and they're very light and
the wind comes by and they blow they
they take off and they blow away in the
wind
some trees of course have pollen there
types of seeds and in the springtime
people get allergies sure right because
the seeds might get into your nose but
these are seeds these are examples of
seeds traveling through the air
sometimes seeds are eaten by animals and
this is where fruit comes into play
right this is a type of fruit an animal
will come by it will eat the fruit and
it will eat the seeds too the seeds will
go inside the animal and this is a
little disgusting I'm sorry but the bird
will fly away to another place and it
will go to the bathroom and the seed
will come out and you know it's not a
very good environment well actually it
is a good environment
for the seed because the seed likes the
other stuff that the bird is is going to
the bathroom because it uses that to
grow it uses that as its food it's a
little disgusting to think about but
that's life that's science
so sometimes seeds are eaten by animals
the animal will go away go to the
bathroom and the seed will grow from
where the animal went to the bathroom
okay this is much a cleaner way to
travel floating on water right this seed
is very lucky okay it's very clean it
will fall into the water rain will come
down it might go into a stream and it
will float somewhere and maybe it will
stop maybe the rain it will get to drive
the water will go away and the seed will
stop and it will start to grow where it
was carried by water this is a much
cleaner way to travel than this way
right okay finally do you have a dog
sometimes if you have a dog and he goes
you take that dog for a walk through the
forest or through some place where there
are a lot of lot of plants well the poor
dog sometimes gets a lot of things stuck
to its fur stick to to get stuck to
things also you if you have if you're
hiking in the mountains and you go off
the trail try not to go off the trail
but sometimes people will go off the
trail the plants will brush against your
legs and you get home and you look at
your socks and your socks have all these
little pieces of the plant in them those
are seeds that stick to your clothing or
to your dog's fur and of course they
will be carried a long ways and then
hopefully come off later so these are
four very interesting ways that seeds
travel just to summarize they float in
air they get eaten by animals and they
get you know the bathroom the animals go
to the bathroom so the seeds will come
out in that part
sometimes seeds will float on the water
and sometimes seeds will stick to things
like dogs hair or your socks okay and
these are all different ways that seeds
will travel and plant or grow in another
place
away from their parents okay okay let's
move on so let's review here let's take
a look
get these pictures these are all
pictures showing a different stage or a
different part of the life cycle what
would be the first part of the life
cycle we can see different pictures here
here we have seedlings here we have
seeds here we have an adult tree this
looks like another like a growing plant
okay so what is the first part of course
we start with the seed and we're talking
about pine trees here so this is the
cone from the cone come the seeds if the
seeds are in the ground they get
traveled they travel by a lot of
different ways they go to a new location
what happens next of course is that they
become seedlings so this is the second
stage in our life cycle now after the
seedlings have some time they grow a
little bit bigger and they become
growing plants a growing plants okay of
course our last stage in the life cycle
is the adult tree the adult pine tree so
like I said before it's really amazing
when you think about out of such a small
seed such a large adult plant will grow
and these are the steps or the stages in
the life cycle that they will go through
in order to become a full adult okay
let's move on let's go over a little
review we've see some different
sentences let's see if they are true or
false so Circle T for true or circle F
for false our first sentence a seed
grows out from a seedling does that
sound correct it sounds like something
got switched around doesn't it a seed
grows out from a seedling I think the
order is mixed up it should be that the
seed is what gives rise to a seedling so
we need to change the order of these two
things we have to say a seedling grows
out from a seed that would be correct
this is incorrect right so it's false
what we have here of course is a seed
grows out from a seed link that's
incorrect a seedling grows out from a
seed okay I went too fast here you
already see that it's false but that's
okay a cone is the brightly colored
leaves of a flower that's false
obviously as we saw with the pine tree
the pine tree is not brightly colored
right the pine cone is dark brown right
and it's not something you would want to
eat it's not something that's very
beautiful some people might think it's
beautiful they do make decorations from
it but it's not brightly colored it's a
dull color dull brown so this is
incorrect as we can see it's false so a
cone is a brightly colored leaves of a
flower
no the cone is a the strong hard shell
it's a fruit of a pine tree that holds
the seeds let's take a look at number
three a seed coat protects a seed that
sounds reasonable remember we have a
coat when we put on a coat it protects
us from the cold or the wind so a seed
coat will protect a seed that is true
right so a seed coat protects a seed
okay we've covered a lot of different
things here I think it's time for a
short break take a rest and we'll be
back soon hello everybody and welcome
back let's go over the reading section
for the life cycle of a plant here we
have a short reading passage let's go
over it together I'll plant changes as
it grows so this is our topic sentence
right this tells us that the reading
passage is going to be about the changes
the changes that a plant goes through as
it grows all of these changes make a
plant's life cycle that's what we're
talking about the life cycle of a plant
each part of the cycle there is a
different change a plant goes through
many stages in its life cycle so stage
different stages
different stages of course seedling
that's one stage growing plant that's
another stage adult that is another
stage and then again back to seed of
course another stage these are all
different stages in the life cycle do
you want to see a really interesting
video we'll see the first stages of a
plant's life cycle let's take a look as
we can see somebody's putting the plant
in they're covering it with soil or
ground pat it away now let's see what
happens
woah look the earth is moving it seems
like it's by itself the plant Wow
look at that it's coming out of the
ground Wow and it's raising up Wow isn't
that amazing that's really cool and
there we have it there we have our
seedling and look the first thing that
comes up we have two leaves wow that's
amazing that's the very beginning of the
lifecycle it's really amazing when you
look at life how it how it is happening
all around us and this of course is the
very first stage of a plant's life cycle
so a plant begins life as a seed we saw
the person put the seed into the ground
cover it with the dirt Pat it maybe put
a little love there nice okay so that it
would grow well flowers make fruit that
hold seeds so where does seeds come from
right seeds come from the fruit the
inside these are apple seeds a seed has
a baby plant inside we saw the baby
plant come up out of the ground seeds
have special seed coats we can see the
seed coats that protect the the seed
that protect them yeah so seeds have
special seed coats to protect them to
protect them from insects from water
from for many different things
it holds the seed and and protects the
very delicate part of the plant that's
going to grow out of the ground
so a seed can also come from a cone it
doesn't always have to come from fruit
like an apple or looks like a little
being here bean sprout we that I'm sorry
a bean pod or an apple remember a seed
can also come from a cone as we saw the
pinecone and of course that's not fruit
don't eat that
okay that would be terrible the seed
sprouts and becomes a seed Ling so we
have a couple of key words here again
sprouts remembers of herb its sprouts we
saw in the video that's a very good
example of how the seed sprouts and
grows sprouts and becomes a seedling
that is the thing that it becomes a
seedling is a young plant of baby plants
as it grows up it becomes taller and
thicker it is a growing plant and then
it becomes an adult plant in the end
right the seedling grows into an adult
plant like what we have here when the
plant grows up the plant generates it
creates new seats new seeds will begin
the new life cycle so when the plant
reaches its adult stage it will produce
fruit whether it's an apple a bean pod
or a pine cone it will produce some kind
of fruit that contains seeds to begin
the cycle again and this of course is
the life cycle then it goes around and
around okay let's take a look at our
reading skill in this case we're looking
at organization again in this case we're
taking a look at sequence sequence means
the order in which things happen so if
you're talking about sequence you can
say first second third and so on what is
the order of the events what happens
first what happens second what happens
third and what happens finally or fourth
okay so we are talking about sequencing
as an organizational style
of writing in this case we're talking
about the life cycle of a plant what are
what is the sequence what are the stages
first of all we have our different
stages here and we have blanks
we need to fill these blanks with these
words here what are the words seedling
sprouts seeds cones adult and seedling
so we need to put these words in the
blanks in the proper sequencing order or
proper stage let's look at the first
stage the first stage fruit or beep hold
seeds we talked about this a little bit
I joked about this you don't want to eat
one right it tastes horrible and it will
also hurt your mouth fruit or what will
probably cones hold seeds not probably
for sure fruit or combs hold seeds but
really the cone is like the fruit of a
pine tree but we wouldn't eat it so it's
not fruit you can eat it's a pine cone
fruit or comes hold seeds in the second
stage a seed beep and becomes a or an
beep right a or an because it could
start with a vowel if it starts with a
vowel like this one it needs to have an
let's take a look a seed what what does
a seed do which one of these words is a
verb seedling is a noun sprouts sprouts
is a verb that could fit their seeds is
a noun cones is a noun
adult is a noun seedling and so now the
only word that really fits is sprouts
and it's correct to a seed sprouts a
seed sprouts it starts to grow a seed
sprouts and becomes what it becomes a
seed linga okay so a seed sprouts and
becomes a seed link we don't need n
right just a seedling okay that's the
second stage in the third stage we can
see a what grows
into a what plants okay actually we need
an adjective here but we'll get to that
in a second first of all what grows into
that a seedling we use this word again a
seedling because we're continuing the
stage it becomes a seedling then a
seedling grows into a what type of plant
which verb which word here is also an
adjective adult before I said is a noun
an adult he is an adult that's a noun
but we can also use adult as an
adjective
can't we it is an adult plant it is an
adult human being so we can also use
this word as an adjective here grows
into an adult plant okay so we have a
seedling grows into an adult plant
that's the third stage what's the fourth
stage and the fourth stage is returning
back to the beginning of the life cycle
new beep begin a new life cycle so the
adult will make fruit that holds seeds
and these seeds begin a new life cycle
so if we take a look at this this is the
sequence these are the different stages
of a life cycle it cut starts here goes
to the second third stage final stage
and actually goes back and starts again
okay let's go over some reading
comprehension questions how well do you
remember the information in the reading
here we have several sentences that
we're going to go over either we're
going to answer the question or we're
going to fill in the blank inside the
sentence so number one is a question
what do fruit and cones hold what is
inside the fruit or the cones you'll
probably remember this a seeds be
flowers or sea seedlings well if you
guessed seeds you are correct because
inside the fruit or inside the cones we
can find seeds we don't find you know
what do flowers are inside fruit and
that's not correct seedlings are
inside fruit and cones no that's not
correct either it's the seed the seed is
put in the ground and then the seedling
grows but the fruit and cones do not
hold seedlings they hold seeds okay
let's go over question number two
fill-in-the-blank seeds have B that
protect them think about that okay we
talked about that a lot right what do
you have that protects you it's a coat
right so we have a baby plants B seed
coats C young plants of course our
answer is here I talked about coats
right seeds have seed coats that protect
them seeds have baby plants that protect
them that doesn't make sense
seeds have young plants that protect
them no that doesn't make sense
either we saw the picture before of a
seed with the coat around it and that is
what protects them so seeds have seed
coats just like you have a coat that you
put on sometimes to protect you okay
let's move on question number three a
seedling is a young plant that grows a
out of a tree to become a seed sounds
strange B but cannot become an adult
plant C and becomes thicker and taller
so which one of these fits here well I
said a seedling is a young plant that
grows out of a tree to become a seed
that's all mixed up isn't it a is not
the correct answer that's kind of silly
isn't it
that that doesn't make sense okay number
letter B a seedling is a young plant
that grows but cannot become an adult
plant a seedling can't become an adult
plant why not we saw in the life cycle
that it grows into an adult so that is
incorrect right really our only choice
left a seedling is a young plant that
grows and becomes thicker and taller
that's true because as we saw the
seedling is very small very delicate but
as we see after time it becomes a
growing plant finally becomes an adult
it's very in a case of a pine
tree it's very tall and very thick so
see is our correct answer right a
seedling is a young plant that grows and
becomes thicker and taller and of course
all plants do this all animals do this
to you and I have done that me maybe a
little too thick but anyway okay number
four a plant goes through many changes
as it grows and this is called its life
cycle a B and it begins life as an adult
C changing from an adult into a seedling
okay so which sentence makes sense which
sentence is true a plant goes through
many changes as it grows and this this
what is this refer back to this refers
back to many changes okay and this these
many changes is called its life cycle so
the many changes that is called the life
cycle and actually that's true that is
our answer right there okay so we can
see and this is called its life cycle B
and it begins life as an adult that's
crazy
nothing begins life as an adult an adult
as we saw was the final stage the last
stage in the life cycle right see it
changing from an adult into a seedling
it changes from an adult into a seedling
that doesn't make sense either
so a is our correct choice and remember
this refers back to many changes those
many changes are called the life cycle
the many changes we can also say the
many oops we can also say the many
stages because as we saw before the life
cycle has many stages 1st 2nd 3rd and
4th there are many stages in the life
cycle ok so we've talked about the life
cycle of a plant it's really amazing
isn't it
when we think about it this is the cycle
of life all living things go through
this life cycle things start off a well
plants start off as a seed where did the
seeds come from they come from fruit
the seed will turn into a seedling as we
plant it the seedling will become a
growing plant and the growing plant will
become an adult the adult will create or
grow fruit and start the life cycle all
over again so it's really amazing when
you think about it well I hope you've
learned a lot in this lesson we'll take
care everybody and we'll see you next
time goodbye</p></div>
