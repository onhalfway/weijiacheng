<p>Life in the past was harder for people. The way people live now has changed but some things are also similar. People in the past and now need food, shelter, and clothing.
Corn and are wheat kinds of crops. At harvest time, these crops are gathered. In the past, on farms, people harvested crops using their hands. Now, people have machines to help them and the work has become easier. Shelter has also changed. In the past, people lived in small houses. Now people also live in apartments. Our clothing has changed. omen in the past wore dresses only. Women today wear many different kinds of colorful and interesting clothes.</p>

hello everyone welcome back to American
textbook reading I'm Brian Stewart well
we're continuing along in our book
we're on lesson eight right now we're
talking about changes in family life in
this unit you will discover changes in
family life same as the title but what
exactly does that mean if we take a look
at the pictures to warm up for this unit
we can see two different pictures we can
see a picture from a long time ago in
the past women were working very hard in
the home then we see a modern picture of
a young woman and she's not working in
the home she's working in office we can
see many differences between these two
pictures in terms of type of work where
people were working what kind of clothes
they were wearing and the difference is
between the past and the present and
that's what we're talking about when we
talk about changes in family life we're
talking about how have how has things
changed how have things changed from the
past to the present let's take a look at
some words that we're going to talk
about first of all we say family life
right what is life of course life is the
way a person lives of course this is a
different a little bit of a different
picture you know from a baby to a very
old person right this is the life of a
person but life also means how or the
way a person lives and when we talk
about how a person lives or the way in
which a person lives we can also use
another word very similar that's called
life style so what is your life style
what were the lifestyles of people a
long time ago like what are the
lifestyles of modern people so you know
sure we can talk about life of of
different people but especially when we
talk about how people live we're really
talking about life style what is what
are what is their life style
okay another word we can talk about is
dress we saw that a little bit in
picture at the at the first slide of
this lesson right at the first beginning
of this lesson we saw that the women
were wearing different types of clothing
a dress of course is a type of clothing
for women and girls men do not wear
dresses
I hope men do not wear dresses if you
see a man or a boy wearing a dress
that's very strange
maybe that's Halloween or they're it's a
costume but anyway dress is typically
for women and girls traditionally that
was the only clothing that women wore
wear dresses however nowadays women
don't always have to wear dresses but
they do if they want to okay let's move
on to our next one shelter shelter is a
place to live or stay there are many
types of shelters right there are many
types of shelters what type of shelter
do you live in you probably live in an
apartment and apartments that's a very
common type of shelter in Korea right an
apartment Oh what are some other types
of shelter well this looks like a house
it's a large house right well you just
say house you could live in a large
house or you can live in a small house
an apartment a house those are typical
types of shelters but shelter can be
really any building that somebody lives
in or any structure a long time ago
American Indians lived in teepees they
were like tents tent is a type of
structure or shelter so basically any
place that you can go inside you can
stay and that protects you from the
outside environment like rain snow cold
or even heat these things protect you
it's a place to stay they're called
shelters okay before I talked about
dress now we're talking about clothing
again dress is a type of clothing
clothing is just coverings the people
wear and of course there's many types of
clothing right I'm wearing a shirt
that's one type of clothing you could
wear a jacket that's another type
clothing even the shoes on your feet we
consider that as clothing as well these
are things that we put over our bodies
or on our bodies to cover us and they
protect us from the from nature also we
don't call the clothes shelter even
though they do the same thing right
clothes protect us from the environment
shelter protects us from the environment
but there are different types of things
clothings are coverings that we wear
that we put on our body we wear these
things during the day we put on clothes
put on clothes we put on clothes in the
morning and we wear clothes during the
day okay so in the morning you put on
clothes during the day you wear your
clothes
and then at night before you get to bed
you take off your clothes okay so
basically three types of verbs we use
with clothes put on wear take off put on
clothes in the morning or when you try
clothes on in the store you put it on
you wear clothes during the day for the
whole day at night you take off your
clothes get ready for bed okay so
clothing another word that we're talking
about in this unit is krump
what is a crop a crop is a plant that
people grow as food not just any plant
right we go out into nature and we look
at plants not all the plants we find our
crops only the plants that people grow
as food okay for example what are some
types of crops that we grow as food a
very common type of crop in Korea of
course is rice rice is a very very very
common type of crop all over the world
wheat is another one wheat is a crop
these are types of plants that we grow
for food so any type of plant that a
farmer will grow those are called crops
and we eat them we eat them in large
numbers okay of course where do we grow
these foods we grow them on a farm a
farm is a piece of land where people
grow crops or animals right we don't see
really see any crops in this picture
this is a farm but what we do see your
animals so farm is used to grow plants
right as food and also animals as food
so basically we get our food from two
sources right we get our food from Flint
from plants we eat plants for food we
also eat animals for food where do we
get those things from a farm okay so
it's a piece of land or an area where a
farmer right a farmer owns a farm they
grow crops they also grow animals and
they send those products to our stores
we buy them and we can eat something so
farms of course are very important to us
okay when it's time for the farmer to go
out and gather the plants for food right
the plants have to grow right they have
to reach a certain stage before we can
eat them we can't eat the young plants
we have to wait till the plants grow
fully and then we can eat the plants at
that time what is that time it's usually
in the fall and the farmers will go out
and they will harvest they will harvest
the crops harvest means that they will
gather gather together means to get
together you gather together all the
things you gather the gathering of the
crops so the farmer goes out and they
will gather all those crops they will
gather all the rice together they will
gather all the wheat together or the
corn or the cucumbers or the tomatoes
all of these types of plants when they
gather them in that's called the harvest
it's very common you say it's harvest
time it's harvest time and again that
normally happens in the fall right in
the fall it's harvest time the farmer
will go out and gather the crops and
then we have a lot of food okay okay
corn is a type of crop right I thought
we talked about rice we talked about
wheat but corn is also a very common
type of crop corn of course you
recognize corn right corn is a kind of
plant with yellow seeds yellow seeds and
these seeds are big right they're very
delicious too which is used for food so
I'm sure you like corn of course we're
all like popcorn we can use a corn to
make popcorn too but the yellow seeds we
will eat as food let's take a look at a
video this is a farmer in his field and
he is walking through his land on his
farm and he is growing corn you see the
corn plants are very high they're taller
than he is and he's holding an ear of
corn in his hand an ear of corn that's
how we say you know one part of the
plant that we take off - the one part of
the plant that we take off the the whole
plant we call it an ear of corn
now one corn stock will have many ears
of corn
not really ears right but we just call
it that so he will go through and he's
checking on his crops and he's looking
to see what the progress is and maybe he
he broke one off to see if it's ready to
eat or not
it looks like it's harvest time soon
because these plants have grown so high
he will probably harvest his corn very
quickly or soon wheat again is another
type of crop we've talked about rice
wheat and corn here we have wheat again
wheat is a kind of plant with grains
that flour is made from so these grains
we take these grains and we we push them
together we grind them together we grind
wheat grind is when you push with a lot
of force and you make something crumble
into smaller very small pieces and that
of course is flour white flour which you
use to make bread cookies cake all these
different types of things that is made
by wheat those different types of food
so flour is made from wheat wheat is a
very important crop it's for humans okay
so we're talking about you know it seems
like we're talking about farming too
much but what we're our main
focus of course is how people's lives
have changed right how of how has life
changed from the past to the present and
this is what we're looking at here in
this chart so what has changed in family
life we can look at the past we can look
at the present these are the two
different time periods we're looking at
and we're looking at these categories
how has clothing changed in the past
and to the present how has shelter
changed from the past to the present
how has food changed from the past to
the present how have these things
changed let's take a look okay so in the
past clothing women wore dresses right
dresses were very common it was
basically the only type of clothing that
most women wore dresses
if the whim if women wore something
other than a dress it would be very
strange if she wore men's clothes that
wasn't accepted women were only expected
to wear dresses however nowadays women
girls can wear t-shirts and jeans in
fact everybody seems to wear t-shirts
and jeans now all right that's a very
common type of clothing so you know
clothing didn't just change for women it
also changed for men men went from you
know very formal suits are very
different types of clothing to very
casual t-shirt and jeans that are very
common these days so that's how clothing
has changed what about shelter a long
time ago most people lived in farmhouses
right they lived in farms because you
had to be close to the food that you
were growing so most people lived on
farms they lived in farm houses nowadays
many people most people live in city
houses or apartments we talked about
that before but this looks like suburb
right this could be a suburb and there
are many houses in the suburbs suburbs
are just right outside the city right so
you say city house but you know right
outside the city of many suburbs okay
and there's houses housing divisions out
there so a long time ago people lived in
farmhouses because they had to be next
to the food they were growing but
nowadays we have refrigeration we have
trucks we have trains we can transport
food a long distance so we don't have to
live on farms anymore not many people
are involved in farming fewer and fewer
people are farmers they can grow more
and more food so more and more people
can do other things than farm so people
have changed where they live over here
food how has our food changed well a
long time ago in the past people
harvested by hand they gathered the food
by hand that's all that they had they
just had their hands and they would
gather the food together nowadays
however you can harvest by Machine and
that kind of gets back to what we were
talking about here right most people
lived on farm houses because everybody
had to gather food they couldn't grow as
much food but now that you can grow a
lot more food because if you use a
machine you can gather much more food
that allows people to live in city
houses and not everybody has to be a
farmer let's take a look at a video of a
machine that is harvesting a crop so
here we have the crop here looks like
wheat and we have a harvester this
machine is called a harvester and it's
coming along and it's gathering up all
the week and you can see it's it's
chopping it up and it's putting it up on
the on the back of the machine and
basically what it's doing it's gathering
all of this wheat by machine and
obviously that machine just went through
this field really fast it would take a
much much longer time for a person to do
the same thing by hand so machines have
made it possible for us to grow larger
and larger amounts of food very quickly
ok let's go over our word matching
exercise right we're gonna match the
words to their different definitions our
words our life dress shelter shelter
clothing clothing crop crop and farm
farm that's easy ok let's take a look at
the definitions a place to live or to
stay which place is a place to live or
stay now you
could say farm you could live on a farm
too but more general more broad any
place to live or to stay is a shelter
and remember there's many types of
shelters apartments houses farms are
shelters but when we say a place to live
or stay we want the general where we
want the big word we want to go for
shelter that's more appropriate okay the
way a person lives the way a person
lives we talked about that a little bit
that's the life right the life of a
person or lifestyle of a person is the
way that a person lives three coverings
that people wear so we put things over a
body we cover our body bodies with these
things this is called of course clothing
okay let's move on to number four a
plant that people grow as food so we
grow plants for food what do we call
those there are special kinds of plants
right now all plants are crops if we go
out in the forest right and we see weeds
growing those aren't crops a tree that's
not a crop right it's only the plants
that we grow is food and I just gave you
the idea I just gave you the answer it's
a crop right so crops those are plants
that people grow as food trees are not
crops weeds are not crops only things
like wheat rice corn cucumbers tomatoes
those plants that we eat as food those
are crops okay number five a piece of
land where people grow crops or animals
that's much more specific isn't it
that's farm right farm sure a farm can
be a shelter we can live on a farm but
very specifically a farm is a piece of
land where people grow crops or animals
that is a farm number six a type of
clothing for women and girls remember we
talked about this a long time ago women
only wore this type of clothing
typically wore this type of clothing
that would be a dress so women wore
dresses much much more commonly in the
past
okay nowadays people wear t-shirts and
jeans okay let's take a look at our
chart here diff
and the same how are things different
and how are they the same of course in
the past and in the present so here we
have in the past and we're talking also
about the present okay we're talking
about different things what we're doing
here is we see women working this is the
same two pictures we saw at the
beginning of this unit right so these
two pictures are talking about how women
work or where women work these two
pictures are different it's the first
time we saw them looks like they're
playing a game here and they're playing
a game here so how have these two
different things these different
activities changed from the past to the
present let's start off with working
place for women in the past women worked
at home so women who worked at home in
the past today nowadays both women and
men have jobs outside the home so that's
a big difference isn't it between the
past in the past women only worked at
home they it was not acceptable for
women to work outside of the home is
very rare most women worked at home but
nowadays it's very common for women and
men to work outside the home especially
in offices and things like that so
that's a big difference from the past to
the present that shows a big difference
how about about games some of the games
children played in the past have stayed
the same so some of the games that
children were playing in the past
they're the same as that the games that
they play nowadays so that has stayed
the same so basically we see one big
difference and over here we see
something that has stayed the same is a
good expression it has stayed the same
it has not changed okay let's take a
look at the pictures here we're gonna
fill in the blank to complete the
sentences or the sentence only one
sentence the way people live has what's
okay if we take a look at these two
pictures here we can see that in this
picture there are you know different
people they're doing different things
you know they're writing down with with
a feather not a pen this person here is
sewing something sewing the clothes
together look at the style of clothing
vary a lot
clothing very old-fashioned now take a
look it over here these two women are
not working in the house they're working
in an office their style of clothing has
changed are not wearing dresses they're
wearing business suits ah female
business suits so the way people live
has done what it's really changed hasn't
it the way people live has changed from
the past to the present okay let's take
a look at our true/false questions
number one a shelter is a covering that
people wear remember we talked about
this I made I made a comparison between
shelter and something else right but be
careful
both things protect us from the
environment but we live in one place and
we wear another thing so do we wear a
shelter that would be very heavy right
if we wore an apartment or a house we
don't wear a shelter right we live in a
shelter so this sentence is not true
it's false if we change it if we say
clothing and we don't say of clothing
say clothing clothing is non-count so I
say clothing is a covering or coverings
we'd have to change that coverings that
people wear clothing is coverings that
people wear then that would be true but
we have to make a lot of changes to the
sentence so it's false
number two a farm is the gathering of
the crops does that sound right is a
farm and event no farm is a place it's
not an event gathering the crops is an
event and beside there's not right a
farm is where you grow crops but a farm
is not a gathering of the crops that's
not true it's false right if we change
it though and say a harvest if we change
it to that a harvest is the gathering of
the crops that's true but again we have
to change the sentence to make it true
let's take a look at number three
flour is made from wheat does that sound
correct to you guys remember I taught
you guys that word
grind grind when you grind you rubbed
you rub something together you
of it very with a lot of pressure and
you break it down into smaller pieces
you grind wheat and what do you get yeah
you get flour so flour is made from
wheat that is true okay okay so those
are our three sentences true and false
sentences we're gonna take a short break
now we're gonna come back and take a
look at the reading don't go anywhere
okay welcome back let's do the reading
section together now again we're talking
about changes in family life so we're
talking about how things have changed
from the past to the present and that's
what this reading passage will be about
let's take a look life in the past was
harder for people well that's true isn't
it it was much harder to live in the
past than it is to live now the way
people live now has changed but some
things are also similar that's our topic
sentence right there right the way
people live now has changed but some
things are also similar of course
contrasting it with life in the past so
basically this reading passage is going
to talk about how some things have
changed but also how some things have
stayed similar let's take a look people
in the past and now need food shelter
and clothing so that's kind of all the
way things have stayed the same right
people in the past and now so both
periods of time we need food we need
shelter we need clothing those things
have stayed the same those needs have
stayed the same so it's interesting to
note that they're going to talk about
one two and three things in this reading
passage and usually and that's the way
that's reading passages if you say the
first thing first food talk about food
first if your second item is shelter
then talk about shelter second if your
third thing is clothing then talk about
clothing third and last it's the last
thing here so the order in which you
list the items also keep that same order
in which you write about those items if
you're writing and most good writing is
based on this type of organizational
rule
okay so first we saw food is first we're
going to talk about food first
sure enough corn and wheat are kinds of
crops that's talking about food so corn
and wheat are kinds of crops at harvest
time these crops are gathered okay so
we're still talking about food we're
talking about how we gather these foods
right that has stayed the same but the
difference is in the past on farms
people harvested crops using their hands
so in the past people harvested using
their hands now people have machines to
help them and the work has become easier
so the difference is now in the past as
opposed to now there is a difference
people have machines so we use machines
to help them and the work has become
easier so that's the difference before
in the past people use their hands to
gather food now people use machines to
help them and of course the work has
become much easier much faster and very
important fewer people have to do that
work sir more people can live away from
farms okay
that's talking about food now the second
thing we saw was shelter and that's the
second thing we're going to talk about
here shelter has also changed so that's
our next subject the difference between
the past and the present shelter has
also changed in the past so that's in
the past we're talking about the past
there people lived in small houses so
the past people lived in small houses
that was the past now here we have now
people also live in apartments also live
no they notice that they use also that
means they still live some people still
live in small houses but they also live
in apartments now apartments are much
more common nowadays than they were a
long time ago in the past okay
so that's interesting the use of also
indicates that people still live in
small houses and that's true of course
people do still live in small houses but
they also live
apartments that's the second thing
shelter the third thing we were talking
about is clothing and sure enough here
we talk about clothing our clothing has
changed women in the past again in the
past wore dresses they wore dresses only
right women today okay that's now right
women today where are many different
kinds of colorful and interesting
clothes so the difference of course in
the past women wore dresses today they
wear many different kinds of colorful
and interesting clothes right so that's
interesting they're not just dresses
there's lots of different kinds of
colorful and interesting clothing that
women wear these days so this passage is
talking about some of the differences of
course some of the similarities as well
okay so now we've come to our reading
skill and our reading skill is comparing
contrast and of course that's very
appropriate for our reading passage
because in the reading passage we were
talking about in the past and now or
today so we can very easily compare and
contrast the two time periods here in
our chart we can see the past is over
here the present is over here we have 1
2 3 things that are different right that
we contrast and one thing down here that
are similar that we can compare right so
let's take a look at these we need to
fill in the details with these words
down here our words our shelter easier
apartments clothing and only let's see
how they are different ok first of all
in the past people harvested crops using
the hands right very difficult work in
the present harvest crops using machines
so work has become what well of course
if you use a machine to do your work
your work has become much what shelter
easier apartments clothing or only well
of course you probably should choose
easier because that's our comparative
right so work has become easier ok you
use machines work has become easy
in the past when people used their hands
okay let's move on in the past people
lived in small houses they lived in
small houses in the present people live
in beep what do people live in now they
live in shelter well small houses is
also shelter apartments clothing or only
apartments of course is our answer here
people live in apartments they still do
live in small houses that's true but
it's more common especially in some
countries to live in apartments more
than just small houses ok over here
women wore dresses in the past women
wore dresses what shelter clothing or
only we saw that before women wore
dresses only the only wore dresses in
the past but now in the present women
wear many colorful and interesting
clothes many colorful and interesting
clothes not just dresses right so that's
a difference these are all differences
what's something similar people need
food beep and beep what do people need
in the past and they need the same thing
in the present well of course we need
food we've always needed food we've
always needed shelter and we've always
needed clothing so these three things
food shelter and clothing have not
changed right people need food shelter
and clothing that hasn't changed from
the past to the present that remains the
same what has changed is how we get
those things or where we get those
things right we've changed the way that
we get our food how we get our food
we've changed some people a lot of
people have changed where they live and
a lot of people have changed what they
wear in fact everybody has changed what
they wear right fashion changes very
quickly so even though we need these
things they still have changed in their
style or their type right but it's true
we still need food shelter and clothing
and that's been true for all of history
ok let's take a look here at the reading
comprehension questions ok we need to
fill in the blanks with these were
it's down here number one beep okay is
something that people wear on their
bodies what do you wear on your body
what do you put on your body to protect
you do you wear shelter well we talked
about that before right that would be
very silly would be very heavy to wear
shelter we wear clothing don't we we
wear clothing is something that people
wear in their bodies we don't wear flour
right unless you're having a fight with
your brother and you throw flour and
then you might be wearing flour on your
head or your or your torso right but
your mom doesn't like that don't wear
flour she'll get very angry you should
wear clothing okay do not wear flour on
your body okay number two crops are
gathered when our crops gathered when do
you gather crops do you gather crops at
an apartment do you gather crops at a
shelter or do you gather crops at
harvest time by the way it's interesting
to notice that can be used for both
place and time it can be used at four
places and time these two are places
aren't they these are places this is a
time it says time right they're time so
we use at four places in time but think
about it
crops are gathered at an apartment do
people grow crops at an apartment that's
silly that's strange of course they
don't do people grow crops at a shelter
a shelter is a type of apartment so no
again you want to do that many people
live in houses they don't grow crops at
their houses right but crops are
gathered at harvest time sure yeah
that's true
crop at the harvest time that's when the
crops are ready the food is ready the
plants are ready to be eaten so people
will gather the crops but it's
interesting to notice that at is used
for both places and time the party is at
my house right or we will gather at 8
o'clock so we use either at with places
and with times but in this case we're
looking for the time
not looking for the place okay let's
move on to number three crops like corn
and wheat corn and wheat are types of
crops what is true about these crops
that's what we're looking for an a B and
C we're looking for a true statement
about these a crop crops like corn and
wheat are grown on farms and are
gathered is that true yeah absolutely
that's true we talked about that where
are crops grown on farms they are
gathered we just talked about harvest
time they are gathered let's look at B
and C for practice B crops like corn and
wheat can only be gathered by hand not
by machines no that doesn't make sense
because we talked about in the modern
times now today we use machines so crops
can absolutely be gathered by machines
crops are grown in shelters that are
gathered crops are not grown in shelters
are grown outdoors right they're not
grown in shelters so again of course we
can see that a is the only correct
answer for this one number four in the
past in the past people lived in small
houses and and but we're looking for a
true statement let's check them out a
and now they only only live in farm
houses do people only live in farm
houses it's true that people do live in
farm houses right now that's true but
not only people live in a lot of
different places Apartments sub suburbs
where there are no farms right they live
in office tells you no they live in many
different types of housing many
different types of shelters not only
farm houses so that's incorrect next one
B and now they also live in apartments
in the past people lived in small houses
and now they also live in apartments so
also means they live in small houses but
also live in apartments is that true
yeah we talked about that in the reading
passage I noted the fact that the word
also means that they still live in small
houses but now
they also live in apartments as well
let's just look at see but people no
longer need to live in shelters that's
not true we need shelters right that's
one of the main things that we were
talking about in the reading passage so
of course that's not correct B is the
only correct answer for this question
okay let's move on to our chart that we
saw before right this is our chart that
shows what has changed in family life
Wow it's a big chart right we've got all
these different things okay so we see
dress t-shirt and jeans farmhouse city
house harvesting by hand harvesting by
machine so what's our first blank here
we can talk about past this is in the
past these are things that are true for
the past how did people dress or where
did they live and how did they gather
their food or how did they get their
food that's in the past what do these
pictures show these pictures show of
course the present all right these
pictures show the present so there's a
difference between the past and the
present in three categories so when
we're talking about dresses we're
talking about t-shirt and jeans these
are coverings that people wear to cover
their body what are we talking about
we're talking about clothing clothing
right over here farmhouse and city
houses these show where people live to
protect themselves from the environment
when we talk about where people live
what are we talking about we're talking
about shelter where do people live where
do they go to live where do they stay
basically if we stay in shelters over
here harvesting by hand harvesting by
machine
what are we harvesting what is this
thing that we are gathering of course
we're talking about food okay so this
fills our chart kind of interesting that
we filled in the categories not the
subjects but then we can go both ways
okay so in the past dresses were
different than in the present clothing
was different in the past shelter was
different than the present and in the
past food the way to get food is
different
was different in the past than it is in
the present so basically this is kind of
a
a very broad or very a unit that covers
a lot of different subjects right
basically we're talking about changes in
family life
we're talking about three main
categories or three main areas how life
our lifestyles have changed from the
past to the present we're talking we
were talked about clothing that women
usually wore dresses but now people wear
t-shirts and jeans we talked about
shelter many people lived in farmhouses
but now we live in city houses and
apartments we talked about how to gather
food before people gathered food by hand
now they use machines to gather their
food and of course that allows people to
live in a lot of different places by the
way we don't just use machines to gather
food a big difference between the
present and the past is we use machines
for almost everything these days and
that has made our life a lot easier not
just food but also for many many
different types of work right so anyway
this unit was kind of interesting
comparing how people lived in the past
to how people live in the present okay
that wraps it up for this lesson we'll
see you guys next time
take care
