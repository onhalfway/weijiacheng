hello everybody welcome back to American
textbook reading I'm Brian Stewart
we're on lesson 8 right now we're
talking about why people or who were the
first people to come to America as you
may know America is kind of a young
nation it's a young country because for
a long long time when other countries
were already established nobody knew
about America only the only were the
only people who knew about America were
of course the Native Americans and
Europeans didn't know about America yet
so who were the people who started
coming to America in this unit you will
discover the first settlers in America
were the pilgrims so we're gonna focus
on this group here the pilgrims who were
the some of the first Europeans to come
to America let's take a look at some
words first of all we need to learn the
word sail to sail means to go or move on
water any boat that moves whether it has
sails or not is sailing on the water
even nowadays boats that have motors and
engines they are also sailing on the
water but that word of course is used
from a long time ago because this these
big pieces of cloth these are sails so
that's where the word came from to sail
to sail across the ocean is to use these
sails to catch the wind and to go across
the ocean to sail ok land land of course
can mean a couple things land is a noun
means you know an area of the earth that
is not water it's a hard surface of the
earth but land is also a verb here land
is used as a verb
it means to so it to arrived that's a
verb not a noun I mean it can be used as
a noun but in this case we're using it
as a verb to land to land means to
arrive somewhere by airplane or boat
because if you think about
if you're on a boat you're on the water
you're on the water you you reach land
you land on land right if you're in an
airplane you're in the air you're not on
land you come back down boom and you
back on land you have landed ok so
that's interesting to land means to
arrive somewhere by boat or by airplane
when you leave the land and you come
back to the land you land ok settler a
settler is a person who goes to live in
a new place a new area before others a
settler is the first person or first
people to go to a new area a new place
for this group and to settle that land
of course settlers European settlers
came to the land they weren't the first
people to live or to make their homes in
America the Native Americans did the
Native Americans settled America a long
long time ago but the Europeans then
came and it was a new area for them so
they were settling the land for
Europeans so it depends on you know who
you're looking from whose perspective
you're looking at as to whether you're
going to use the word settler or not
this is a picture of two people who are
pretending to be settlers I don't think
she's a settler she's a tourist right
who came to look at these people and
she's taking she's participating in one
of the exhibits at like a living museum
ok let's take a look at the next one
which is pilgrim that's the group that
we are talking about in this lesson a
pilgrim you may have heard this word
before a pilgrim is a person in a group
of English newcomers English new comes
the first pilgrims were from England and
they came to America they were on the
Mayflower this is the ship that's the
name of the ship that they were on they
sailed from England to America in 1620
they're called pilgrims pilgrims are
people who seek
religious freedom are there traveling
for religious purposes the pilgrims did
not like the Church of England they
didn't agree with it they wanted to be
free to practice their religion without
the control of the Church of England so
they had to leave England they decided
they're going to go to America from
England they sailed on the Mayflower in
1620 they were some of the first
settlers to come from England to America
and create a town or city the long time
ago 1620 a long time before even America
was a country ok freedom I just
mentioned that the pilgrims
wanted freedom they wanted religious
freedom so they left England freedom is
the right to do whatever you want
freedom is a right to do whatever you
want they wanted religious freedom they
wanted the right to act in their
religion or to practice their religion
in the way they wanted to the Church of
England told them no you can't do that
said no we want freedom so they left
England they were pursuing freedom they
were looking for freedom a route our
route is a way that you get from point A
to point B now your route can be a
straight line or it can be you know if
you have time you want to see some
sights you can go around in a different
way right our route a route is a way
that someone or something takes to go
somewhere so if you're at point a you
want to go to point B there are many
routes you can take you can go this way
and check out a museum if you wanted to
you know I'm just being a little fun
here Museum you can go oh you want to
check out a mountain you can go this way
right there's a mountain we can look at
up this way or you know there's many
routes that you can take between point A
to point B it's a way anyway that you
take that something or someone takes to
get from one place to another place of
course the fastest
root is always a straight line okay
search for if you search for something
it means you try to find that something
you try to find something you're looking
for something you're searching for it
you think it's out there you don't know
you don't know where it is but you're
trying to find it remember be careful
because search for does not mean find if
you find something that's the action ah
you'll get da I found it right I found
it I found it right here it's there then
you find it do not say I am finding my
keys that doesn't make sense because
when you say you find something that's
the moment that you see it aha yo Gaeta
I found it judge si all right I found it
but you do not look around you are not
finding something you are searching for
something be careful I hear a lot of
mistakes a lot of students will say I am
finding my book no you are searching for
your book when you see it then you found
it okay so don't say I am finding
something that sounds silly you are
searching for something okay now let's
take a look at her chart we have the
pilgrims journey we talked about it
already a little bit right we saw on the
word for pilgrim we talked about this
quite a bit actually the pilgrims from
England sailed on the Mayflower in 1620
that's what we saw before okay why did
they do it
the pilgrims wanted freedom of religion
here is England here and they sailed
across the Atlantic Ocean
do-do-do-do-do many months lots of waves
people get sick very difficult to live
on a boat it's always wet the boats
always moving like this sometimes
there's no wind so people are just
sitting around waiting for wind
oh no more no more him they're all but
this is how people traveled a long time
ago it took them many months to come
from England to Plymouth right here in
America on the east coast of America
so from England to Plymouth Plymouth
there's a rock there Plymouth Rock that
they call it's very famous in American
history because that's where the
pilgrims came across the Atlantic Ocean
now let's take a look at a video no this
video isn't actually the way that the
pilgrims sailed this is the landing of
the pilgrims 1620 and you can see the
the Mayflower I'm sure they did not have
these signs and trademark logos on their
boat and look at these guys these guys
are having a good time they're just
laying back you know they're and kind of
lazy but this is not the way it was
absolutely not this is just a fun
cartoon right like I said it was very
difficult to travel for a long time
across such a long distance over the
ocean because think about you're always
moving it makes your head sick it makes
your stomach sick you're moving for
months right the food isn't always so
good especially after you've been on the
ocean for a long time you don't have
fresh food anymore you can't go to the
store to get fresh food you only have
what you brought with you so it's a very
very difficult journey ok let's take a
look at our words and match them to our
definitions the words are sail land
settler settler pilgrim pilgrim freedom
and route route
sounds like the root of a plant right
root okay number one to go or move on
water to go or move on water anytime you
get in a boat and you're moving across
the water what do you call that
of course you call that to sail to sail
number two to arrive somewhere by plane
or boat so you leave land and you return
to land of course land in that case is
uses a noun but we also use it as a verb
that means to land
you're leaving land the noun and you're
you know you're on the water and you're
in the air and you come back to land the
noun you are landing verb to land ok 3
the right to do whatever you want the
right to do whatever you want
you have the right to do whatever it is
that you want to do you have what you
have freedom freedom let freedom ring
right you have freedom to do what you
want to do okay number four a person who
goes to live in a new area before others
so a person who goes to live in a new
area before other people so one of the
first people of a group to go to another
area what do we call these people these
people may be developing a new land they
might be going to live there there's a
large group here some people go in
they're the first people to go and
develop or to make homes in that land we
call those people settlers settlers
number five a way that someone or
something takes to go somewhere so a way
a method a path right not so much a
method but a path the way that somebody
takes a path or a road could be a
different road we call that of course
what do we say we say that's a route
there are many different routes to get
somewhere you can go this way you can go
that way it's a route six a person in a
group of English newcomers to America
who are on the Mayflower in 1620 so it's
a special group not all people who came
to America work in this group but this
is a special group that were called a
certain name because they were seeking
they were looking for they were
searching for religious freedom and what
do we call those people of course we
call them pilgrims they are pilgrims
okay let's take a look at our chart here
the chart here is Thanksgiving Day now
we've talked before about Thanksgiving
Day in the previous book about American
holidays Thanksgiving Day is talking
about holidays in America they're very
important for America and Thanksgiving
Day has to do with the Pilgrims and the
settlers who came to America because
there's a story behind this American
Indians
called Wampanoag Wampanoag helped the
pilgrims when the pilgrims came over
like I said before they were not the
first people in America the Indians had
settled America a long long long time
before the Europeans came over so when
the Europeans came over the pilgrims
came to America
the Indians were already there and the
Indians knew how to live in this land
because they had been living there for
hundreds thousands of years hundreds and
maybe thousands of years not hundreds of
thousands but thousands of years in the
fall the pilgrims had a harvest
celebration with them the pilgrims had a
hard time growing food they didn't know
what kinds of crops to to plant they
didn't know what where to plant they
didn't know how to make crops grow in
the new land especially with the weather
and everything else
the Indians taught them to do that the
Indians taught them where to fish some
better ways to fish how to grow food how
to get their food without the Indians
the pilgrims might have all died they
had a very difficult time so when the
pilgrims in the fall when the pilgrims
got all their food together they had a
harvest celebration with the Indians
they wanted to show the Indians that
they were thankful for the help we
remember that with a holiday called
Thanksgiving Day so our holiday
Thanksgiving Day where we eat a lot of
food and we eat turkey and we have corn
on the cob and biscuits and butter and
cranberry sauce and all those other
things that we eat on Thanksgiving Day
we have Thanksgiving Day to remember
that event when the pilgrims gave thanks
also to the Indians and also to their
God for the fact that they were able to
grow food and be successful in the new
land that they were on ok let's take a
look at our quiz here look at the
picture and fill in the blank to
complete the sentence here we have a
picture here these people are coming off
the boat yay remember it's really tough
on that boat right oh they want to get
back to land
want the world to stop moving around
right so they want to get back to land
they're very happy
they found the new land they can grow
fresh food now they don't have to eat
that old biscuits on the boat okay so in
1620 the BEP sailed from England to
North America on a ship called The
Mayflower who were these people what did
we call that group of people we called
them the pilgrims the pilgrims sailed
from England to North America on a ship
called The Mayflower okay let's take a
look at our true/false questions number
one sail means to move on water sail
means to move on water is that true
absolutely that is true and whenever
you're moving on water you're sailing
well if you're in a boat of course if
you're swimming you're swimming but if
you're in a boat and you're moving on
the water you are sailing to route means
to try to find something so root means
to try to find something does that sound
right that's not right that's false not
root what other word did we learn it
actually it was a two-part word is a
phrasal verb right search for search for
means to try to find something that's
okay but we have to change the sentence
number three the pilgrims wanted the
freedom to grow corn so the pilgrims
didn't like it in a mirror in England
because they couldn't grow corn right
they wanted to go somewhere to grow corn
that's why they left their homes no
that's crazy that's not true that's
false
the pilgrims if they wanted to grow corn
they may have been able to grow corn if
they had corn whether corn is a crop in
in America's but if they wanted to grow
corn they could have done that maybe in
England but that wasn't why they left
England not because they couldn't grow a
certain food the pilgrims wanted the
freedom to practice their religion
practice their recoups practice their
[Music]
religion religion they wanted the
freedom to practice their religion in
the
that they wanted to do not to grow a
certain kind of food okay so we have to
change that that's false
okay so that wraps it up for the
vocabulary section don't go away
well look at the reading passage in just
a few minutes okay welcome back to the
reading section of course we're going
over unit eight we're talking about when
people started coming to America and
we're focusing on the pilgrims as the
first one of the first groups of
Europeans who came to America let's
begin with the reading in the 17th
century the first settlers started
coming to America
one group of the first settlers to land
in America was called the pilgrims so be
careful here the 17th century I may have
pointed this out of course what what was
the year what was the date was at the
1700s now it was the 16 hundreds don't
get confused when you see the 17th
century
always remember minus 1 right and then
you have 1600s in the 1600s the first
settlers the first people the first
Europeans to settle America started
coming to America is especially in the
1620s one group because there were many
groups but one group of the first
settlers to land in America they were
called the pilgrims so it's important to
notice this one group because there were
other groups other groups of settlers
came to different places in America some
of them were successful some of them
failed one group completely disappeared
nobody knows what happened to them so
but one group was called the pilgrims
they were successful they prospered and
they survived okay
the pilgrims they write they refers back
to the pilgrims they were from England
the pilgrims had to sail a difficult
route from England to America over the
Atlantic Ocean they came to America on a
ship called The Mayflower in 1620 so the
pilgrims were from England that's where
they started from the pilgrims had
you had to means they it must they had
no choice they had to do it because that
was the only way to get from England to
America was to sail across the Atlantic
Ocean in a boat sail in a boat it was a
difficult route as I said before it took
many months right it was very hard to be
on a boat especially a small boat like
that with many people for months at end
and sometimes there's no wind so you're
just sitting there mooring right and
there's no fresh food you have to bring
these old biscuits with you that will
stay for a long time the eat all the
fresh food is gone within a week right
then several many many more weeks you
have to eat your food until you get to
America okay so and of course they
sailed across or over the Atlantic Ocean
okay they came to America
on a ship the ship that they were on was
called the Mayflower
when did they come in 1620 that's the
date that they came over they came to
America again they are pilgrims they
came to America searching for freedom
why did they come of religion searching
for freedom of religion the pilgrims
built a village called Plymouth Plymouth
American Indians called Wampanoag
Wampanoag help them grow food and hunt
the pilgrims started a new life in their
new home so let's take a look here again
pilgrims came to America why why did
they come they were searching this is
the reason searching they were searching
for freedom of religion they wanted to
be free in the way that they practiced
their religion they wanted freedom of
religion so the pilgrims built a village
they built a town and they called that
town Plymouth they called it Plymouth
and there was a big rock nearby they
called Plymouth Rock so they said that
the Pilgrims landed at pilgrim Plymouth
rocks are at Plymouth Rock now when they
got there the pilgrims of course were
not the first people in the area
American in
ian's had come a long long time before
them there was a tribe a group of
American Indians their tribes name was
called Wampanoag there were many
American Indian tribes right maybe
you've heard of the Mohicans right the
Apache the Comanche right these are all
different American Indian tribes or
Native Americans who are different
groups or tribes now this group helped
the pilgrims helped the pilgrims them
grow food and hunt because the pilgrims
when they came to the new land they were
not sure about this new land they didn't
know how to live there the Indians were
living there for hundreds and in some
cases for thousands of years before the
Europeans came to America so they knew
the land they knew how to grow food they
knew how to hunt the pilgrims started a
new life in their new home because they
built their new home at Plymouth okay
our reading skill is main idea and
details the main idea is the first
settlers in America were the pilgrims
that's our main idea that's what we're
talking about here we have three details
to support that main idea and we have
three blanks to fill in the words we
need to use our Atlantic Ocean freedom
and Mayflower let's take a look at these
the pilgrims sailed a route from England
to America in the what what did they did
they sail over did they sail over the
Atlantic Ocean did they sail in the
freedom or did they sail in the
Mayflower
they sailed in the Atlantic Ocean the
pilgrims sailed a route from England to
America in the Atlantic Ocean
so the Atlantic Ocean is where they
sailed their route from England to
America they came to America on a ship
on a ship called the what what was the
ship's name of course it was the
Mayflower and when was it in 1620 so
they came to America on a ship called
The Mayflower in 1620 over here the
pilgrims came to America searching for
what were they searching for something
to do with religion they were searching
for freedom freedom of religion that's
why they wanted to come over to America
okay let's take a look at our reading
comprehension questions American Indians
helped the pilgrims do what buy food
grow food or sell food so when the
pilgrims came to America they didn't
have any money right so they couldn't go
to the store and buy food no that's not
right there was no place to buy food
right there weren't any stores at that
time so it wasn't buy food American
Indians helped the pilgrims grow food
right a long time ago if you wanted food
you had to grow it or hunt it but of
course growing food was the best way to
get food enough food for a large group
of people so grow food is the answer not
sell food the Native Americans already
had food the pilgrims didn't have any
food when they got off the boat right
they needed to grow food first
they weren't interested in selling their
food they needed food for themselves to
eat so that's not right B is the right
answer to what is the name of a harvest
celebration
remember that chart we looked at we
talked about the history of a national
holiday of America what is the name of
the celebration that Americans have when
they gather the harvest when they gather
the food in to eat at in the fall and
they wanted to show thanks not only to
the pilgrims I'm not only to the Native
Americans but also to their God for
helping them survive in this new land do
they call it pilgrims day Thanksgiving
Day or Plymouth stay they call it
Thanksgiving Day Thanksgiving Day is the
name of the harvest celebration and we
still celebrate Thanksgiving day every
year it's the fourth Thursday of
November ok let's take a look at number
three how did the Pilgrims come to
America how did they come to America a
they sailed across the Atlantic Ocean B
they walked from England across an ocean
sea they traveled on a ship
called Plymouth well frightened went
away sabe is kind of silly isn't it they
walked from England across an ocean you
can walk on water where they all Jesus
they wanted religious freedom I'm just
kidding now they can't walk on water
nobody can walk on water
so that's silly they didn't walk on
water they traveled on a ship called
Plymouth no the name was the Mayflower
so that's wrong they sailed across the
Atlantic Ocean right that's how they got
from England to America they sailed
across the Atlantic Ocean number four
after arriving in America the pilgrims
did what what did the Pilgrims do after
they arrived in America a showed the
Wampanoag how to grow food in hunt be
built a village called Plymouth and
started their new life or see settled
England by crossing the Atlantic Ocean
sea sounds kind of funny doesn't it
after they arrived in America they
settled England they went back to
England by crossing the Atlantic Ocean
again that's very silly they showed the
Wampanoag how to grow food and hunt no
it was the other way around the
Wampanoag showed them how to grow food
and hunt so that's not right of course B
is our answer they built a village
called Plymouth they called the village
Plymouth and they started their new life
and that's what they did after they
arrived in America okay let's take a
look at our chart here again the
pilgrims journey this chart shows the
journey that the Pilgrims made from
England to America now they started in
one place and they wounded up in another
place in fact I just said what they did
rank you tonight so if we put in this
where did they come from they came from
England where did they land they landed
in Plymouth that's the name of the place
where they landed in America and of
course they crossed the Atlantic Ocean
their ships name was called the
Mayflower so we can see some notes down
here
the pilgrims from England sailed on the
Mayflower in 1620 the pilgrims wanted
freedom of religion and that's the main
reason why the
grams came to America so this unit unit
8 is about people start coming to
America it was about just one group of
people one group of European settlers
who started to come to America to settle
what they thought were new lands of
course the American the Native Americans
had been there for a lot longer and they
didn't really appreciate all these
Europeans coming over that's another
story
anyway the pilgrims came over the
pilgrims were one of the groups that
came over they left England because they
were looking for a religious freedom
they came over on the ship called The
Mayflower in 1620 it's a very difficult
journey they were very happy to land of
course once they once they landed the
Indians helped them and they gave thanks
by having a harvest celebration and
that's why we celebrate Thanksgiving Day
every year in America these days ok well
that's an interesting story a little bit
about history the early early early
history of America and a long time
actually before America became a nation
well anyways hope you've learned a lot
as always we'll see you guys next time
take care
