All things are made of matter.  Matter has three forms.  They are solid, liquid,and gas.  A solid is matter with its own shape. A rock and a book are solids. Even if we move a solid, it keeps its shape. A liquid is matter that flows. Water and oil are liquids.  A liquid does not have its own shape. 
A liquid takes the shape of its container. A gas is matter that does not have its own shape like a liquid. A gas spreads to fill all the space of its container. When you blow up a balloon, the air spreads and fills all the space of it. Matter can change forms. Freeze a liquid and it changes to a solid. If you freeze water, it changes to ice. Melt a solid and it changes to a liquid. An ice cream melts in the hot weather. Boil water and it changes to a vapor . </p>

hello everybody welcome back to American
textbook reading I'm Brian Stuart we're
continuing in our subject of physical
science were on chapter 14 or lesson 14
we're talking about solids liquids and
gas now this is a very interesting
subject when we think about it we're
continuing to talk about matter
remember matter is everything that's
around us
it's interesting to note and we will
discover in this lesson that matter has
three forms there's only three forms for
all the matter we can think of what are
those forms solid liquid and gas right
let's cover those different types of
forms first of all we have solid as I
saw before these of course are marbles
they're probably granite or glass and
these are solid what is a solid a solid
is a form of matter with its own shape
so if a certain type of matter out there
in the world has its own specific shape
it has a shape that is defined it's a
triangle it's a sphere it's a circle or
whatever a sphere by the way that's the
shape here that we see of these marbles
a sphere this is a sphere it's a round
shape but it has three dimensions just
two dimensions would be a circle would
be a circle but anyway of course solids
have three dimensions so we say it's a
sphere solids can be triangular in shape
they can have a shape that we can't
describe right some shapes are very
strange but it has a certain type of
shape and that shape doesn't change that
is a solid okay next we have a liquid a
liquid what how is what is a liquid how
is it different from a solid a liquid is
matter that flows in other words if you
took this glass and you turned it that
liquid would flow out of the glass onto
the table or the ground and it would
spread out it would flow
it would move freely and takes the shape
of its container so this glass which is
a solid right is holding the liquid on
the inside so the liquid takes the shape
of the solid glass shape on the inside
right so that's an interesting feature
about liquid and also liquid will flow
out it gravity will make it flow out
from a high place to a low place so
liquid will always seek the lowest place
it will follow the pressure of gravity
and seek the lowest place in something
and that is a liquid okay
okay and then there's our third form of
matter we talked about solid we talked
about liquid the third form of matter is
a gas what is a gas a gas is a matter a
gaseous matter that changes shape to
fill its container hey wait a minute
that's the same definition as liquid
right but what is unique about gas what
makes gas different from liquid well
when we fill a container with liquid the
liquid is more affected by gravity the
liquid will fill up the bottom part of
the container but if there's not enough
liquid it won't fill up the top part the
top part of that container will be empty
if there's not enough liquid to fill it
however if you fill a container with gas
that gas will fill all of the container
not just the bottom but the top and the
sides too the gas will spread out to all
parts of the container so the pressure
inside this container is the same
anywhere in this container but with a
liquid right if we have a glass and we
have some liquid here the pressure here
is greater than the pressure here see
this is the container right this top
part is not filled by the liquid but in
a container here all of the container is
filled by the gas that's the main
difference between a gas and a liquid
okay let's move on now when we talk
about other ways to describe these
different states we have this word here
vapors an interesting word it's an
interesting state I just used the
example of water right vapor is water in
the air that you can sometimes see vapor
is actually a gas it's a gas that's very
close between the stage of liquid and
gas right it's not a liquid anymore it
is becoming a gas okay we can still see
it right but as you can see gravity
doesn't really affect it vapor the water
vapor is coming up out of the surface of
the liquid of the water also vapor is
what we feel in the summertime when we
feel hot and sticky it's because there's
humidity in the air and that humidity is
water in the air that's water vapor as
well let's take a look at a video
showing us a little bit more information
about vapor as we can see it's very
similar we're boiling eggs these are
eggs in a pot you can see the water I'll
show it to you before I play the video
you can see little bubbles of air this
is gas forming in the water before the
water actually starts to get really
agitated
and that is forming the gas the vapor
that will come off and we can see now we
can see the vapor that's coming off the
surface of the water and that's vapor
okay so it's interesting also to note
we've talked about the three types of
matter solid liquid gas how do they
change right like I can use the example
of water why is water sometimes ice why
is water sometimes liquid and why is
water sometimes heat in this picture you
can see what's the change between water
liquid and water as a vapor it's heat
right if we apply heat to a solid it
will turn into a liquid if we give it
more heat it will turn into a gas so
heat the temperature of something will
make it change the form that it is in
from a solid to a liquid to a gas and
also back the other way if you reduce or
take away the temperature here we have
freeze now I was talking about
temperature right freeze has to do with
very cold temperatures right
if you freeze something you change it
from a liquid to a solid and here's our
example of water again if you take water
liquid water and you take away heat you
lower the temperature what happens it
freezes becomes a solid it is now ice
okay so when you freeze it something it
becomes a solid it goes from a liquid to
a solid so liquid to solid and solid and
freeze means you lower the temperature
of something and so that liquid becomes
a solid okay
when we say it's freezing outside that
means the temperature is so low that
liquid water will turn into ice ooh it's
freezing outside
this is what happens in the winter okay
we talked about a little bit about a
container we talked about liquid will
take the shape of its container a
container of course is something that
you can put things in now sure you could
put solids into this container if we had
those marbles we saw at the beginning in
the spheres the marbles if we put the
marbles in this container the marbles
will still be spheres they won't take
the shape of the container but if we
pour water into the container then the
water will take the shape of that
container and the container is just
something that we can keep things in you
can keep solids you can keep liquids and
you can keep gas in a container too when
scuba divers go underwater they keep
their air in a container it's a scuba
tank on their back right so these are
different types of containers melt now
here's another one we talked about
freeze before right now the opposite of
freeze is to melt if you have ice and
you raise the temperature what happens
to the ice the ice changes from a solid
to a liquid so now we are going from a
solid to a liquid whoops
liquid yeah it's a cue so I have to work
on my handwriting solid goes into a
liquid because we're melting it we're
increase
seeing the temperature of the solid so
that it becomes a liquid this looks like
an ice cream bar melt means to change
from a solid to a liquid an ice cream
bar has to be cold if you leave the ice
cream bar out on a hot sunny day you're
raising the temperature it turns into a
liquid changes from a solid to a liquid
and that's what's going on there so
freeze and melt are opposites okay boil
now here boil is another word that's
similar to freeze and to melt boil when
we're talking about boil we are going
from a liquid now we are going from
liquid to a gas so again we're talking
about heat if we increase the
temperature of something if we give it
Heat
that substance this liquid will
eventually boil boil means to make a
liquid hot so hot that gas forms in the
liquid that liquid the parts of the
liquid become so far apart that they
start to form a gas and the gas will
come off the top of the liquid the
liquid will change into a gas and if you
keep that heat on all of the liquid will
go away it will all be changed into a
gas and you won't have any more liquid
it'll all go away magically is not magic
but it seems like magic because it will
all disappear from the container so
that's is changing a liquid to a gas
so we have freeze we have melt and we
have boil okay now we've talked about
this before flow and basically flow
means for a liquid to move smoothly and
I already talked about this right if you
have a container full of water and you
tip that container over what happens is
the liquid inside the container will
flow smoothly and evenly into another
container or if there's no container
here it'll flow out all over the table
or the floor whatever you're pouring the
liquid onto okay well let's move on to
the next slide okay we have our nice
chart here we have different types of
matter that well we have matter we have
the different forms of matter
remember we're talking about solid
liquid gas this is the coldest this is
the hottest okay in terms of what the
matter is when we talk about a solid we
have a picture in the middle and then we
have the description to describe or give
a definition of what that is so a solid
we can see an apple an apple is a solid
it has its own shape right
it doesn't change shape according to the
container in which its in it has its own
unique shape as solid has its own shape
liquid here we have a pitcher of water
and a liquid does not have its own shape
right it doesn't have its own shape the
picture of glass that is a solid it has
its own shape and what happens is the
liquid is taking the shape of its
container the container is a solid right
so the liquid inside that is taking the
same shape as the container a gas in the
side these balloons is a gas air well
maybe not air a different type of gas
could be for example helium helium is a
very light gas right it will go up
gravity doesn't really affect helium
that will it will just go up into the
atmosphere right
helium also has less pressure than the
surrounding air so that's another reason
why it goes up a gas does not have its
own shape it's also spreads to fill its
container and gas is much lighter than
liquid okay we do have a video about gas
so let's take a look at a short video
and we're going to see how gas takes the
shape of the container in which it is
placed well you have of course here's a
balloon whoa it becomes big because
they're forcing gas into that balloon so
the balloon of course is a shape of a
sphere right now watch what happens
they're letting it out they're letting
that that air out or that gas out and
basically it's just coming out so the
balloon returns to its original shape
right but the gas is pushing out against
a balloon but the balloon shape is a
sphere right so it's filling up that
shape to conform to the solid rubber
balloon okay now let's take a look at
these
words we've just talked about and
matched them to their definitions the
words that we have here solid liquid gas
vapor container freeze these are our
words let's match them to the
definitions the first definition here is
one a form of matter that flows remember
the different forms of matter solid
liquid gas which one of those three
flows very smoothly from one area to
another
if you chose liquid that would be
correct because if you pour water out
from a pitcher it will flow onto the
table or the ground number 2 a form of
matter with its own shape remember
there's only one form of matter with its
own shape it doesn't change right unless
you break it right unless some other
force acts on it but by itself just
sitting there by itself it has its own
shape it doesn't change what form of
matter is that solid liquid or gas it is
of course solid if you chose solid you
would be correct number three a form of
matter that spreads to fill all the
space of its container spreads to fill
all the space now this is an interesting
point between the different forms of
matter we have solid we have liquid we
have gas right now liquid if you pour it
into a container it will fill the bottom
of the container but if it doesn't fill
all the way up to the top then that
space is empty but if you put a gas into
a container it will fill all the space
not just the bottom but also the top
this answer is gas right so gas will
fill all the space of the container
that's what they're talking about here
so if you put that gas as we saw into
the balloon it doesn't just fill the
bottom of the balloon
it fills the top and the sides - it
fills all the space of the container
that would be the gas okay let's move on
to number four number four is to change
from a liquid to a solid do you remember
we talked about that there's some
different words that we describe the
change from one form to another form now
here we have
liquid right we have a liquid and we
want to change it to a solid so do you
remember what we called that what that
process is which one we call it to
freeze so we're freezing we're reducing
the temperature of the liquid it freezes
and it becomes a solid
so if reduce the temperature of water
which is a liquid it freezes becomes ice
which is a solid okay number five water
in the air that you can sometimes see
sometimes you can see it it's a gas
right but it's right after you know when
we're changing liquid to a gas it's
right in between that stage right at
that stage we're changing from liquid to
a gas we saw the video what are we
talking about that what how do we
describe it we call that a vapor vapor
it's when the water is turning into a
gas you can sometimes see it but it's
actually gas gaseous water changing into
from a liquid to a gas
and it's water vapor okay number six
something that you can put things in we
talked about this right we talked about
taking the shape liquid will take the
shape of this if you put liquid into
this thing it will take the shape of its
what container that is correct it will
take the shape of its container
container is something that you can put
things in okay let's move on to our
chart here chart for the chart the title
we have forms of water remember we're
talking about three different forms and
it's not just water it's all matter all
matter has different forms water is just
an easy example because water is very
common and we can see the different
changes of water very easily it's it's
very difficult to see the different
forms of rock for example because for
Rock to become a liquid it has to be
really really hot and that's very very
dangerous but water we can we can see
ice and it's not so dangerous if it's
cold it's just freezing out we drink
liquid water and of course we see water
when it's a gas okay so these are the
three forms of water when it's a solid
it's frozen inside the glass here it's
ice or ice cubes are inside the
the glass here then all the ice melts
and it's just liquid right turns into a
liquid and then it turns into a gas
notice these arrows these arrows are red
for heat these are blue for cold so if
you're going from a solid ice to liquid
you're increasing the temperature the
temperature is getting hotter that's
that's symbolized by red color the by
the red here then we have a liquid here
and if you increase the temperature it
becomes a gas and that also works in the
same way going back this is a cycle this
is a cycle okay if you start with a gas
and you decrease the temperature you
make it colder it turns into a liquid
and then if you make it colder even more
from a liquid it goes back to a solid so
this is a good chart to show not only
the different forms of matter but also
how they change remember how do they
change by temperature changes in the
temperature they become hotter or they
become colder
either way they go both ways okay very
important to take a look at okay
now let's take a look it's kind of like
a little test here we have three
different pictures these are water we're
using water as our example of matter
again we have three different states or
three different forms of water let's
talk about them in the first picture we
have a glass of water now this glass of
water if I take this glass of water and
I pour it out the water will flow evenly
and slow out onto the ground or the
table the water does not fill up the
entire glass there's some space here so
it's not filling the entire shape of the
container what is it is it a solid or is
it a liquid well if you chose liquid
that would be correct because it takes
the shape of its container it doesn't
fill up all of the container and if you
pour it out it will flow out nice and
easy so that's a liquid number two now
we have a combination actually okay but
let's just concentrate on these objects
inside the liquid so this is liquid on
the outside but what are these objects
here this is ice ice has its own
shape right it doesn't flow it doesn't
fill up the entire container if we put
it in a container it keeps its original
shape what do we call that we would call
that a solid okay those are solid solids
have their own shape finally number
three we're not concerned about this
here what we're concerned about is here
this area up here so basically this this
form of water is rising up right it's in
the air we can't see it sometimes you
can see it right if it's just if it's
hot you can see just very traces of it
small little bits of it coming up but
usually we can't see it right and it's
expands if we put this in a container it
would fill up all the parts of the
container not just the bottom of the
container but the top and the sides
everywhere around not just the bottom
what would that be we're talking about a
gas it would be a gas okay let's move on
to our true false questions again we're
going to circle true if the sentence is
true and if the sentence is false we
will circle F number one a solid has its
own shape
is that true or not we just talked about
that sure solids have their own shape
that is true number two gas is a matter
that is solid it doesn't make sense
because we're talking about three forms
of matter it can be a solid it can be a
liquid or it can be a gas but it can't
be both at the same time it can't be a
solid and a liquid at the same time
right so that doesn't make sense gas is
a matter they saw it's a gas and the
solid at the same time no that's
impossible
we say false okay number three if you
freeze water it changes to ice so if you
have a liquid water is a liquid and you
freeze it you reduce the temperature it
becomes ice is that true or not that is
absolutely true so if we reduce the
temperature of water it changes to a
solid form and that is ice okay that
wraps up our vocabulary section and
learning about these ideas and concepts
now we're going to take a short break
come back and take a look at the
don't go away see you soon okay welcome
back let's cover the reading section for
lesson 14 we're talking about three
forms of matter solid liquid and gas our
topic sentence all things are made of
matter matter has three forms so really
our topic sentence is actually over here
matter has three forms this is just a
statement that we already know we
already know that all things are made of
matter our topic sentence really is
matter has three forms that's what our
we're talking about here the three forms
what are the three forms they are solid
liquid and gas so now we're gonna find
out some more details about these three
different forms so we start off with a
solid a solid is matter with its own
shape it has its own shape the shape
doesn't change by itself right if we
come along we knock on it or something
some force is applied to it then it
might change shape but by itself it
won't change shape it has its own shape
for example a rock and a book our solids
a rock has its own shape left by itself
it'll stay the same shape a book has its
own shape if we don't rip it or tear it
or burn it it will retain its own shape
it will keep its own shape even if we
move a solid so we move the rock from
one place to another it's still the same
shape if we take up the book and put it
away in the bookshelf it's still the
same shape it keeps its shape so the
solid will keep its shape okay let's
move on to the second form the second
form is liquid a liquid is matter that
flows right if we pour it out it will
flow to another area water and oil are
liquids oil is also a liquid oil is
heavier than water a liquid does not
have its own shape if we pour water or
juice or oil into this glass it will
take the shape of the glass the glass is
tall and skinny the water or the oil or
the juice will also become tall and
skinny another thing about liquid is it
will only follow it will only fill the
bottom
of its container it won't fill all of
the container it will only fill the
bottom of the container now a gas is a
matter that does not have its own shape
like a liquid liquid and gas are similar
they do not have their own shape a gas
spreads to fill all the space of its
container right when you blow a balloon
the air spreads out and fills all the
space of it it doesn't just fill the
bottom of the balloon it fills all the
space of the balloon and that makes it
different from a liquid because you put
a liquid in the balloon the liquid would
only fill up the bottom part of the
balloon right but a gas fills all the
balloon all the top the bottom the sides
all of the containers all of the the
space inside the container it fills up
it all that's the difference between a
gas and a liquid now matter can change
forms we have three different forms
solid liquid gas but matter can change
forms right if we freeze a liquid it
changes to a solid so freeze a liquid
and it changes to a solid if you freeze
water it changes to ice so this is a
general statement this is an example
freeze a liquid it changes to a solid an
example water if you freeze water it
changes to ice then again we have the
same two sentences same construction
melt a solid and it changes to liquid
example ice cream an ice cream melts in
the hot weather in hot weather so here
we have the same idea boil water and it
changes to a vapor okay well that's a
little bit different boil water it
changes to a vapor so these are the
three different forms or three different
ways that it can change freeze melt and
boil remember freeze means it goes from
liquid to solid melt it goes from solid
to liquid boil it goes from liquid to
gas okay let's take a look at our
reading skill it is the main idea and
the details what's the main idea the
main idea is that matter has three forms
so matter has three forms what are
beep liquid and gas okay can you guess
just by looking at this chart of course
we have liquid gas what's the other one
it's a solid right and of course we got
solid from these words on the bottom
container solid air flows let's use the
rest of these words to fill in the
details about each form over here let's
just practice we see solid solid is a
matte is matter with its own shape so
solid is matter with its own shape that
fits okay then we come over here to
liquid liquid beep it it beep right it
we have something here it does not have
its own shape it takes the shape of its
beep okay so let's see what would be fit
it what would be what could fit into
beat container it container no it's
solid no it air that doesn't make sense
or it flows ah it flows it flows and we
just say that's a complete sentence it
flows we poured out it flows it does not
have its own shape it takes the shape of
its container so the first one will be
flows and the second one will be
container ok so that's what we can say
about liquid moving on the third form
that matter can take is gasps right
gasps gasps remember it's spreads
spreads out to fill the space of its
container all the space not just the
bottom but all the space then we have
beep in a balloon is gas what in a
balloon is gas well if we chose air that
would be correct by the way it's the
only word with a capital at the
beginning so it's a new sentence so we
know that anyway so air in a balloon is
gas Aaron a balloon is gas the air that
we blow inside a balloon is gas or if
you fill a balloon with for example
helium which is another type of gas if
you breathe very funny okay but don't do
that but this is these are types of gas
okay so if we put a gas in a balloon air
in a balloon is gas boat if we put gas
in a balloon it will fill up all that
space inside the balloon okay let's go
over some reading
prehension questions we have our
questions here and we have three answer
choices the first one is what are two
liquids it says what are two liquids so
the answers should have two items each
is that true yeah a water and balloon
that's two things B water and oil that's
two things sea air and ice that's two
things but we're looking for two things
that are both liquids they have to both
be liquids so let's take a look number a
water is water a liquid yes it is is a
balloon a liquid no it's not a balloon
is a solid so a is not correct B water
is water a liquid yeah we just said it
was is oil a liquid yes it is actually
that's the answer B water in oil are two
liquids they are both liquids see Aaron
ice no air is a gas ice is a solid so no
way sea is absolutely not the answer B
is the answer number two if you beep the
liquid turns to a solid so we're talking
about changing from one form to another
what do you have to do to a liquid in
order to turn it into a solid do you
freeze it yes actually you do that's the
answer
you don't melt it remember what when you
melt a liquid can you melt a liquid that
doesn't make sense you melt a solid you
can't not a liquid you melt a solid
solid turns into a liquid so you melt a
solid into a liquid
so obviously B is doesn't make sense see
you blow off a liquid that sounds really
funny it's like like an explosion right
do you blow up a little bit of course
they're talking about blowing up that's
another meaning of blow up but you can't
blow up a liquid that's just silly again
C doesn't make sense only a makes sense
you freeze a liquid it becomes a solid
let's move on to number three if you
boil water the water does what remember
we're talking about a change right so
we're changing from one form to another
water is a liquid if you boil a liquid
what happens to
that liquid will it become vapor which
goes into the air actually that's
correct isn't it
it will become vapor which goes into the
air become like a gas a vapor is a type
of gas B it will melt then freeze into a
vapor that doesn't make sense
boil of course means you increase the
temperature of something right if you
increase the temperature yeah something
will melt but solids melt liquids don't
melt so that doesn't make sense right
there of course and then it will freeze
into a vapor things do not freeze into a
gas things freeze into a solid not into
a guest so this is wrong and this is
wrong this just doesn't make any sense
at all so B is obviously not C let's
just continue for practice though if you
boil wad of water the water will melt
again water doesn't melt so that doesn't
make sense and become ice that's that
just doesn't make sense so obviously a
is the only a correct answer becomes
vapor which goes into the air okay move
on let's move on to number four when you
blow up a balloon you blow air into a
balloon right when you blow up a balloon
the gas the air that you're blowing into
the balloon what happens to it the gas
called oil when you blow up a balloon
are you blowing whale into a balloon no
that doesn't make sense that's silly so
right there we know that a is not
correct right spreads throughout the
balloon but it's not called oil so that
doesn't that's not true that's not
correct the gas what B turns into water
vapor Wow you must have really hot
breath if you can do that right but
anyway we the gas is already a gas right
so how can you turn into a water vapor
that that doesn't make sense right we
turn liquid turns into a water vapor so
it's not gas that's incorrect
so let's take a look at C the gas called
air yes you're blowing a balloon up with
air spreads and fills all the space of
the balloon that's what a gas does right
so that is correct so that is the
correct answer for that one
okay let's move on to our chart we've
seen this chart before
now it's time to test our knowledge test
our memory how can we fill in this chart
what we need to do is fill in the tops
of this chart with the proper name of
the form of the matter we have three
different pictures of different types of
matter here and then we have the
definitions let's look at the first one
this is an apple it is what it is
something that has its own shape
actually the answer is right there right
solid it is a solid a solid has its own
shape okay over here we have what is
this of course you could say it's a
solid but we're talking about this the
form inside the glass picture the glass
pitcher is a solid sure but what's
inside inside we have a liquid right
liquid and what is it about a liquid a
liquid does not have its own shape it
takes the shape of the container so when
you pour a liquid into the solid that
liquid takes the shape of the container
remember it only fills up the bottom not
the whole thing now over here of course
we're talking about a gas that's our
last one left the gas does not have its
own shape that's similar to a liquid
these two things are the same however
what's different is gas spreads to fill
the container liquid does not spread to
fill the container by gas spreads to
fill the entire container and that's the
difference between them so in lesson 14
we were continuing our discussion about
matter and in lesson 14 we learned that
matter has three forms solid liquid gas
and these forms will change depending on
temperature so solid will become a
liquid if it melts if you boil a liquid
it becomes gas right if you reduce the
temperature a gas will become a liquid
or a liquid will freeze into a solid
okay so that's very interesting all
matter has three different forms and we
can change those forms if we raise or
lower the temperature of those forms
well very interesting I hope you've
learned some interesting things in this
lesson and we'll see you in the next one
take care everybody</p></div>
