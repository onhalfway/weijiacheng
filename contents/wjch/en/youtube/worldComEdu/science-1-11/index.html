== Saving Natural Resources ==</p>
<p>The Earth has many natural resources. ut they will not last forever. So it is very important to conserve them. It is a good idea to recycle and reuse resources. It is also important to reduce our trash. When you recycle something, you send an old product to a factory and the factory makes a new product from it. People can make a new plastic object from an old plastic bottle. When you reuse something, you use it again. You can use an old shoebox to plant flowers. You can use plastic bags again when you buy something. You can write on both sides of paper. You can reduce by using less of things. We should reduce plooution too. Pollution can be harmful for the air and water. Reusing, recycling, and reducing will help our Earth. </p>

hello everybody welcome back to American
textbook reading I'm Brian Stewart we're
going over an interesting topic today
we're going over the lesson here saving
Natural Resources so in this this is a
very important lesson isn't it it's very
important to save our natural resources
in this lesson you will discover ways to
conserve natural resources we're going
to go over three main ways to save
natural resources and we could summarize
those by saying the 3 R's what are the 3
R's we can say reduce reduce is one of
our R's recycle is another are and the
third are what would that be reduce
recycle and reuse ok so those are our
three R's those are three important ways
that we can conserve natural resources
conserve means to save for a longer time
let's start with the first one reduce if
you reduce you use less you use less of
something so basically when we talk
about reduce you don't want to use a lot
of something
remember our resources are limited we
don't have a lot of resources and we do
have a lot of resources but there is a
limit on how much there is so we need to
reduce we need to use less of something
what are some examples well in this
picture of course you can see somebody
is turning off the water so water is one
thing that all of us can use less of
turn off the water if you're brushing
your teeth at night or in the morning
don't have the water running the whole
time turn the water on get your
toothbrush wet then turn it off brush
your teeth right then turn it on again
but don't have the water running the
whole time right turn off turn
the water turn off turn off the water
also what is another thing that you can
reduce think about the light overhead if
you're at home and it's night you have
two lights on turn off the electricity
electricity is another thing
electricity is another thing that we can
reduce so there are many things around
us that we can reduce use less of
something turn off the water
turn off the electricity don't keep it
on okay
so this is a very important way to help
conserve our natural resources what's
the second way the second way is to
reuse reuse if you reuse this means that
you use something again what are some
things that you can use again well if we
take a look at this picture we see a
very very interesting thing that you can
put on your desk what is this this looks
like a pencil holder a pencil and pen
holder this is a very useful thing that
you can put on your desk to help
organize your pens your pencils and your
office supplies what's it made out of if
you look at it it looks like paper
that's been folded into shapes so that
you can put your things in this paper
looks like a telephone book I can see
names dot dot dot dot and a telephone
number so this is a telephone book that
maybes too old right they got a new
telephone book what do you do with the
old telephone book throw it away well
you could make a very interesting a
piece of office furniture and you can
use it to store your things so this is
one way that you can reuse things and
you can reuse old books in this case
this would be an old book you can reuse
old books like old telephone books
what's another thing that you can reuse
well of course if you print something
all right people will print something
out you only print on one side of the
paper the other side of the
papers blank use paper again use the
other side of the paper in this case you
can use the back side the back side of
the paper so reuse old books reuse paper
use the back side of the paper if you
reuse the things we have we can use them
for a longer time we can save and not
use so many things right we can save on
the things that we use so this is a very
good idea this is our second way to
reuse okay do you remember the third way
to conserve that's right it's recycle
recycle if you recycle you make
something new from something old so what
does that mean exactly if we see this
cute girl over here right she's carrying
a heavy container and it has things
inside that she is going to recycle what
are those things we can see plastic
bottles we can see cardboard in the
background so what are some things that
we can recycle well one of the things of
course is plastic we can recycle plastic
okay
we can recycle paper and cardboard
cardboard of course is a type of paper
that's been pressed so paper cardboard
cardboard is paper that we press
together and it into like a box like
this one right here so plastic paper
cardboard what's another thing we can
recycle of course cans so when you throw
out your trash remember to recycle these
things remember to separate those things
so we will separate separate these items
so that the plastic is here cardboard is
here cans are here that way the garbage
man the garbage person who comes and
takes the garbage will take the plastic
and they will use that plastic to make
something new they'll use the paper to
make new paper or cardboard they'll use
the cans to make new cans so to recycle
is to make something new from something
old okay so it's a very good thing we
have a video to watch about recycle
let's take a look see what's going on
here the teacher is teaching her
students how to recycle let's take a
look so what she is saying she has her
things up here she has her items on the
board and she's talking about reduce
recycle and reuse I think is what's
there and of course that's exactly what
we're talking about - and she has a blue
bin a blue bin a blue container here for
things that you put inside there to
recycle of course the things that she's
going to put in the blue bin are the
things we just talked about plastic
paper cans are your most common things
that we can recycle we can reuse those
things we can use the old packaging and
make something new from them okay let's
move on here there are a couple of other
words we're gonna go over now when we're
talking about saving Natural Resources
one thing we want to avoid is pollution
if we don't recycle our things are old
things what happens we have to put them
somewhere we have to put them in the
land that causes land pollution right
pollution is harmful materials in the
environment so if you have a lot of old
rusting cans out in the ground that's
harmful and it doesn't look good either
there are basically three types of
pollution really there is air pollution
air pollution right air pollution we
also have another type of pollution that
is water pollution water pollution and
we also have land pollution these are
three major types of pollution if we
burn things the smoke goes into the air
that causes air pollution if we spill
chemicals into the water if we throw
chemicals into the water we can't drink
that water it makes it dirty
that's water pollution and if we throw
away our cans and our plastic bottles on
the
and we don't care about that that's land
pollution we have to avoid pollution
because pollution is harmful it's not
good for us it's harmful materials in
the environment let's take a look at
some pollution here this is terrible
isn't it if you look at this this is
this is really bad here we have the
ocean here which should be a very
beautiful place in nature look at that
that's horrible
people have just come here and they've
dumped their trash they dumped their
trash on the beach we have plastic
bottles we have this looks like an oil
bottle so maybe there's some liquid
pollution here some water pollution we
have old pieces of wood some cans laying
around some pieces of glass this is very
dangerous you wouldn't want to go to
this beach this is horrible this is
terrible not just for people but also
for the animals that live in this area
pollution is very bad we need to avoid
this by reducing reusing and recycling
okay so this is what we want to avoid
okay one of the ways we can avoid
pollution of course is to conserve if we
don't use as much as as much of whatever
we're using if we reduce our use that is
conserved conserved means to use
carefully and without waste actually
conserve is very similar to reduce isn't
it conserve and reduce are very similar
words but we see conserve a lot when
we're talking about the environment to
conserve our resources means to reduce
don't use so much right use carefully
don't waste our resources so turn down
the temperature on your heating or your
air-conditioning if it's too hot right
just open a window don't wear a sweater
right take the sweater off in the
wintertime if it's too cold instead of
turning up the heat put on a sweater put
on a jacket okay save or conserve the
amount of energy that you use conserve
our natural resources
don't use
as much of something okay it's very
similar to reduce now before we saw the
beach right we saw a lot of garbage we
saw a lot of pollution on the beach this
of course is what we can call trash
trash is things that people throw away
because they don't need them there is a
lot of different words that mean the
same as trash right I just used one
before just before I just said garbage
garbage is one word that also means
trash trash is another word for rubbish
so we have another word here there's
lots of different words that mean the
same thing these are things you don't
need so trash is something you do not
need if we don't need it our natural
tendency is to throw it away throw it
away but be careful maybe we could reuse
it right so we want to reduce the amount
of trash we make we don't want big piles
of trash out in the in the land this is
land pollution right so we want to
reduce the trash trash is also garbage
trash can also be called rubbish trash
garbage rubbish okay by the way your mom
might use a very common expression to
you using trash she might say take out
take out the trash take out the trash
okay that means it's your duty take out
the trash when you take out the trash
remember to recycle the plastic the cans
and the paper separate those things take
out the trash take it out of your home
that's a chore you may have to do at
home mom will ask you to do that
okay let's move on here we've talked
about this before plastic plastic is one
of the things that we can recycle what
is plastic plastic is a light strong
material made by people it's light means
you can pick it up easily it's not heavy
so it's very convenient to make it for
our packaging plastic is used in
packaging it's a very convenient
material to use for
packaging we package things inside of
plastic in this case looks like
detergent liquid soap liquid detergent
but you can also see plastic if you go
buy some cookies right it probably comes
in a plastic container the tray there
the cookies are in that's also made of
plastic plastic is very useful people
can make many different shapes out of
plastic you can make so many shapes
using plastic it's a very convenient
material however the problem is that
plastic if we throw it away it stays in
the land for a very long time so we need
to recycle it or we need to reuse it
okay so this is plastic
now Factory of course we've talked about
recycling when when we talk about
recycling with those materials usually
go to a factory but of course a factory
is a building where things are made
right so if we recycle our cans those
cans will go to a factory they'll melt
the cans down and they'll make new cans
from them the same thing with plastic
okay
so a factory is a building where they
can make many different things and we
need those things to live our daily
lives the thing is we need to be careful
in our use of those things so a factory
is a building where things are made okay
we have a nice chart here how can we
save natural resources we talked about
the 3 R's and that's what we have here
reuse recycle
reduce the three ways that we can save
natural resources so we have these ways
here we have pictures showing each way
in the middle and on the bottom we have
the definition of these different ways
let's start over here with reuse reuse
of course means to use things again in a
new way and we see three office workers
here and they have a lot of old
computers with them now as you know
computers get old very quickly don't
they you probably don't use the same
computer for more than five years after
five years usually the computer might be
too old or the software is no good
anymore so you might want to throw that
computer away but should you throw the
computer away
and it goes into the trash and creates
more land pollution no don't do that you
can still use parts of the computer you
can use the keyboards you can use the
fans you can use the inside parts of the
computer and you can even use them for a
new computer also you can donate your
old computer to another organization
that might need old computers so don't
throw those computers away figure out
how can you reuse them and it's not just
computers it's anything
how can you reuse the things that you
use in a new and interesting way the
second we have recycle we have a boy
girl and a girl here they're separating
the garbage
what does recycle mean make a new thing
from an old thing so what they're going
to do is they're going to make this boys
throwing paper away they'll make new
paper from that they'll put go to the
factory and make new paper same thing
with the glass by the way glass is
another thing that we recycle a lot so
besides our paper besides plastic
besides cans we also have a fourth thing
that's very common glass and that's what
this girl here is throwing away or
they're separating the garbage she's
putting the glass in the green bin okay
our third way to save our natural
resources is reduce use less of
something remember reduce is very
similar to conserve you're not going to
use a lot of things you're not going to
waste things don't waste these things so
turn off the water while you brush your
teeth you remember example that we
talked about before when you brush your
teeth get the toothbrush wet turn off
the water right then brush your teeth
then turn the water back off back on
again rinse your toothbrush rinse your
mouth but don't keep the water running
same thing with the electricity right
use less water use less electricity
don't waste water is another way to say
it
don't waste don't waste dot dot dot dot
dot don't waste water
don't waste electricity don't waste
Natural Resources okay let's move on
we're going to match each
word with its definition so we're going
to talk about these words here these are
our words reduce recycle pollution trash
reuse and conserve and these are our
definitions so let's match these
definitions to the proper word number
one to make something new from something
old do you remember that's one of our 3
R's so you have an old thing and you you
don't throw it away but you use it again
to make something new of course that is
called recycle that's one of our three
RS to recycle what do we recycle paper
glass cans plastic those are things that
we recycle number two to use something
again so to use something again what
would we use well of course our clue
here is use we also have use up here
right so to reuse you use it again right
of course by the way again means re in
many words reuse use again to use less
of something to use less of something
that means to reduce right we use less
of something it's very similar to the
word conserve we don't waste whatever
the resource is we don't waste
electricity we reduce our use of
electricity so we reduce our use of
something ok let's move on to four five
and six for something you do not need
something you don't need so you might
throw it away and your mom will probably
tell you take it out right do you
remember we talked about trash remember
there's a lot of different words for
trash trash rubbish garbage these words
are all used very commonly to mean the
same thing garbage rubbish and trash
okay something you don't need something
you throw away number five
harmful materials in the environment
remember we talked about three main
types of this air water and land what
are we talking about harmful materials
in the environment we're talking about
pollution pollution is something we want
to avoid right number six to use
carefully and with
waste this word is very similar to
reduce it is of course conserve so when
we conserve things we don't waste them
we use less of them we be very careful
about how we use them and that is to
conserve to use carefully and without
waste we don't waste the resources we
should conserve our resources these are
very important are words when we're
talking about how to protect our natural
resources okay here we have another good
chart saving resources at home we've
talked a little bit about these subjects
one way of course turn off the water
when you don't need it if you're washing
your hands and you know you get the soap
you can you can put the soap on your
hands without running the water right so
make sure you don't waste water at home
whenever you're not actually using the
water turn it off right don't keep the
water flowing the whole time when you
take a shower don't spend a lot of time
in the shower clean yourself off then
get out of the shower right when you
brush your teeth turn off the water when
you're actually brushing your teeth you
don't need it think more about water and
how you use it because water is a
precious natural resource another way
that we talked about turn off the lights
when you leave a room we can see this
very common turn off the water
turn off the lights so turn off means to
stop using it right cut the supply so
you turn off the lights when you leave a
room at home we get lazy right we leave
a room we don't think we leave the light
on we go into another room read a book
and then with all the lights still on in
the other room that's wasting
electricity nobody's in that room so if
you leave a room turn the light off
right don't leave the light on for
nobody right only leave the light on if
somebody is in the room and they need
the light so turn off the lights when
you leave our room
the third way we can do we can save
resources at home this is a nice picture
family playing chess they have a fire in
the background turn down the heat and
put on a sweater see
it looks like it's cold it's probably
wintertime but they're not sitting
around in t-shirts and shorts right
they have warm clothing on so they have
sweaters on that's important so that way
they don't have to make it so hot in
their home they can conserve or reduce
the amount of heat they're using in
their home so this one they say turn
down it doesn't mean turn off the heat
because that's too cold just turn the
heat down right so you don't use as much
heat same thing in the wintertime you
can say turn down the air conditioner it
doesn't have to be so cold right turn
down the air conditioner and maybe take
off your coat take off your sweater or
wear some are closed so you're not so
hot okay here we have another chart here
we have a little a bit of a review here
we need to write the way of saving a
resource for each picture so each
picture shows a different way one of the
three r's that we talked about now these
are some very interesting ways that we
can use the 3 R's
reuse reduce recycle which one can we
match to which picture in the first
picture we can see a bin it says plastic
on it in the bin there are many plastic
bottles and containers and a plastic bag
over here so what is the person doing
here what do we call what which of the 3
R's does this go with of course we're
going to use that plastic again we're
gonna use something old to make
something new and that of course is what
the definition of recycle is in the
second picture look at this is it very
interesting this is a swing right what
is the swing made out of what are these
kids sitting on they're sitting on an
old tire right so this tire used to be
on a car now the tire got old it's no
good anymore should we throw it away and
create land pollution no one way we
could reuse this tire is to make a swing
out of it right I just gave you the
answer we're going to reuse this tire to
make a swing for something that kids can
play on so that's one way that we can
reuse something that
we normally think of as trash it's not
trash we can reuse it
finally over here what's this person
doing there turning off the water
because they don't need it right now
so when you use less of something when
you use less of something what are you
doing you are reducing your use of that
resource reduce the use of water reduce
the use of electricity reduce so again
we have our 3 R's recycle reuse reduce
those are three important ways that we
can save our environment save our
natural resources okay here we have
again our true or false questions if the
sentence is correct circle true if the
sentence is false circle F 1 if you
reuse you use less of something so this
is talking again about the 3 R's and the
definition does reuse mean that you use
less of something is that true no that's
not true right remember it's not reuse
that would be reduce right if you reduce
you use less of some that's true but not
reuse so that's false right because it's
the wrong word it's the wrong word
number to conserve means to waste
something is that right we talked about
remember I told you guys don't waste
don't waste something don't use it
unnecessarily save it right try to save
it for a later use
conserve means to save something not to
waste something it's the opposite right
conserve means to save something not
waste so again this one is false okay
number three recycle means to make
something new from something old so for
example you have an old plastic bottle
you're gonna send it away
they're gonna make a plastic bag out of
that is that true that is absolutely
true
recycle does mean to make something new
from something old okay well that about
wraps it up here we're gonna take a
short break
next we'll come back and we'll take a
look at the reading passage see you soon
okay welcome back kids we're gonna go
over the reading passage now the reading
passage is talking about the words and
the concepts and the ideas that we just
studied as part of lesson 11 here we
have the first sentence the earth has
many natural resources so that's the
main idea right the earth has many
natural resources but very important but
here but they will not last forever
so sure we have many natural resources
there are many we have a lot of natural
resources however but the important
point they will not last forever
they are limited we don't have an
unlimited supply of oil an unlimited
supply of clean water right so we have
to be careful about how we use these
resources that's why it says so so
therefore therefore it is very important
to conserve them to conserve them to
save them to try to reduce our use of
them it is a good idea to recycle and
reuse resources right remember our 3 R's
it is also important to reduce our trash
recycle reuse reduce and of course we
have our word over here trash are
rubbish things we don't need so we
should recycle we should reuse we should
reduce our trash ok and our resources ok
moving on when you recycle something you
send an old product to a factory
remember the factory is the building
where things are made and the factory
makes a new product from it so you send
it your cans to the factory the factory
melts those cans down and makes new cans
from those old products right now this
is one way that we can recycle another
way people can make a new plastic object
from an old plastic bottle this is
another way you can recycle so there's
two ways that this paragraph is talking
about the two main ways are two main
types of recycling right one is done by
a factory one is done by individual
people so we can all there's two
different ways mainly that they're
talking about this passage how to
recycle okay moving on to our second R
here when you reuse something you use it
again now that's a good general
statement we're talking about reuse we
give the definition what are some
examples of that we see we you can use
an old shoebox to plant flowers so we're
saying what reuse is we say what the
definition now in writing when you write
a general sentence like this one right
give some specific examples we have some
examples use an old shoebox to plant
flowers and that's a good idea isn't it
when you get your new shoes you get the
box that the shoes came in you can put
dirt in it grow some flowers put it by
your window so use an old shoebox to
plant flowers you're reusing something
good example another example you can use
plastic bags again when you buy
something don't throw those plastic bags
away reuse them use them again another
way you can write on both sides of the
paper before I talked about that right
that's one way that you can reuse
something when you print a piece of
paper out on the back side it's blank
there's nothing there use it reuse that
paper so actually we have one two three
right three ways for reusing so this is
a very good organization for our
paragraph we have the general statement
reuse something example1 example2
example3 so we have support for our
general statement okay so it's very good
organization okay so let's move on to
the next R and that is reduce write
reduce you can reduce by using less of
things you can reduce your use of water
or electricity for example you could
also reduce pollution too so we can
reduce by using less of things we don't
have examples here but we do have
support here we can reduce pollution not
just water in electricity but we can
also reduce the pollution right we don't
throw things away
we recycle things
that means we reduce the amount of
pollution we're putting into the
environment because pollution can be
harmful for the air and water so to sum
up in conclusion reusing recycling
reducing will help our earth so this is
a good concluding statement right here
reusing recycling and reducing will help
our earth ok so let's go over this
passage again let's talk about our
reading skill our reading skill is main
idea and details what was the main idea
of the passage the main idea was there
are ways to conserve natural resources
there's lots of different ways that we
can conserve our natural resources those
three ways again they talk about the 3
R's here we have the 3 R's two of them
we see in our chart one of them is
missing so we have to match it to the
supporting details or to the definition
of what these are so the first one we
don't have the the word right it should
be down here in our word box again less
recycle this is the definition here
actually it's very easy right because
it's the 3 R's we can see only one word
starts with R and of course that will be
recycled but let's go over the
definition recycle means to make
something new from something old is that
true absolutely that's true you take
something old and you make something new
from that that is the definition of
recycle second we have reused to use
again to use something again right and I
just said that reuse again to use again
reuse to use something again the last
one here reduce reduce means to use less
of something right to use less of
something so you want to reduce
something you want to reuse less of that
in the examples of course we talked
about very common use less water use
less electricity don't use so much of
that ok let's do some reading
comprehension questions here first of
all we have choose a correct answer for
number one what is a place where things
are made remember we talked about that
building where
things are made especially when we're
talking about recycling
we send our old plastic to this building
we send our old metal cans to this
building they make something new from
those things what kind of building is
that is it a shoe box a bottle no it's a
factory right
it's a factories a building they don't
make new things in a shoe box
and they don't make new things in a
bottle right they make new things in a
factory number 2 pollution can be
harmful to the beep what is beep right a
factories in trash be bottles in plastic
sea air and water so pollution can be
harmful to factories and trash that
doesn't make sense
trash is a type of pollution so how can
pollution be harmful to pollution that
doesn't make sense be bottles and
plastic these are types these could be
pollution bottles in plastic if you
throw them away on the ground and you
you don't care about them then that's
pollution so again it's kind of the same
thing pollution is not harmful to
bottles in plastic right that doesn't
make sense what about sea air and water
remember we talked about three types of
pollution right air pollution water
pollution land pollution so pollution
can be harmful to the air and water
absolutely and also we can say land as
well pollution can be harmful to the air
water land we can also say pollution can
be harmful to the environment and that
is basically the environment the
environment is air water and land
environment
okay so pollution can be harmful to the
environment pollution can be harmful to
our world our earth our environment so
Aaron water is part of the environment
let's move on to number three you can
help conserve Earth's natural resources
how this is interesting you can help do
this how when we talk about how we use
bye-bye-bye when we use bi we use ing
ing ing by doing something what can we
do how can we help conserve
Earth's natural resources by verb ing
something by doing something our three
choices are by only buying new things
made in a factory by reducing how much
you recycle and see by reusing things
like shoe boxes and plastic bags how can
you help conserve Earth's natural
resources if you only buy new things
made in a factory you're only buying new
things you don't reuse mm-hmm so you're
not using old things again that's not
that's not a way to conserve natural
resources because in that case you're
not reusing if you only buy new things
use the old things that you have so a is
not correct answer how about me by
reducing how much you recycle does that
now see they're trying to trick you here
right because we have reduce and recycle
oh those are two of the three hours but
think about this this is a little bit of
a trick if you reduce how much you
recycle that means you don't recycle as
much right instead of recycling your
plastic bottles instead throw them away
but that's not good for the environment
right you can't conserve Earth's natural
resources by reducing the amount of
things you recycle that doesn't make
sense right so again B is not the right
answer how about C by reusing things
like shoe boxes and plastic bags well of
course that's one of the 3 R's we talked
about if you reuse old things then you
can help conserve Earth's natural
resources so C is our answer okay number
four that was kind of tricky though
number three wasn't that B that was very
tricky what they tried to do there hey
let's move on to number four plastic
bags can be made by how can we make
plastic bags a B or C recycling plastic
bottles or other plastic objects be
reusing shoeboxes and plastic bottles C
conserving our trash plastic bottles and
plants how can we make but this this is
a key point here being made by let's
take a look at a recycling plastic
bottles or other plastic objects
sure remember recycling means to use to
take something old and make something
new out of it
plastic bags can be made by old plastic
bottles or other plastic objects sure
that's true a is our right answer let's
just look at B and C for practice
reusing shoe boxes and plastic bottles
if we reuse the shoebox or we reuse the
plastic bottle we can't make plastic
bags out of shoeboxes there's no way we
could do that and individually we can't
do it if we reuse plastic bottles
they're just reusing plastic bottles no
that means you're not making a plastic
bag out of it you're just reusing the
old bottle that doesn't that doesn't fit
see conserving our trash if we just
conserve the trash right if we don't
throw away as many things we're not
making something new the only way we're
gonna make something new is by taking
something old making something new out
of it
that's a ok let's move on then here we
have our chart here we saw this chart
before now it's time to remember see how
well we remember to put in the 3 R's
according to the different pictures and
the definitions first we have the
picture here remember the office workers
they have old computer things that
they're going they're not going to throw
away they're going to try to figure out
new ways to use it using things in a new
way
that of course is reuse okay our second
R is over here we have three kids
they're separating their garbage they're
putting plaster glass and plastic into
different bins because they're going to
make a new thing from an old thing these
things are going to be sent to the
factory and they're going to be used to
make new things so when you make a new
thing from an old thing what are you
doing you are recycling to recycle
finally don't use so much of something
right don't use less of use less water
use less electricity that of course is
to reduce reduce the amount of things
that you use okay so this again just to
wrap up reuse recycle reduce remember
these things these are very three these
are three very important ways to save
our natural resources okay well that was
a that was a good lesson very important
lesson hope you've learned
as usual we'll see you again next time
take care everybody</p></div>
