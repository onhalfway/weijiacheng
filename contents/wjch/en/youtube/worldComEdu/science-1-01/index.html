[Parts of Plants]
There are many different parts of plants. The parts help a plant to grow. The roots
of a plant take in water and hold the plant in the ground. The stem carries food and
water through the plant and holds up the plant. The leaves of a plant take in air and
light for the plant. The flowers of plants make fruit. Flowers are very beautiful.
People can eat the fruit. The fruit holds seeds. Oranges, apples, lemons, and bananas are delicious fruit. Trees are very big plants. Trees have branches. Branches are the arms of a tree and have leaves.</p>

hello students my name is Brian Stuart
I will be your teacher for today today
we are going over part 1 in our textbook
life science and specifically we'll be
talking about the parts of plants if you
think about it plants are all around us
aren't they we use plants for many
things we use plants for food we use
plants for shelter right our house is
made of parts of plants plants even make
the air that we breathe so we can see
plants are all around us and they are
very useful today we will discover two
things in our lesson the first is the
parts of a plant right here's a nice
picture of a plant we can see that there
are different parts to this plant we're
going to talk about those different
parts the second thing you will discover
in this lesson is how a plant's parts
help it to live and grow so how did
these parts of the plant help it grow
into very big a plant or a very good
plant a mature plant that we can use
well let's we're gonna find out these
two things in this lesson so let's get
started
here we have a plant these are types of
plants of course perhaps in your garden
perhaps your mother has a garden she has
these kinds of plants a plant what is a
plant exactly a plant is a living thing
that grows in the ground okay we are
living things to human beings and
animals but we don't live in the ground
right plants can't move they are stuck
in the ground so plants grow in the
ground they need our it a plant needs
air water and sunlight so there are
three things that
plant needs to grow and those of course
are air water and sunlight so how does a
plant get these things in this lesson
we'll talk about the different parts of
the plant that help the plant get air
water and sunlight
okay moving on here we have the root
this is the part of the plant that you
normally you don't see it's in the
ground in the previous picture
we only saw this part of the plant here
right but we didn't see this part this
part are the roots and these are typical
looking roots for a plant they have many
different parts or many different like
arms going into the ground what does the
root do for the plant the roots of a
plant take in take in water and hold the
plant in the soil before we saw that a
plant needs air water and sunlight to
grow so the roots are the part of the
plant that helps the plant take in water
okay and also the second thing that the
roots do is they hold the plant in the
soil so these roots are like strong legs
right but in the ground so the plant is
does not fall over if there's a strong
wind it stays sturdy and strong and for
a tree for example that's very heavy
that's very important right so roots
help the plant stay strong in the soil
okay let's move on let's talk about the
next part of the plant which is the stem
ok we've started to the bottom the roots
we can't see but now we're coming up and
we can see the stem is here what does
the stem do for the plant a stem carries
food and water so carries food and water
through the plant so the roots down here
they're taking in water they're also
taking in food from the from the dirt
from the soil and the stem carries that
food up right to the leaves
okay through the plant it holds up the
plant so the stem is like the trunk of
your body right it is the main part of
the plant in in many plants but it's
like the structure of the plant and it
holds the plant above the soil and we
call that this stem okay let's move on
here we have a leaf these are the top
parts of the plant you see these big
green things most plants have these what
are they of course they're the leaf now
be careful
leaf is singular one one leaf but of
course plants have many many leaves so
if we talk about singular leaf or plural
leaves leaves okay so here we have leaf
and what does the leaf do a leaf takes
in again we have that verb right takes
in it takes in light and air so it takes
in light and air two things that the
leaf does for the plant it takes in
these things that help the plant grow
leaves help the plant get food so we can
see that the plant gets food basically
from two parts we've talked about
already the first part we talked about
were the roots right the roots take in
water and some food from the from the
soil also leaves take in air and
sunlight and those are the things that
help the plant grow to be a bigger plant
okay let's move on to the next slide
some plants are very beautiful aren't
they in the springtime you can see many
different colors and these colors are
made by flowers so many plants and trees
which reads our plants of course have
flowers and the flowers can be many
different colors very beautiful what do
flowers do for the plant plants have
flowers flowers make fruit well that's
what they do for us right because we eat
the fruit but what does the
froot do for the plant we'll find out
soon flowers are very beautiful
as I've said right well what is it about
flowers and fruit that is good for the
plant okay well these flowers they
produce fruit now here we see an example
of fruit these look delicious don't they
fruit of course is good for us it's part
of the plant that we eat some plants
these of course look like oranges there
are many different kinds of fruit fruit
is the part of plant with seeds here we
have seeds we'll talk about later what
seeds do for the plant apples and lemons
are common types of fruit so if you cut
open an apple I'm sure you like apples
right apples are very delicious and
they're good for you too you should eat
lots of apples but if you cut open an
apple you will see seeds inside the
apple if you open a lemon be careful
when you eat a lemon it's sour right but
you also have to watch out for the seeds
in the lemon okay
so plants will also produce fruit okay
let's move on
what is another part of the plant
especially on trees right not so much
small plant but for big trees we can see
branch a branch plural branches a tree
has many different branches so you can
climb a tree right when you want to
climb a tree if it has a lot of branches
it's a good climbing tree but be careful
when you climb a tree okay be very
careful okay
a branch is an arm like a part of a tree
so if you look at me I've got two arms
it's like I have two branches right but
a tree of course has many different
branches and these of course support the
leaves where the tree takes in air and
sunlight as we saw before okay let's
move on here now we're ready for a
little review this is a picture we have
a nice picture of a plant here it's a
small plant it's a beautiful plant why
is it beautiful what are the parts of
the plant let's review the beautiful
part of this plant what do we call this
part of the plan
can you remember okay you got it did you
guess
flower yes that would be correct this
top part of the plant here the beautiful
bright colorful part of the plant is the
flower okay so let's move on here what
would this part be here this is the part
that holds up the plant okay what do we
call that we call that the stem okay
this is the part that supports the rest
of the plant now let's move on here we
see this green thing here remember this
green thing we say it two ways one for
singular one for plural what do we call
that again do you remember yes you got
it leaf and remember the plural leaves
leaves okay let's move on to the last
part of the plant that we have pictured
here this part is the part that holds it
in the ground it's the part that takes
in water and some food from the ground
do you remember what we call the what we
call this part that's right this part is
called the roots of a plant okay do you
know this is just one type of roots of a
plant this is kind of a typical plant
but you know there are many different
kinds of plants and different kinds of
plants have different looking parts
let's look at a video with a very
different looking type of root do you
can you guess what it is well let's take
a look at the video okay look at this it
looks like it's a little windy do you
see this plant here do you know what
this is we take this part of course this
is a carrot right and did you know that
the carrot is actually the root of the
plant there are many types of plants
where we actually eat the root we don't
eat the stem or the leaves we eat the
root so you can see we're taking the the
plants the carrot plant out of the
ground and putting them in the box and
in the Box the stem and the leaves have
been cut off and then the carrots they
come to your dinner table by the way
carrots are very good for you right so
you should eat lots of carrots and other
types of vegetables
and many types of vegetables are
actually grown inside the ground and we
take them out and we eat the root of the
plant okay it's time for a little review
now let's go over the words that we've
discussed so far in this lesson we can
see the root the words that we are
looking at our root stem flower plant
leaf and fruit all of these words are
what they are parts of a plant right all
of these words are different parts of a
plant so how can we describe these words
the first question is the part that
takes in light and air for the plant
that's important the part that takes in
lights and air for the plant which part
of the plant did we talk about where the
part of the plant it takes in light and
air two important things for the plant
to grow which part does that okay if you
guessed if you guess the leaf you are
correct
of course it must be the leaf right it's
not the roots the roots are underground
they can't take in light there's no
light underground so it has to be the
leaf right okay that's the first one the
second one again we're talking about a
part of the plant the second one the
part that takes in water for the plant
remember we talked about that that part
is underground what part do you remember
do you remember what part that was that
part of course is the roots the root of
the plants okay okay so let's move on to
number three the part of the plant with
seeds what part of the plant has seeds
give you a clue it's also the part of
the plant that we eat it's very
delicious
of course we eat roots but this part of
the plant is sometimes more tasty more
delicious than the roots
do you remember what part that is that's
right it's fruit so it's true apples and
oranges are usually more delicious
then carrots or onions for example of
course they're all good for you but uh
fruit is a part of the plant with the
seeds okay let's move on to the next
three questions number four is the part
of the plant that carries food and water
to the plants so think about that you
have the roots underground you have the
leaves up top what part of the plant
carries that food up from the ground can
you remember that that part of course is
the stem it's also the part that
supports the plant that makes the plant
stand up straight and tall and hopefully
strong if it's a if it's a strong stem
okay number five the part that makes
fruit and is very beautiful right before
fruit comes out on the plant what is
there on the plant and remember it's
very beautiful in the spring you can see
many beautiful colors because of these
and of course this part of the plant is
called the flower the flower is the part
of the plant that where that makes fruit
and that is very beautiful okay we're on
our final word here number six is a
living thing that grows in the ground
okay this is the only word actually that
is not part of a plant it's it's the
whole thing right and that of course is
the plant a living thing that grows in
the ground is of course a plant we human
beings and animals are also living
things but we do not live in the ground
right only plants live in the ground
they don't move okay well let's talk now
about the use of plant parts we talked
about so far about the many different
parts of a plant now let's talk about
how we use these parts of the plants
plant parts we've talked about these
stem roots leaves and flower okay these
are all plant parts on the bottom row
here we have things made from plant
parts so what kinds of things do we make
the plants that we use in our everyday
life that's what this chart shows as you
can see here we have the stem of a tree
okay it's a very strong very big stem of
course this is wood right we use that to
make wood and what do we use wood for we
use wood to build a house so before when
I said we use plants for shelter well
that's exactly what I was talking about
we use trees to build ourselves shelter
or a house so that we can live in we can
protect ourselves from the wind and the
cold
that's our shelter did you know that we
use some roots to make sugar hmm that's
good right so some some plants that we
use the roots of well of course we eat
roots we use roots for a lot of
different things you know we could use
carrots onions things like that but also
some plants we can use to make sugar
right that's really good and delicious
okay another thing that we use leaves
for did you have did you know this this
is very interesting leaves are used to
make toothpaste so when you're brushing
your teeth tonight or after your next
meal when you use your toothpaste think
about that part of the toothpaste not
the whole toothpaste but part of the
toothpaste was made from plants leaves
wow that's great that's very interesting
isn't it
finally what do we use flowers for of
course if you if you go into your mom's
bedroom of course you know be careful
there but sometimes your mom smells very
nice doesn't she well perhaps she put on
a little perfume and we use we use
flowers to make perfume it's what gives
the perfume a nice smell if you go up to
a flower in the springtime and you smell
that flower mmm it smells good doesn't
it smells great well of course we can
use flowers to make perfume to get that
same sort of smell okay so let's
grevioux here which is the correct plant
part for the picture we just covered how
we use different parts of the plant for
a different thing
so what do we use to make these
different things over here the first
picture we have a picture of a house so
what part of the plant do we use to make
a house do we use a the leaves or B the
stem do you remember aha
that's right it's the stem we use the
stem especially for trees okay because
trees have the wood and you can see that
this house they didn't really cut the
wood they just use the trunk or the stem
of the tree to make the house very
easily and very simply here okay let's
move on what is the picture of number
two what is that that looks like perfume
right you take the lid off and then you
push the little nozzle and it's sprays
perfume on you so what do we use to make
perfume what part of the plant is used
is it a the flower or B the root I hope
you guessed a the flower right because
the flower smells good if you take a
plan out and smell the roots blue that
doesn't smell good at all so I doubt
that we would make perfume from the
roots of a plant the flower smells much
much nicer doesn't it so of course we
use the flower to make perfume okay
finally over here number three right
what is this a picture of this looks
like toothpaste although it looks like
they're wasting the toothpaste don't do
this right but you just put a little bit
of toothpaste on your toothbrush when
you brush your teeth think about this
what part of the plant is used to make
toothpaste is it a fruit B leaves now I
know what you're thinking you're
thinking fruit because that would taste
good right
but I'm sorry it's not the fruit right
the part of the plant that we use to
make toothpaste are the leaves leaves
remember those are many leaves one leaf
but many leaves we use leaves to make
toothpaste too bad it would be nice if
we use the fruit maybe the toothpaste
which would taste really good right but
it's not good for
a toothpaste we use leaves to make the
toothpaste okay let's continue with our
review here we have some true or false
questions so the directions are circle
true over here for true if the statement
is true circle F here is F if the
statement is false let's go over these
statements we have three statements here
the first one a stem carries water to
the plant so remember when we were
talking about the different parts of a
plant we have the roots we have the stem
and we have the leaves so the roots take
in water and how does that water get to
the rest of the plant the stem carries
water to the plant so this statement is
true true a stem does carry water to the
rest of the plant let's move on to
number two a branch is a long and sharp
leaf does that sound correct a branch is
if you can imagine a leaf you know the
green part of the plant very long and
sharp sharp you got to be careful if
it's sharp right sharp means it's
dangerous it can it can poke you is that
does that sound right that's not correct
right that's false because a branch
remember is like an arm of a tree it's
part of the stem that comes out it's
part of the wood actually that comes off
the stem the branch comes out and it
supports many other leaves on the tree
so a branch is not a leaf
it's part of the stem it's an arm of the
stem it's an arm of the plant that comes
out and supports more leaves that is a
branch okay
so number three the body of a tree is
called the stem remember when we were
talking about the uses of a plant we've
said that we use the stem of a tree to
make houses to make shelter and that is
what we call the stem right so the body
of a tree is called the stem that is
true by the way usually we use another
word to talk about the stem of a tree
and that word is
crunk TR un k trunk so for a tree we
talk about trunk for all plants it's
called the stem so yes we can say the
stem of a tree but we also normally
commonly say the trunk of a tree that's
also correct okay so these we have these
statements down the body of a tree is
called the stem that is true it is also
sometimes called the trunk okay you guys
learned a lot so far let's take a short
break okay okay well welcome back we've
talked about the many different parts of
a plant we've looked at the words to
describe the parts of a plant in this
section let's go over a short reading
passage that kind of summarizes or
covers the topic that we've been talking
about okay
so we're going to look at a a
well-written passage that describes the
topic that we are talking about in this
unit and we can see here the first
sentence of this reading there are many
different parts of plants this is our
topic sentence isn't it this is our
topic sentence our subject is plants
specifically we are talking about parts
of plants so our overall subject is
plants specifically exactly we are
talking about the different parts of
plants so the rest of the reading will
be describing what are the different
parts of the plants let's continue the
plant the parts help a plant to grow so
first we said there are many parts of a
plant our next sentence tells us what
those parts do what do they do they help
a plant to grow so all the different
parts of the plant help the plant to
grow
then of course the next section we're
going to talk about these parts of a
plant we're going to organize the ideas
somehow in this case we're going to
start at the bottom and work
way up so we're gonna talk about the
roots first and that's exactly what we
have the roots of a plant take in water
and hold the plant in the ground
so the next sentence we're starting with
the roots this is our organizational
style starting from the bottom going to
the top roots what do they do two things
they take in water and they hold the
plant in the ground securely so it
doesn't fall over right okay so two
things let's continue the next thing
we're moving up right our organizational
style is from the bottom to the top so
the next point is this part right and
this part of course is the stem the stem
what does it do it carries food and
water through the plant and it also
holds up the plant it holds up the plant
above the ground so we've talked about
the stem the next part moving up what's
the next part we can see that they are
the leaves
remember pronunciation leaves okay so
the leaves what do they do
we've talked about what the roots do
we've talked about what the stem does
now it's time to talk about what do the
leaves do what do they do they take in
air and light for the plant so the
leaves take in air and light for the
plant so we've started out of the roots
we've talked about the stem we're on the
leaves now what would the next part of
the plant be that's right this beautiful
part of the plant right up here and
that's at the top that's at the very top
of the plant that's towards the end of
our discussion about the parts of the
plant the flowers of the plants make
fruit so what do the flowers do they
make fruit flowers of course are very
beautiful that's just an extra thought
that we're putting in there people can
eat the fruit that's how it benefits us
also the fruit holds seeds and we'll
talk about that later on but the fruit
holds seeds okay
oranges apples lemons and bananas are
delicious fruit aren't they yeah you
probably eat a lot of these every week
right I hope that you eat at least some
fruit every day right so whether it's
oranges apples lemons or bananas these
are all different kinds of delicious
fruit and it's good for you
trees are a different kind of plant they
are very big plants trees have branches
so that's another type that's another
part of a plant that we didn't talk
about I mean you could maybe call these
branches but this is a small plant if
we're talking about a tree a very big
tree the part of the tree that comes off
the stem those are called branches
branches of course are the arms of a
tree they have many leaves okay so we've
seen the reading passage that was
talking about the different parts of the
plant remember our topic sentence was
there are many different parts of a
plant so let's take a look at that
reading and let's look at the main idea
and details whenever you have a short
passage is short essay or a short
description about something that is
written out you can break it down you
can look at how it is organized there's
always a main idea and then there are
support sentences details what is the
main idea of this passage the main idea
of course is that there are many parts
of the plant and also the parts of the
plant
help it live and grow that is the main
idea of this passage then we see the
details what did the roots do the roots
take in B that's a and hold the plant in
the beep okay so the first part of the
plant that we talked about of course are
the roots and we can talk about what do
the roots do they do two things one
thing a what do the roots take in do you
remember from our discussion before in
the reading the roots of course will
take in which word down here we have air
flower stem water seeds and ground so
which one of these
things do the roots take in if you
guessed water you are correct
very good the roots take in water from
the ground also that's one thing they do
the second thing they do they hold the
plant where where do they hold the plant
which one of these words would fit into
this blank well if you look at it you
will see they hold the plant in the
ground right the plant is in the ground
and the roots are holding that plant
firmly in the ground so that it does not
fall over okay okay so let's move on to
the next detail we've talked about the
roots we're gonna talk about the next
part of the plant now remember we start
at the bottom and we worked our way up
first we talked about the roots we're
gonna talk about the second part of the
plant the BEP carries food and water and
holds up the plant so what's the second
part of the plant that we talked about
air flower stem water seeds ground
if you guessed stem you are correct that
is the second part of the plant that we
talked about that gets back to our
organization to first roots stem leaves
and flowers so the next part again is
the leaves the leaves take in what what
do the leaves take and remember the
leaves take in two things they take in
light and something else the leaves are
not underground they're out in the open
they're out in the air right so the
leaves take in air and light for the
plant and this is how the plant gets
light and air to help it grow we're on
the final part of the plant
do you remember so we start at the roots
stem leaves the final part of the plant
that's e the beep make fruit what part
of the plant makes fruit if you guessed
flowers you would be correct the flowers
that part of the plant makes fruit what
does the fruit hold that's our final
word here the fruit holds what the fruit
holds seeds that's correct
like I said before if you open an apple
or you open a lemon or if you open any
anytime
or fruit you will find seeds in the
fruit so this is our reading skill this
is our main idea these are the details
ok for the reading passage and as you
can see it's very well organized we
start at the roots the bottom we moved
up to the stem then we talked about the
leaves and finally at the top of the
plant we talked about the flowers and
what they do okay let's move on now we
have a review here this is reading
comprehension right how well did you
understand the reading passage let's
take a look at the different questions
question number one the roots of a plant
are found in the a air B soil C leaves
now this might be a little tricky
because they're using a different word
right before we learned about ground the
roots of a plant are in the ground what
is another word that means the same as
ground and that would be of course soil
soil is the same as ground whoops there
we go G R o U and D whoops my d is
strange I'm sorry D okay so soil is the
same as ground okay so the roots of a
plant are found in the soil the roots of
the plant are found in the ground okay
let's move on to the second one the stem
of a plant carries what do you remember
what the stem of the plant does what
does it do it carries something does it
carry water in food a does it carry B
air air and light or sea soil and ground
which is interesting because these are
the same thing right I just said soil
and ground at the same thing so that's
probably not the right answer
does the stem of the plant carry air in
light know what the stem of the plant
does it carries water and food from the
roots up to the rest of the plant so the
correct answer here is a the stem of a
plant carries water and food from the
roots up to the rest of the plants okay
let's move on we have another couple of
questions number three the flowers of a
and make fruit what does the fruit do
does the fruit hold up the plant A or B
that hold lemons or apples or C that
people can eat so the flowers of a plant
make fruit this question is about what
the fruit does here we have that that
that all of these that's are referring
back to the fruit what is true about the
fruit does fruit hold up the plant hold
the plant holds up the fruit right the
stem holds up the plant and that holds
the fruit B does the fruit hold lemons
or apples no the fruit is lemons or
apples so it doesn't hold lemons or
apples is it true that people can eat
fruit that is true so that is our
correct answer the flowers of a plant
make fruit that people can eat that is
our only true statement C about fruit so
the answer is the flowers of a plant
make fruit that people can eat that you
and I can eat and we should eat at least
every day okay number four the leaves
take in air and light and then we have
the rest of the sentence now if you look
at the rest of the sentence be careful
because we have a comma here we have an
end and we have different subjects for
the rest of the sentence this is
actually a compound sentence there's the
one subject is here right the leaves
take in air in light that's true and
then we have the stem the leaves or the
flowers okay so we have to find a true
statement from a B and C about the new
subject don't get confused we're not
talking about leaves again we're talking
about something different now true B is
talking about leaves but a is talking
about the stem C is talking about the
flowers so we don't really need this
first part of the sentence we only
really need to pay attention to the
second part of the sentence so a the
stem holds up the plant is that true
that is true it's probably our answer B
the leaves turn into seeds the leaves
turn into
seats that's not true the fruit carries
the seats not the leaves so B is
probably is not our answer that's not
true right remember maybe a let's look
at si the flowers carry food and water
the flowers carry food and water know
the stem carries food and water the
flowers don't do that so that is also
incorrect our only true answer is a our
only correct answer is a the leaves take
in air and light and the stem holds up
the plant so be careful this is a little
difficult of a sentence two subjects one
the leaves to the stem so you don't
really need to worry about the first
part of the sentence the second part of
the sentence is what you really have to
pay attention to because we're switching
we're changing the subject so which is
the true part which is the true
statement okay let's move on and we have
come to the end of our presentation we
have talked about how the parts of a
plant help it live and grow and again
just to review very quickly we have a
very good picture of a plant here we've
talked about the roots we've talked
about the stem we've talked about the
leaves and we've talked about the
flowers also remember on a tree we've
talked about the the branches of a tree
and we've also talked about the flowers
turning into fruit and holding the seeds
so it plants are very amazing aren't
they we use them for a lot of different
things like I said before we use them
for food we use them for shelter and
they also actually make the air that we
breathe so next time after this lesson
go out enjoy nature go look at the
plants and now you know what the
different parts of the plants are and
you know a little bit more about how we
use those parts take care everybody see
you next time</p></div>
