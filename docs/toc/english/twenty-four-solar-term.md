## 关于二十四节气

There are twenty-four **solar term**s in the **lunar calendar** that indicate the passage of the seasons and their changes.

In ancient times, it was used as a new calendar to guide farm work.

Today, it's also a compass for predicting the temperature, rain, and snow in everyday life.

It's also unique to the Chinese calendar and is the culmination of ancient Chinese laborers' experience and wisdom.

The year is planned around spring, so the first term begins with spring.
