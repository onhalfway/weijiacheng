# Morning With Reading

Let's start the morning with reading

## Spring

Sometimes warm sometimes cold, sometimes rainy as I've told.

People planting, kids all playing but not too long to get cold.

Running round in the rain not all puddles are the same.

Imitating Indigos open purple pedals.

No one has worries not on no, no.

Green grass green trees all in one big family.

## Winter Fun

Winter Wonderland

Igloo's in the snow

New snow falling

Tubing down hills

Everyone having

Reindeer racing to deliver presents.

## My Fall Poem

Family and friends get together for Thanksgiving

Autumn leaves are different colors

Lots of fun jumping in leaves

Leftover turkey we eat many days

## The Twelve Months

January comes with frost and snow,

February brings us winds that blow,

March has winds and happy hours,

April brings us sun and showers,

Pretty is the month of May,

June has flowers sweet and gay,

July begins our holiday,

August bears us all away,

September takes us back to school,

October days begin to cool,

November brings the leaves to earth,

December, Christmas with its mirth.

## The Significance Of Failure

Robert H. Schuller

Failure doesn't mean you are a failure,

It does mean you haven't succeeded yet.

Failure doesn't mean you have accomplished nothing,

It does mean you have learned something.

Failure doesn't mean you have been a fool,

It does mean you had a lot of faith.

Failure doesn't mean you've been disgraced,

It does mean you were willing to try.

Failure doesn't mean you don't have it,

It does mean you have to do something in a different way.

Failure doesn't mean you are inferior,

It does mean you are not perfect.

Failure doesn't mean you've wasted your life,

It does mean you have a reason to start afresh.

Failure doesn't mean you should give up,

It doesn't mean you must try harder.

Failure doesn't mean you'll never make it,

It does mean it will take a little longer.

Failure doesn't mean God has abandoned you,

It does mean God has a better idea.

## Sing A Season Song

Snow snow,

shiver and blow.

Icicle popsicles,

drip, drop and dropsicles.

High-balling,

low-balling,

everyone's snowballing

and it keeps going on snowing.

Snowflakes on snow cakes,

and pictures the frost makes

Fingers and toes freeze

and cold makes my nose sneeze.

Turn the heat on,

the winter is gone.

Frogs, trees

hum-bumble bees,

blossome and possums

and gossamer breeze.

Daffodils on the hills,

pillows of lawn.

First rabbit,

first robin,

first baby fawn.

Then springtime is gone.

Water, waves,

shimmering days.

Toes wiggle,

fish wriggle in a strange haze.

Run over, turn over.

Day shines at night.

Winking out,

blinking out,

firefly light

off-again-on.

Then summer is gone

Leaf.

Leaves drifting from trees

Capture

and keep them,

fling them

and heap them.

Pumpkins and gourds

and the clamor of herds.

Honking geese Vs

And the bare-bones of trees.

The very first freeze

making berry-red knees.

Late, later dawn.

Then autumn is gone.

Round we all go...

shiver and blow

and here, once again,

comes the snow.
