### Go Camping

Dear Tony,
I'd like to talk about my camping. I enjoy going camping with my friends because it's always great fun. **We usually plan ahead and remember to take everything we need, such as tents and blankets.** During the camping, we feel relaxed to see natural scenery and play together to enjoy each other's company. We are happy and excited. I'm always looking forward to going camping with my friends.
Yours,
Li Hua

- 不少作文里也出现了好词好句，同学们可以有选择的记一些，上图字迹工整，内容分别回答了who what和how，得分点抓得准，语法和书写无误，整体很规矩。
- 26日小作文反馈：1.去露营go camping；不是go to camp，也不是go camp  2.回家是gohome/go back home;不是go to home  3.我感到兴奋应该是I feel excited；不是i feel exciting或者I am feel excited。4.我感到放松的应该是I feel relaxed；不是I feel relax；relax是动词；relaxed才是形容词 5.香肠三明治sausage sandwich注意拼写；另外大家可积累一些露营时的常见用品词汇，注意单复数 6.露营地camp site中间有空格  7.enjoy+doing sth  8.感到/感受/感觉是feel，为什么老有同学写成fell呢？
