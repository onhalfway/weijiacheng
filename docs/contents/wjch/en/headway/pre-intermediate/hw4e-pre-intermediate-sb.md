Kenny, I see you have more than 300 friends on Facebook!
Amazing, isn't it? I don't know how it happened. I think it's because my job takes me all over the world and I make friends wherever I go. 我想这是因为我的工作让我周游世界，我走到哪里都能交到朋友。
I travel too, but I don't have that many friends.
Come on Judy. I'm your friend, that's one friend at least!
But what about close friends? How many of the 300 are close?
I have no idea.
No idea? More than ten? More than twenty?
Er, probably no more than ten really close friends.
So, who's your oldest friend?
That's easy. Pete's my oldest friend - since we were both 16, and he came to my school. He lives in Canada now. But he was **best man** (伴郎,男傧相) **at my wedding** and I was best man at his.

Is he your oldest friend?
No, Zac's my oldest friend. You know that - since we **sat next to each other** in class 1. Zac and me are going to travel the world together when we finish school.
Can I come?
NO, YOU CAN'T! Just shut ...
Well, can Thomas be my friend?
Toby, be quiet about friends! You're so boring, I'm not surprised you have no friends.
But can I ...?
No, no, no! I'm off. See you!
But ...

I know they met at the hospital when they went for check-ups before we were born.

most popular dish in the whole country
my grandfather made the best fish and
chips in the area people came to the
village by bus especially to get them

he was such a happy and contented man he
worked hard but once a week he closed
the shop and went to have lunch
not fish and chips with friends in the
local pub he didn't retire until he was
78 years old he said that the secrets of
a long life was a glass of whiskey

tapescript 4.7 unusual restaurants
one 
Alexander we were on honeymoon and we saw some
brochures about this restaurant it was
my wife's birthday so I thought why not
it's expensive but you don't find many
restaurants like this it was difficult
to get a reservation because it only
takes 12 people when we arrived we had
drinks on the deck above and someone
gave us a talk about how they built the
restaurant and then we took off our
shoes and descended down down the spiral
stairs and into the restaurant actually
the restaurant itself isn't very
exciting the decor I mean but it doesn't
need to be because what is totally
amazing is the view it takes your breath
away all around and above your head are
hundreds maybe thousands of fish all
colours in a blue blue sea I was sitting
opposite my wife when a turtle appeared
just behind her head in fact we were so
busy looking at it all we almost forgot
that we were there to eat the food was
delicious fish of course but to be
honest we felt a bit bad eating white
fish surrounded by white fish there was
just one problem
a guest at the next table he spoke
really loudly and complained about
everything we couldn't find anything to
complain about it was the perfect
honeymoon restaurant - hums I booked
online of course it's the only way you
can book and I went with my sons they
are five and eight years old and I
thought they would like it a lot they
were very excited they had the idea that
the waiters were robots so when we
arrived and there was nobody there at
all
they were a bit disappointed but the
whole place was amazing it was like
walking inside a computer so the boys
soon became excited again we picked up a
card and sat down at one of the big
round red tables the boys loved the
touch screen TVs they got the idea
immediately and started choosing food
from the pictures while we were waiting
they were texting their mother to tell
her how fantastic it all was in just a
few minutes pots with our meals inside
came flying down the spiral tubing in
the middle of the table the boys
couldn't believe it they were shouting
with excitement we all had steak and
salad and then the boys had baked
bananas with ice cream and chocolate
it was delicious there was an older lady
sitting next to us she was a bit
confused so we helped her she said I
think this is more for young people than
people my age maybe she's right three
lucy i was hung
when I arrived at the restaurant but
when I saw the crane I forgot about
being hungry I was so frightened the
host David said don't worry it's a
hundred percent safe huh I'm sure a few
of the other guests felt like me they
looked very pale anyway we sat down at
this huge table fastened our seatbelts
and up up up we went I couldn't look
down everyone was saying what a
wonderful view but I just couldn't look
then one of the waiters put a glass of
wine in my hand and I opened my eyes and
the view was amazing people were waving
to us from the ground they probably
thought we were mad the weather was
perfect thank goodness just the little
breeze I began to enjoy it the other
guests were all great fun I didn't know
anyone at the start but I soon made some
friends and the food was good too
especially the prawns the chef cooked
them in front of us on a tiny cooker but
best of all was at the end when
everybody learnt my name they started
singing Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds no
diamonds but I was certainly in the sky
I was quite sorry when we came down to
earth again

Dinner in the sky
FACT FILE
• 50m up in the air
• a table 9m x 5m
• diners hang from a crane
• there isn't a loo
Dinner in the Sky is for people who want more than
a little excitement when they go out to eat.
They sit at a huge table which hangs from
a crane fifty metres in the air. It's not a good idea for
people who are afraid of heights or for those who don't
have much money. It costs £10,000. The twenty-two
diners wear seat belts and relax and enjoy the views
while the chefs prepare the finest food in front of them.
The restaurant opened in Belgium in 2006, but now has
Belgium /ˈbeldʒəm/ n. 比利时（西欧国家，首都布鲁塞尔Brussels）
branches in Paris, Dubai, Florida, and Las Vegas.
David Ghysels, the Belgian organizer says, 'We realized
that people were bored with going to the same old
restaurants. They wanted to try something different.
The sky's the limit with us!'
The crane is checked carefully before every sitting.
The table is 9m x 5m and weighs six tonnes. In the centre
there is a sunken platform for the chef and two waiters.
The food is delicious, but most guests don't feel like
eating until after a few drinks! Then they also get the
courage to look down at the ground where tiny people
are looking up in amazement and waving.
Dinner in the Sky is very exciting and the food is good,
but there are problems. For example, even in quiet
weather conversation is difficult because of the wind.
Guests shout to each other across the table. Also, the
100. You can't go to the 100 until the table descends
again. Difficult for some! But later, back on earth, after
a visit to the loo, the guests have a great experience to
talk about.

Elsa aged 26 I finish University and I
started training to be a lawyer I was
earning good money and in many ways I
had a good life but the more I studied
law the more I hated it I was bored and
miserable so I decided to give it all up
and go traveling I was away for a year I
went to Australia and New Zealand North
and South America it was fantastic but
then I arrived back home I was now 24
and with no money no job and no it's
live I moved back with mum and dads
they're wonderful they don't make me pay
rent but oh dear and it's like being a
little girl again at the moment I'm
working as a waitress just to make a bit
of money and my dad keeps asking when
are you going to find a real job the mum
says when I was your age I was married
with two children married with kids I
don't feel old enough for that I've got
a boyfriend but we're not thinking of
getting married
maybe I'll train to be a teacher now
that's a real job Dan aged 24 when I
left home at 18 I thought that was it
goodbye mum and dad now six years later
I'm back my college days were great I
worked hard and played hard but I left
with huge debts over 15,000 pounds I
thought no problem
I'll just get a job and pay it back I
moved into a flat with some friends and
I was lucky I got a job pretty quickly
but I want to be a journalist and the
only way is to begin at the bottom I'm a
very junior reporter for a small local
newspaper I love working there but I
only earn sixteen thousand pounds a year

flat so here I am back with mum and dad

kids who grow up leave home and then
move back again lots of my friends are
doing the same my girlfriend is back
with her mum too one day we're hoping to
marry and get a place of our own but

Annie dear mark good preparation is the
answer you must prepare well and

Tracy the fact is that to get to the top
in sport you have to train very hard

friend was he wanted to know what the
bear had said to him the bear gave me
some advice said his companion he said
next time you go on a journey travel
with someone who won't leave you at the
first sign of danger the moral of this
story is choose your friends carefully

tapescript 9.3 questions and answers 1
why were the travelers tired because
they had walked 20 miles to why were
they hungry because they hadn't eaten
all day 3 why did one of them pretend to
be dead because he had heard that bears
don't like eating dead meat

I was nervous on the plane because I had
never flown before
- when I'd had breakfast I went to work
3
I met a girl
at a party her face was familiar I was
sure I'd seen her somewhere before for I
felt tired all day yesterday because I
hadn't slept the night before five
my wife was angry with me because I'd
forgotten our anniversary six the little
girl was crying because she'd fallen
over and hurt herself 

tapescript 9.6 nine
point six the boy who cried wolf once
upon a time there was a shepherd boy who
looked after the sheep in the hills near
his village he thought his job was very
boring one day while he was sitting
under a tree he had an idea he decided
to have some fun so he went down to the
village and shouted wolf wolf at the top
of his voice as soon as the villagers
heard the boy they stopped work and
raced to the hills to help him but when
they got there they saw nothing they
returned to their work after they'd gone
the Shepherd boys smiled to himself a
few days later the boy did the same
thing again he ran into the village and
shouted wolf wolf the villagers didn't
know whether to believe him or not but
they were worried about their sheep so
they had to help him they went back to
the hills again there was no wolf they
were angry because the shepherd boy had
lied again but he just laughed then the
next day just as the Sun was setting a
wolf really did appear and it began
attacking the sheep in terror the boy
raced down the hill to the village
shouting
wolf wolf although the villagers heard
his cries they did nothing to help this
time they really didn't believe him the
shepherd boy climbed back up the hill to
look for the sheep but the wolf had
killed them all he was so ashamed of
himself
that he sat down in the moonlight and
cried the moral of this story is you
should not lie a liar will not be
believed even when he tells the truth

tapescript 9.8 point 8 my favorite writer
Tom you chose Charles Dickens as your
favorite writer can you tell us a little
about him when was he alive he wrote in
the 19th century he was born in England
in 1812 and died in 1870 what did he
write what sort of books he wrote novels
and short stories and tell us why is he
famous at the time he was writing there
was a lot of inequality between the rich
in the poor Dickens wanted to change
society he wrote about people who were
poor and hungry or ill or who were
unfortunate in some way
Dickens created some of the most famous
characters in English literature
what are his best-known books there are
quite a few but possibly David
Copperfield which has a lot of
autobiography in it and Oliver Twist and
after that a Christmas Carol in this
book we meet a character called Scrooge
ah the man who hated Christmas that's
right at the beginning of the story
Scrooge is a miserable character who
refuses to spend any money to help his
poor family but by the end he is a
changed man kind generous and full of
love for people around him what was
Dickens personal life like hmm a mix of
good and bad his parents were poor
Dickens
became very rich he married and had 10
children 10 yes but he left his wife
because he fell in love with an actress
he didn't get divorced in those days it
was impossible absolutely out of the
question so there was a lot of sadness
in his life oh dear poor mr. Dickens

tapescript 9.9 my favorite writer now
Alice you chose Robert Louis Stevenson
tell us about him when was he writing
well he was born in 1850 and he died in
1894 so he was writing just after
Dickens in the second half of the
nineteenth century and what did he write
he wrote novels and poetry and he was
also a
Avel writer Oh quite a lot um tell us
why is he famous well he isn't as famous
as Dickens but he's very popular because
he's a great storyteller his stories are
about adventure danger and horror his
heroes are pure and his villains are
dark
what are his best-known books there's a
children's book called Treasure Island
and there's a travel story about going
around France but the most famous is the
Strange Case of dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde
and they I suppose are his most well
known characters yes the book was an
immediate success it's about a man who
has two sides to his character one good
and one bad the man dr. Jekyll has a
battle inside himself between his good
side and his evil side this is the
psychological idea of someone with a
split personality yes in everyday speech
we say about someone oh he's a real
Jekyll and Hyde meaning there are two
sides to their personality fascinating
tell us about his personal life as a
child he was often ill he married an
American woman who had children from an
earlier marriage but they didn't have
any children together he traveled a lot
to Europe and the United States he died
very young when he was just 44 oh well
Thank You Alice for telling us about
Robert Louis Stevenson 

tapescript 9.10
The Strange Case of dr. Jekyll and mr.
Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson
London 1886 one late one night a lawyer
Gabriel Utterson was walking home
through dark silent streets when he saw
a man attacking a woman Utterson ran
after him and caught him the man's name
was mr. Hyde and he looked ugly and evil
[Music]
too mr. Hyde showed no regret for what
he had done to buy the woman's silence
he wrote her a check give this to the
rich Utterson noticed that the cheque
was signed in the name of dr. jekyll a
well-known and well-respected man
[Music]
three Utterson was worried he was dr.
Jekyll's lawyer and also his friend he
went to visit him as soon as he
mentioned mr. Hyde dr. Jekyll turned
pale and became angry my position is
very strange I cannot explain Utterson
was confused who was mr. Hyde
[Music]
for a year past one night an old man was
murdered as he was walking home a maid
witnessed the crime and recognized the
killer mr. Hyde had struck again the
police went looking for Hyde but he had
disappeared five again
Utterson went to visit his friend dr.
Jekyll he suspected that dr. Jekyll had
helped mr. Hyde to escape when
questioned the doctor replied in a
strange wild voice that mr. Hyde had
gone forever six over the next few weeks
dr. Jekyll's behavior became more and
more unusual he locked himself in his
laboratory and refused to open the door
his servants were worried when they
heard his voice it sounded different
[Music]
was that my master's voice
they asked Utterson for help
[Music]
vii Utterson and the servants broke down
the door mr. Hyde was lying dead on the
floor
it's mr. Hyde no it's dr. Jekyll he had
taken poison but why was he wearing dr.
Jekyll's clothes and where was the
doctor were dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde one
and the same person
[Music]
eight on the desk was a letter addressed
to mr. Utterson in it dr. Jekyll tried
to explain himself he said he believed
that inside every human being there was
a good side and an evil side nine Jekyll
had created a potion when he drank it
his whole body changed god help me
[Music]
the good kind doctor became cruel ugly
and evil he called this other man mr.
Hyde to change back he had to drink
another potion ten but after a time
Jekyll found that he liked changing into
mr. Hyde he enjoyed being bad he became
more and more violent and cruel he took
pleasure in hurting innocent people
[Music]
eleven finally dr. Jekyll couldn't
control mr. Hyde any more he began to
change into this monster even without
taking the potion Jekyll hoped and
prayed that Hyde would disappear god
help me but Hyde always returned
[Laughter]
12 the potion to turn hide back into dr.
Jekyll no longer worked it had lost its
strengths dr. Jekyll could no longer get
rid of the evil mr. Hyde he had to kill
this monster but to kill mr. Hyde
dr. Jekyll also had to die
I can live in this world No

tapescript 12.6 twelve point six Lily's dream I'd love a
baby brother if I had a baby brother I
would play with him all the time we'd
have a lot of fun I'd be so happy I
wouldn't ask my mum and dad for anything
else

tapescript 12.7 twelve point seven Sam's
dream I'd like to be taller
if I were taller I'd be in the first
team at rugby and if I played really
well I'd be captain and then if I
practiced SRIA Lee hard maybe one day I
could play for England my dad would be
so proud of me
Annie's dream I have two kids I love
them but I never have any time to myself
if I had a free weekend I'd stay in bed
all day I'd read magazines and watch TV
then I'd sleep all night and my children
wouldn't wake me Oh heaven 

tapescript 12.8 Tony's life well he's not much good
at anything he hasn't had a job since he
left school
so he hasn't got any money so he can't
buy any new clothes he never looked
smart and he doesn't know what kind of
job he wants he's not ambitious at all
so he doesn't apply for many jobs I
think the problem is that he's lazy he
doesn't get up till midday and he
doesn't shave he doesn't even shower
often he doesn't look good maybe that's
why he hasn't got a girlfriend he's
useless 

tapescript 12.9 if Tony had a
job if Tony had a job he'd have some
money if he had some money he could buy
some new clothes if he had some nice
clothes he'd look smarter if he was a
bit more ambitious he would apply for
more jobs if he weren't so lazy he'd get
up before midday if he shaved and
showered more he'd look better if he
looked better he might get a girlfriend
and that would help him a lot 

tape scripts 12.10 one Jimmy's problem Amy
can I talk to you for a minute sure what
about well I've got a bit of a problem
you know I'm in my first year at
University I'm really enjoying the
course I love what I'm doing studying
physics but I was waiting for a but yes
you're right I'm also in a band there
are three of us and we've been playing
together for a couple of years and we
just got a cording contract which is
something we've been trying to get for
ages and you can't do both is that it
absolutely the other guys want me to
drop her of university if the record was
a success we'd go on tour we might go to
Europe for three months or we might even
get to America that would be amazing but
if you dropped out of university and the
band wasn't a success then what would
you do exactly that's the problem but
if I didn't give the band a chance I'd
regret it for the rest of my life this
is our one big chance but if the band
didn't work you wouldn't have a career
and my parents would go crazy Amy help
me what do I do
well I think you should try with the
band if it doesn't work it's not the end
of the world you could always go back to
University and you might hit the big
time in the music business - Fiona's
problem Jenny you've got to help me what
is it are you all right
yes I'm fine but I'm having terrible
boyfriend trouble what with Sam I
thought you two were fine we are sort of
and very fond of Sam we've been going
out for over a year and we do things
together but but that but I've met this
guy at work and he's asked me out and I
don't know what to do wow this is sudden
well not really the thing is everyone
thinks that Sam and I are a couple and
we're going to get married but for me
Sam is more like a brother I can't marry
him if I married Sam I'd be so unhappy
but if I broke up with him he would be
heartbroken I don't know what he'd do
but it sounds like you have to say
something if you don't tell him now it
might be worse later who's this man at
work well he's really lovely his name's
Harry he's my age and he's very
good-looking we work together and it's
such fun he really makes me laugh
he isn't pushing me to go out with him
but but you'd really like to I know and
if I don't say anything to him he might
think I don't like him so what do I do
well if I were you
I
say anything to this guy at work yet
would be nice to him but don't encourage
him but he might go out with another
girl if he started going out with
another girl then you know what sort of
man he was if he likes you he'll wait
but you have to talk to Sam first 

tape scripts 12.11 point 11 a year later Jimmy
well we made a record and we went on
tour to Japan and the band's doing
really not bad we haven't had the big
time but we've had one or two hits and
we're very well known in some parts of
the world we haven't been to America yet
but we hope to soon and my parents have
been ok well my mother has my father
keeps saying when are you going to get a
real job but he doesn't approve of
anything I do so that's nothing new so
it was the right decision
Fiona well I told Sam and in fact he was
fine about it he also said that he
thought we were more like brother and
sister I was quite upset that it wasn't
more upset anyway he was alright about
it and of course all our friends said
that they had seen this all along so I
broke up with Sam and it didn't work out
with Harry at all it turned out that he
was engaged to a lovely French girl and
he was just being friendly with me so I
got the situation completely wrong never
mind I'm single but that's fine I'll
just see what happens

tape scripts 12.12 12 point 12 note taking
part 1
generally I am optimistic about the
future if you go back to the beginning
of the 19th century most Americans lived
for about 50 years
nowadays life expectancy is nearly 80
years this is because of great
improvements in health care and
technology there's no reason why this
won't continue far into the 21st century
the world has changed so much in the
last 20 years we have DNA microchips and
the internet we must teach people to use
this new technology I believe that one
day everybody will have computers and
access to the Internet for over 2,000
years we have tried to understand our
environment
now we are beginning to control it as
well we are learning how to control the
weather and one day we'll learn to
control earthquakes and volcanoes
eventually illness and disease will not
exist because we will build new body
parts new livers kidneys hearts lungs
like spare parts for a car
people say well population is an
increasing problem but if people become
more educated and richer they won't need
or want to have so many children and the
population of many countries will
decrease I believe that one day there
will be a world government because the
resources of the world will have to be
managed at a global level we need to
make global decisions we already have a
world language called English and there
is now a worldwide communication system
called the internet 

tapescript 
twelve-point 12.13
I do have some reasons to be pessimistic
I think people will remain fundamentally
the same there will always be stupid
people as well as intelligent people
there will always be cruel people who
want to fight and wage wars there will
be people who don't understand that we
have to look after our world our forests
our oceans our atmosphere there will
certainly always be people who think
that money is everything we have the
technology but we need the wisdom to go
with it

tapescript 12.14 twelve point fourteen
prepositions one it wasn't an accident
she broke it on purpose to what's for
dinner
I'm starving three he isn't in the
office this week he's away on business

13:28
couples meet a survey of over 10,000
13:33
couples ask them how they first met the
13:37
top three were first with 22% at work
13:44
second with 20% through friends and
13:49
third with 15% at school or university
13:57
next with 12% was meeting online
14:03
nowadays more and more couples are
14:06
meeting this way just 8% met at a bar or
14:11
Club and 5% through the family which was
14:16
quite surprising
14:18
only 4% met on a blind date perhaps not
14:24
so surprising
14:25
last of all just 1% met while shopping
14:30

he doesn't get up til the afternoon and
31:18
he weighs jeans and a t-shirt all the
31:21
time he never looks smart he certainly
31:24
never wears a suit goodness knows where

4.7 unusual restaurants one Alexander we
63:09
were on honeymoon and we saw some
63:11
brochures about this restaurant it was
63:13
my wife's birthday so I thought why not
63:16
it's expensive but you don't find many
63:19
restaurants like this it was difficult
63:22
to get a reservation because it only
63:24
takes 12 people when we arrived we had
63:27
drinks on the deck above and someone
63:30
gave us a talk about how they built the
63:32
restaurant and then we took off our
63:34
shoes and descended down down the spiral
63:38
stairs and into the restaurant actually
63:42
the restaurant itself isn't very
63:44
exciting the decor I mean but it doesn't
63:48
need to be because what is totally
63:50
amazing is the view it takes your breath
63:53
away all around and above your head are
63:56
hundreds maybe thousands of fish all
64:00
colours in a blue blue sea I was sitting
64:05
opposite my wife when a turtle appeared
64:07
just behind her head in fact we were so
64:11
busy looking at it all we almost forgot
64:13
that we were there to eat the food was
64:16
delicious fish of course but to be
64:19
honest we felt a bit bad eating white
64:22
fish surrounded by white fish there was
64:26
just one problem
64:28
a guest at the next table he spoke
64:31
really loudly and complained about
64:33
everything we couldn't find anything to
64:36
complain about it was the perfect
64:38
honeymoon restaurant - hums I booked
64:45
online of course it's the only way you
64:48
can book and I went with my sons they
64:52
are five and eight years old and I
64:55
thought they would like it a lot they
64:57
were very excited they had the idea that
65:01
the waiters were robots so when we
65:04
arrived and there was nobody there at
65:06
all
65:07
they were a bit disappointed but the
65:10
whole place was amazing it was like
65:14
walking inside a computer so the boys
65:17
soon became excited again we picked up a
65:21
card and sat down at one of the big
65:24
round red tables the boys loved the
65:27
touch screen TVs they got the idea
65:30
immediately and started choosing food
65:32
from the pictures while we were waiting
65:36
they were texting their mother to tell
65:38
her how fantastic it all was in just a
65:42
few minutes pots with our meals inside
65:45
came flying down the spiral tubing in
65:47
the middle of the table the boys
65:50
couldn't believe it they were shouting
65:52
with excitement we all had steak and
65:56
salad and then the boys had baked
65:59
bananas with ice cream and chocolate
66:01
it was delicious there was an older lady
66:06
sitting next to us she was a bit
66:08
confused so we helped her she said I
66:12
think this is more for young people than
66:15
people my age maybe she's right three
66:21
lucy i was hung
66:25
when I arrived at the restaurant but
66:27
when I saw the crane I forgot about
66:29
being hungry I was so frightened the
66:32
host David said don't worry it's a
66:35
hundred percent safe huh I'm sure a few
66:38
of the other guests felt like me they
66:41
looked very pale anyway we sat down at
66:45
this huge table fastened our seatbelts
66:47

that our family's ancestors were

actually Norwegian they came over to

Scotland in the ninth century she says

difficult for my great-grandparents to

make a living farming so they traveled

tapescript 8 point for advice from
133:44
Annie dear mark good preparation is the
133:50
answer you must prepare well and
133:53
practice a lot the first 30 seconds are
133:56
the most important you should begin with
133:59
a personal story it will relax you and
134:03
the audience you should write your
134:06
speech down but I don't think you should
134:08
read it aloud to the group just make
134:11
notes to help you remember it for more
134:14
help you should visit speech tips calm
134:18
dear Paula more and more people
134:22
worldwide have become addicted to this
134:24
he must get professional help but this
134:27
is difficult because he won't accept
134:30
that he has a problem I think you should
134:33
show him this letter and visit the
134:35
website olga non dot org tell him firmly
134:40
that he must change his ways or he'll
134:43
lose his wife and family talk to all
134:47
your friends and family about the
134:48
problem you shouldn't suffer alone dear
134:54
Billy these feelings are very common
134:57
between brothers and sisters I'm sure
135:00
your parents love you and your brother
135:02
just the same so you shouldn't worry
135:05
about this when you're older you'll get
135:08
your own phone and your own clothes
135:12
you must talk to your parents about how
135:15
you feel and you
135:17
shouldn't feel jealous of your brother
135:19
he's older than you that's all dear
135:24
Tracy the fact is that to get to the top
135:28
in sport you have to train very hard
135:31
indeed you should talk to someone else
135:34
about your doubts I don't think you
135:37
should listen to just your friends you
135:40
should explain how you feel to your
135:42
coach and your mother however in the end
135:46
the decision is yours and yours alone
135:50
you must decide your own future tip

153:53
Tom you chose Charles Dickens as your
153:56
favorite writer can you tell us a little
153:58
about him when was he alive he wrote in
154:02
the 19th century he was born in England
154:05
in 1812 and died in 1870 what did he
154:10
write what sort of books he wrote novels
154:13
and short stories and tell us why is he
154:18
famous at the time he was writing there
154:21
was a lot of inequality between the rich
154:24
in the poor Dickens wanted to change
154:27
society he wrote about people who were
154:30
poor and hungry or ill or who were
154:33
unfortunate in some way
154:35
Dickens created some of the most famous
154:38
characters in English literature
154:40
what are his best-known books there are
154:44
quite a few but possibly David
154:48
Copperfield which has a lot of
154:50
autobiography in it and Oliver Twist and
154:54
after that a Christmas Carol in this
154:58
book we meet a character called Scrooge
155:00
ah the man who hated Christmas that's
155:04
right at the beginning of the story
155:07
Scrooge is a miserable character who
155:10
refuses to spend any money to help his
155:13
poor family but by the end he is a
155:17
changed man kind generous and full of
155:20
love for people around him what was
155:23
Dickens personal life like hmm a mix of
155:28
good and bad his parents were poor
155:32
Dickens
155:33
became very rich he married and had 10
155:37
children 10 yes but he left his wife
155:41
because he fell in love with an actress
155:43
he didn't get divorced in those days it
155:47
was impossible absolutely out of the
155:49
question so there was a lot of sadness
155:52
in his life oh dear poor mr. Dickens
155:59
tapescript 9.9 my favorite writer now
156:05
Alice you chose Robert Louis Stevenson
156:08

156:11
well he was born in 1850 and he died in
156:17
1894 so he was writing just after

Dickens in the second half of the
156:22
nineteenth century and what did he write
156:27

156:30
also a
156:31
Avel writer Oh quite a lot um tell us
156:35
why is he famous well he isn't as famous
156:39
as Dickens but he's very popular because
156:42
he's a great storyteller his stories are
156:45
about adventure danger and horror his
156:49
heroes are pure and his villains are
156:51

what are his best-known books there's a
156:55
children's book called Treasure Island
156:57
and there's a travel story about going
157:00
around France but the most famous is the

157:10
known characters yes the book was an
157:13
immediate success it's about a man who
157:15
has two sides to his character one good
157:19
and one bad the man dr. Jekyll has a
157:22
battle inside himself between his good
157:25
side and his evil side this is the
157:28
psychological idea of someone with a
157:31
split personality yes in everyday speech
157:34
we say about someone oh he's a real
157:37
Jekyll and Hyde meaning there are two
157:40
sides to their personality fascinating

questioned the doctor replied in a
161:12
strange wild voice that mr. Hyde had
161:16
gone forever six over the next few weeks
161:25
dr. Jekyll's behavior became more and
161:28
more unusual he locked himself in his

his servants were worried when they
161:37

162:53
to mr. Utterson in it dr. Jekyll tried
162:59
to explain himself he said he believed
163:02
that inside every human being there was
163:06
a good side and an evil side nine Jekyll
163:15
had created a potion when he drank it
163:18
his whole body changed god help me

the good kind doctor became cruel ugly
163:35
and evil he called this other man mr.
163:39
Hyde to change back he had to drink
163:42
another potion ten but after a time
163:54
Jekyll found that he liked changing into
163:58
mr. Hyde he enjoyed being bad he became
164:02
more and more violent and cruel he took
164:17
pleasure in hurting innocent people
164:20
[Music]
164:30
eleven finally dr. Jekyll couldn't
164:35
control mr. Hyde any more he began to
164:39
change into this monster even without
164:42
taking the potion Jekyll hoped and
164:45
prayed that Hyde would disappear god
164:49
help me but Hyde always returned
164:57
[Laughter]
165:02

12.8 Tony's life well he's not much good
205:07
at anything he hasn't had a job since he
205:10
left school
205:11
so he hasn't got any money so he can't
205:13
buy any new clothes he never looked
205:15
smart and he doesn't know what kind of
205:18
job he wants he's not ambitious at all
205:21
so he doesn't apply for many jobs I
205:24
think the problem is that he's lazy he
205:27
doesn't get up till midday and he
205:29
doesn't shave he doesn't even shower
205:32
often he doesn't look good maybe that's
205:36
why he hasn't got a girlfriend he's

useless tapescript 12.9 if Tony had a
205:45
job if Tony had a job he'd have some

money if he had some money he could buy
205:53
some new clothes if he had some nice
205:57
clothes he'd look smarter if he was a
206:02
bit more ambitious he would apply for
206:04
more jobs if he weren't so lazy he'd get
206:09
up before midday if he shaved and
206:12
showered more he'd look better if he
206:17
looked better he might get a girlfriend

scripts 12.10 one Jimmy's problem Amy
206:31
can I talk to you for a minute sure what
206:35
about well I've got a bit of a problem
206:37
you know I'm in my first year at
206:40
University I'm really enjoying the
206:42
course I love what I'm doing studying
206:44
physics but I was waiting for a but yes
206:47
you're right I'm also in a band there
206:50
are three of us and we've been playing
206:52
together for a couple of years and we
206:54
just got a cording contract which is
206:56
something we've been trying to get for
206:58
ages and you can't do both is that it
207:02
absolutely the other guys want me to
207:05
drop her of university if the record was
207:07
a success we'd go on tour we might go to
207:11
Europe for three months or we might even
207:13
get to America that would be amazing but
207:16
if you dropped out of university and the
207:18
band wasn't a success then what would
207:21
you do exactly that's the problem but
207:25
if I didn't give the band a chance I'd
207:27
regret it for the rest of my life this
207:30
is our one big chance but if the band
207:34
didn't work you wouldn't have a career
207:36
and my parents would go crazy Amy help
207:41
me what do I do
207:43
well I think you should try with the
207:47
band if it doesn't work it's not the end
207:50
of the world you could always go back to
207:53
University and you might hit the big
207:56
time in the music business - Fiona's
208:02
problem Jenny you've got to help me what
208:07
is it are you all right
208:09
yes I'm fine but I'm having terrible
208:11
boyfriend trouble what with Sam I
208:15
thought you two were fine we are sort of
208:18
and very fond of Sam we've been going
208:21
out for over a year and we do things
208:24
together but but that but I've met this
208:28
guy at work and he's asked me out and I
208:31
don't know what to do wow this is sudden
208:36
well not really the thing is everyone
208:40
thinks that Sam and I are a couple and
208:42
we're going to get married but for me
208:44
Sam is more like a brother I can't marry
208:47
him if I married Sam I'd be so unhappy
208:51
but if I broke up with him he would be
208:54
heartbroken I don't know what he'd do
208:57
but it sounds like you have to say
208:59
something if you don't tell him now it
209:02
might be worse later who's this man at
209:06
work well he's really lovely his name's
209:10
Harry he's my age and he's very
209:13
good-looking we work together and it's
209:16
such fun he really makes me laugh
209:20
he isn't pushing me to go out with him
209:22
but but you'd really like to I know and
209:27
if I don't say anything to him he might
209:29
think I don't like him so what do I do
209:34
well if I were you
209:36
I
209:37
say anything to this guy at work yet
209:39
would be nice to him but don't encourage
209:43
him but he might go out with another
209:45
girl if he started going out with
209:48
another girl then you know what sort of
209:50
man he was if he likes you he'll wait
209:54
but you have to talk to Sam first tape
210:00
scripts 12 point 11 a year later Jimmy
210:06
well we made a record and we went on
210:09
tour to Japan and the band's doing
210:12
really not bad we haven't had the big
210:14
time but we've had one or two hits and
210:17
we're very well known in some parts of
210:19
the world we haven't been to America yet
210:21
but we hope to soon and my parents have
210:24
been ok well my mother has my father
210:28
keeps saying when are you going to get a
210:29
real job but he doesn't approve of
210:32
anything I do so that's nothing new so
210:34
it was the right decision
210:38
Fiona well I told Sam and in fact he was
210:43
fine about it he also said that he
210:47
thought we were more like brother and
210:48
sister I was quite upset that it wasn't
210:52
more upset anyway he was alright about
210:56
it and of course all our friends said
210:58
that they had seen this all along so I
211:02
broke up with Sam and it didn't work out
211:05
with Harry at all it turned out that he
211:07
was engaged to a lovely French girl and
211:10
he was just being friendly with me so I
211:12
got the situation completely wrong never
211:16
mind I'm single but that's fine I'll
211:19
just see what happens

generally I am optimistic about the
211:34
future if you go back to the beginning
211:37
of the 19th century most Americans lived
211:40
for about 50 years
211:42
nowadays life expectancy is nearly 80
211:46
years this is because of great
211:49
improvements in health care and
211:51
technology there's no reason why this
211:55
won't continue far into the 21st century
211:58
the world has changed so much in the
212:02
last 20 years we have DNA microchips and
212:07
the internet we must teach people to use
212:11
this new technology I believe that one
212:15
day everybody will have computers and
212:18
access to the Internet for over 2,000
212:23
years we have tried to understand our
212:26
environment
212:27
now we are beginning to control it as
212:30
well we are learning how to control the
212:33
weather and one day we'll learn to
212:36
control earthquakes and volcanoes
212:40
eventually illness and disease will not
212:43
exist because we will build new body
212:46
parts new livers kidneys hearts lungs
212:51
like spare parts for a car
212:54
people say well population is an
212:57
increasing problem but if people become
213:00
more educated and richer they won't need
213:04
or want to have so many children and the
213:07
population of many countries will
213:09
decrease I believe that one day there
213:14
will be a world government because the
213:17
resources of the world will have to be
213:19
managed at a global level we need to
213:23
make global decisions we already have a
213:27
world language called English and there
213:31
is now a worldwide communication system

213:43
I do have some reasons to be pessimistic
213:47
I think people will remain fundamentally
213:51
the same there will always be stupid
213:55
people as well as intelligent people
213:58
there will always be cruel people who
214:01
want to fight and wage wars there will
214:05
be people who don't understand that we
214:07
have to look after our world our forests
214:10
our oceans our atmosphere there will
214:14
certainly always be people who think
214:17
that money is everything we have the
