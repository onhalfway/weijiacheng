### T3.8 Song Extract from 20-something by Jamie Cullum

### T3.9 Dr Susan Hall - The work-life balance

Of course, work is important for us all, it gives us money to live, it gives structure to our everyday lives. But, for a happy, balanced life, it's also important to 'play' sometimes. It's important to find time to relax with friends and family. It's not good to think about work all the time. I know from my work as a doctor that it's sometimes difficult **not to** take your work problems home - but if you take your problems home you never relax, and it's difficult for your family, and bad for your health. **Don't live to work, work to live! Life is more than work.** 不要为了工作而生活，要为了生活而工作!生活比工作更重要。

Duncan told me that his mother was an excellent cook - and he was right. I also enjoyed our walk - the countryside and woods near your house are beautiful.
- The journey back was long and I slept for most of the way. It was very kind of you to drive me to the station so early in the morning. I was very grateful!
- It's good to be back at university. I have a lot of work at the moment before the exams start. I know Duncan has exams too, so we can't see each other until the end of June - we are just too busy!

  - The second thing to say is that the people are very, very enthusiastic. Life isn't easy in Mumbai for a lot of people, but we really work hard and we really want to do our best. Every new day brings new possibilities! The future is exciting for us!

- Lourdes from Mexico City
  - There are three things I like about living in Mexico City. First, the weather. It is warm and sunny most of the year. The second is the fresh fruit and vegetables - the markets are wonderful, the colours and smells are great! And the third is that I'm never bored because there is so much to see and do! We have museums, theatres, art exhibitions, parks, restaurants, bars ... everything!
  - My favourite time of year in Mexico City is the end of December, from the 16th to the 3lst. The city is full of lights, there are parties everywhere, and we eat and drink and give presents. Everyone's really happy! I love it!
