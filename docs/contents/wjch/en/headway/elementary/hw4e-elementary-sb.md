## Unit 9 City living

### T9.1 City living

- 1 This city is in the south-east of the country. It's very big, and very old. It's about 50 kilometres from the sea and it's on a famous river, the River Thames
- 2 This city is in the north and centre of the country. It's about 200 kilometres from the sea and it's on the River Seine. It's one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.

### T9.2 see p70

### T9.3

- 1 The Eiffel Tower is taller than the Gherkin.

### T9.4

Well, I like both London and Paris. But they are very different cities. Take transport for example. The Metro is cheaper and easier to use than the Underground. And the weather ... well, Paris is certainly hotter than London. And Paris, in fact, is wetter than London; but in London there are more wet days. What about the buildings? Well, ... people say that the architecture in Paris is more beautiful, but the buildings in London are more interesting. And living in the two cities? Well . .. life is faster in London. And the people? ... Mmm, Londoners are generally more polite than Parisians. People in London work harder, and they earn more. In Paris, having a good time is more important.

- Some time in 2008. for the first time in the history of the world, more people on earth lived in cities than in rural areas.

### T9.11

- Makiko from Tokyo
  - The first thing to say about Tokyo is that it is very safe. Women can walk everywhere anytime day or night. Little children walk to school. You can leave something on the table in a restaurant while you go out for a minute and nobody will take it.
  - Tokyo is also very clean, and it is very easy to travel around. All the trains and buses run on time.
  - Personally, my favourite time of year is spring, when it's dry and the cherry blossom is out.
  - Tokyo is a very exciting city, because there are always new things to do, new places to go, new things to eat. It changes very quickly!

- Vimahl from Mumbai
  - I have two strong impressions of Mumbai.
  - First, it is a city that is so full of activity! It is busy busy busy all day long and all night long!
  - It's a city that doesn't sleep much. The day begins early because it is so hot. It's a noisy place. There are cars going beep beep, auto rickshaws by the thousand, fast trains rushing past, vendors shouting and trying to get you to buy their food, their drinks, their clothes. And people, people everywhere trying to get to work.
  - The second thing to say is that the people are very, very enthusiastic. Life isn't easy in Mumbai for a lot of people, but we really work hard and we really want to do our best. Every new day brings new possibilities! The future is exciting for us!

- Lourdes from Mexico City
  - There are three things I like about living in Mexico City. First, the weather. It is warm and sunny most of the year. The second is the fresh fruit and vegetables - the markets are wonderful, the colours and smells are great! And the third is that I'm never bored because there is so much to see and do! We have museums, theatres, art exhibitions, parks, restaurants, bars ... everything!
  - My favourite time of year in Mexico City is the end of December, from the l6th to the 3lst. The city is full of lights, there are parties everywhere, and we eat and drink and give presents. Everyone's really happy! I love it!

- Oats and beans and barley grow
- As you and I and everyone knows,
- Oats and beans and barley grows
- As you and I and everyone knows,
- A-waiting for a partner.
- First the farmer sows his seeds,
- Then he stands and takes his ease.
- Stamps his feet and claps his hands
- And turns around to view his lands
- A-waiting for a partner
- Now you're married you must obey,
- Must be true in all you say,
- Must be kind and must be good
- And help your wife to chop the wood,
- A-waiting for a partner
- Oats and beans and barley grow
- As you and I and everyone knows,
- Oats and beans and barley grows
- As you and I and everyone knows,
- A-waiting for a partner.

### T12.5 Tense revision

- Lara
- I'm really excited about my trip to Europe. I haven't travelled much outside Australia before. Just once, two years ago, I went on holiday to Bali with my family but I've never been to Europe or the US. I often travel inside Australia. Last year I flew to Perth to visit my cousin, who lives there. It's a five-hour flight from Sydney, where I live. Australia's a big country! Also, I've been up to Cairns in the north three times. I learned to scuba dive there on the Great Barrier Reef.
- We've just finished packing, and now we're waiting for the taxi to take us to the airport. I've never flown on a 747 before.It's a very long flight. It takes 20 hours to get to Rome. I'm going to watch films all the way. I can't wait!

### T12.7 Song: Turin Brakes -They can't buy the sunshine

### T12.8

- 1 Elsa from Birmingham, England
  - OK, I've been to Glastonbury five times now. My highlights this year were: pear cider to drink, and the American diner van with the best sausages and chips ever. However, I was very disappointed with the music on Saturday night. Dls played House music all night. I love House but this was rubbish. I got really bored, so I went back to my tent to finish a bottle of pear cider with friends!
    - cider /ˈsaɪdə(r)/ n. 苹果酒；苹果汁; 复数 ciders
    - Pear Cider 梨酒, 青梨苹果酒, 梨子酒

- 2 Daniel Evans from Wales
  - Last Wednesday at 2.30 in the afternoon, I decided that I wanted to go to Glastonbury. I was lucky! I found a ticket on the Glastonbury message boards. I'm so glad I went. The music was brilliant. Sometimes it took a long time to get to the stages.The queues were long but always friendly. In the busy "real world" it's difficult to have good conversations with people. At Glastonbury you can do this. It's a great festival, with a great crowd of people. What more could you want? 100,000 friendly people. I wish the rest of life was the same! Four days out of 365 is a good start!
