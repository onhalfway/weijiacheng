- Makiko from Tokyo
  - The first thing to say about Tokyo is that it is very safe. Women can walk everywhere anytime day or night. Little children walk to school. You can leave something on the table in a restaurant while you go out for a minute and nobody will take it.
  - Tokyo is also very clean, and it is very easy to travel around. All the trains and buses run on time.
  - Personally, my favourite time of year is spring, when it's dry and the cherry blossom is out.
  - Tokyo is a very exciting city, because there are always new things to do, new places to go, new things to eat. It changes very quickly!

- Vimahl from Mumbai
  - I have two strong impressions of Mumbai.
  - First, it is a city that is so full of activity! It is busy busy busy all day long and all night long!
  - It's a city that doesn't sleep much. The day begins early because it is so hot. It's a noisy place. There are cars going beep beep, auto rickshaws by the thousand, fast trains rushing past, vendors shouting and trying to get you to buy their food, their drinks, their clothes. And people, people everywhere trying to get to work.
  - The second thing to say is that the people are very, very enthusiastic. Life isn't easy in Mumbai for a lot of people, but we really work hard and we really want to do our best. Every new day brings new possibilities! The future is exciting for us!

- Lourdes from Mexico City
  - There are three things I like about living in Mexico City. First, the weather. It is warm and sunny most of the year. The second is the fresh fruit and vegetables - the markets are wonderful, the colours and smells are great! And the third is that I'm never bored because there is so much to see and do! We have museums, theatres, art exhibitions, parks, restaurants, bars ... everything!
  - My favourite time of year in Mexico City is the end of December, from the l6th to the 3lst. The city is full of lights, there are parties everywhere, and we eat and drink and give presents. Everyone's really happy! I love it!

The music was brilliant. Sometimes it took a long time to get to the stages.The queues were long but always friendly. In the busy "real world" it's difficult to have good conversations with people. At Glastonbury you can do this. It's a great festival, with a great crowd of people. What more could you want? 100,000 friendly people. I wish the rest of life was the same!

little children walk to school you can
131:51
leave something on the table in a
131:53
restaurant while you go out for a minute
131:55
and nobody will take it Tokyo is also
132:00
very clean and it is very easy to travel
132:03
around all the trains and buses run on
132:07
time personally my favorite time of year
132:11
is spring when it's dry and the cherry
132:15
blossom is out Tokyo is a very exciting
132:19
city because there are always new things
132:23
to do new places to go new things to eat
132:27
it changes very quickly we my from
132:33
Mumbai I have two strong impressions of
132:37
Mumbai first it is a city that is so
132:40
full of activity it is busy busy busy
132:44
all day long and all night long it's a
132:48
city that doesn't sleep much the day
132:51
begins early because it is so hot it's a
132:55
noisy place
132:56
there are cars going beep beep auto
132:59
rickshaws by the thousand fast trains
133:02
rushing past vendors shouting and trying
133:06
to get you to buy their food their
133:08
drinks their clothes and people people
133:12
everywhere trying to get to work
133:15
the second thing to say is that the
133:18
people are very very enthusiastic life
133:22
isn't easy in Mumbai for a lot of people
133:24
but we really work hard and we really
133:28
want to do our best every new day brings
133:31
new possibilities the future is exciting
133:35
for us lourdes from mexico city there
133:42
are three things i like about living in
133:45
mexico city
133:46
first the weather it is warm and sunny
133:51
most of the year the second is the fresh
133:54
fruit and vegetables the markets are
133:57
wonderful the colors and smells are
134:00
great and the third is that I'm never
134:04
bored because there is so much to see
134:07

134:11
exhibitions parks restaurants bars
