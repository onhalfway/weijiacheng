- 6 Who do you think probably wrote this passage? An Ameircan, a British or a Chinese? Why?
  - I think this passage was probably written by a British, as the passage is mainly about the British Sandwich Week and other tings about the sandwich in England.

## 8.9 The chef who can't eat his own food

- Page 52
- A chef with a fear of food eats only biscuits.

- ANDREW FORSTER is a chef in an Italian restaurant in the north of England.
- He makes delicious food - fish dishes, sauces, pasta, and desserts - but he can't eat any of it. He has a fear of food. 'When I was 18 months old I stopped eating,' says Andrew, the 27-year-old chef at the Sale Pepe Restaurant in County Durham. 'Doctors told my mother to give me nothing to see what I would eat, but I only ate biscuits.'

  - 我很清楚什么食物配在一起最好吃。
- This fear makes life difficult for Andrew and his girlfriend, Caroline Lister. 'We can't go out for meals with friends,' she says. 'And we can't go to friends' weddings either. Andrew would like to eat everything like other people, but it's not possible.'
  - Caroline /'kærəlɪn/ n. 凯若琳（女子名）

## Going to a restaurant (Chaowai)

- Daniel去餐厅.mp4
- hw4e_elem_sbu08-Daniel去餐厅.mp3
- All right, hello everyone, today's topic, **rather** this week's topic is 'Going to a restaurant'. You can see, this is Part one. We have five parts. Now over these videos, I will give you a little of sample sentences. I hope that you will write these sentences down and learn them. All right, that is your homework, I trust you to do it. All right, so in the first part, we will talk about how to choose a restaurant. So, how to talk to a friend and decide which restaurant would you like to go to. There are three ways that we do this.
  - rather /ˈrɑːðə(r)/ adv. 宁可，宁愿；相当；**准确地说**；或多或少地; conj. 而不是; int. 当然啦（回答问题时用）

### Part one: Choosing a restaurant

- Page 1
- In part one, we will talk about how to choose a restaurant in English.
- We do this by:
  - 1 Choosing a **specific food** we want to eat
  - 2 Choosing a **country** whose food we want to eat
  - 3 Choosing a **flavor** we'd like to eat
- So... we're hungry. Where should we go?

- Firstly, we choose a specific food we want to eat. Oh now, I really want pizza, I really want burgers.
- Number two, we choose a country whose food we want to eat. Oh, I really want some Chinese food.
- Or three, choosing a flavor we'd like to eat. Emm, I really want something sweet.

- Page 2
- 1 Choosing a specific food we'd like to eat.
- This one is quite easy. Just say what you feel like eating.
  - "I really want some (pizza)."
  - "I feel like some (fried rice)."
  - "I could go for some (soup rice) right now."
  - "Some (salad) would sure hit the spot!" 
    - hit the spot 使人满足；正合需要；恰到好处

- We need some examples. You can put almost (here list) into these gaps.
  - Fried chicken, Omelet n. 煎蛋卷；炒鸡蛋；鸡蛋烧, Pizza, Kebab 英 /kɪˈbæb/  美 /kɪˈbɑːb/ n. （印）烤肉串；烤腌羊肉串（等于kabob）；复数 kebabs, Fish, Steak, Pasta, Rice, Soup, Broth /brɔːθ/ n. 肉汤；液体培养基；复数 brothes, Tossed salad, Dressing

- Page 3
- 2 Choosing a country/area whose food we want to eat.
- For this we use the demonym (区域居民称谓词, demo = people)
  - Chinese, Mexican, French, Italian, German, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, Filipino, American, Korean, Spanish
  - Cantonese 粤菜, Sichuanese 川菜, Hunanese 湘菜

- Page 4
- 3 Choosing a flavor we'd like to eat.
  - "I feel like something ()"
    - sweet, savory, spicy, sour, light
  - Or mention a key ingredient you'd like to eat
    - meat, vegetables, rice, noodles

- Page 5
- Other phrasings you can use:
  - "I haven't had (Chinese food) in a long time."
  - "I wouldn't mind trying (Indian food)."
  - "Let's try something new. How about (Indonesian food)."
  - "Let's just go wherever is closest."
  - "I don't care where we go, so long as it's not expensive."

### Part two: Making a reservation

- Page 6
- Restaurants that are very nice or very popular will require people to make a reservation. 预约
- At less popular restaurants, you can be seated without a reservation. 在不太受欢迎的餐馆里，你可以不预订而就坐。
- As we talked about previously, some restaurants only serve food "to go"

- Page 7
- Making restaurants reservations in English should be thought of as a **polite conversation** about what the customer needs.
  - Date and time
  - Number of people who are going
  - Special requirements
  - Customer's name and phone number

- Page 8
- H: Hi, I'd like to make a reservation please.
- R: Sure. Which day and at what time would you like to make the reservation?
- H: This Friday at 7 PM.
- R: And how many people will you be coming with?
- H: There are six of us.
- R: OK. Can I have a name for the reservation, please?
- H: Harold. Harold Jones.
- H: Oh, I almost forgot. Can we have a table near a window, please? And in a non-smoking section?
- R: Our restaurant is entirely non smoking. We can't promise you a window seat, but we'll do our best.
- H: Thank you. If a window seat is unavailable, then anything that's not too close to the kitchen will be fine.
- H: One last question: what's parking like at the restaurant?
- R: We have a parking lot behind the restaurant, and there's also space on the street for parking if you need it. Do any of the guests have special needs?
- H: Oh, yes! One of us is bringing a baby. Would you be able to provide a high chair?
- R: That won't be a problem.

- Page 9
- In restaurants without reservations, all you need to do is ask for a table.
  - "Hi can we get a table for three, please?"
- You may have to wait for other customers to finish their meals and leave, or if you have a lot of people you may have to wait for a larger table to become available.

### part four: Ordering

- Page 10
- In this part, we'll discuss ordering at a restaurant.
- Once you've looked at the menu and decided what you'd like to order, all you need to do is politely ask for it. Easy.
- But the waiter/worker might ask you some questions about your order. Perhaps you have questions for them. Not as easy.

- Page 11
- Firstly, remember to always use polite language.
  - Can I/could I
    - Can I have a Coke, please?
    - Could I get the chicken soup with toast, please?
  - would like 
    - I would like a latte with no sugar, thanks.
      - latte /ˈlɑːteɪ; ˈlæteɪ/ n. 牛奶；拿铁咖啡（coffee latte）
    - I'd like a ham and cheese sandwich, please.

- Page 12
- The person working behind the counter will almost always begin with a hello.
- Sometimes, they'll also ask how you are. Even at McDonald's, it's very friendly.
- Just say hello back. If they ask how you are, say "fine, thanks!"

- Page 13
- Remember your tone of voice
- If the waiter asks you if you'd like something, usually we say "yes, please" or "no, thank you"
- But if you have a nice, friendly tone of voice you could also say yeah, yep, mmm, nah.

- Page 14
- Have here or take away?
- We talked about this one already.
- Take away or take out means to leave with the food and eat it elsewhere.
- At nice restaurants where you sit down for your meals, you won't be asked this. Places like McDonald's and KFC will ask you this.

- Page 15
- If you aren't sure, you can ask the wait staff for suggestions.
  - "What would you recommend?"
  - "What would you suggest?"
  - "What's the best thing on the menu?"
  - "What's your favorite thing on the menu?"
- This is a weird thing to ask at McDonald's though.

- Page 16
- Be prepared for them to ask you further questions.
  - Would you like anything else?
  - What would you like to drink with that?
    - Coffee, tea, juice, Coke, etc.
  - How would you like your eggs?
    - Scrambled? 炒 Fried? 煎、炸 Poached? 水煮
    - Scrambled egg：炒蛋
    - Fried eggs ：煎鸡蛋
    - Poached egg：荷包蛋
    - Boiled egg：煮蛋
    - Fried eggs on both sides：双面煎鸡来蛋
    - over eggs：煎两面荷包蛋
    - sunny side up：煎一面荷包蛋
    - over easy eggs：煎半熟蛋 （蛋黄微熟）
    - over medium eggs（蛋黄半生熟）
    - over hard eggs：煎全熟蛋 （蛋黄全熟）
  - Any sides with that? 要什么配菜吗? (Will that be all? 就要这些吗?)
  - How do you take your coffee?
    - With sugar? Milk/cream? Hot/iced?

### Part three: Menu

- All right, we are at a restaurant, we're sitting down at the table and we're looking at the menu.

- Page 17
- If you read a menu in English, you'll notice there are several different categories for food.
  - Starter: small dish served before the meal (UK)
  - Appetizer: small dish served before the meal (US)
  - Entrée: /ˈɒntreɪ/ served before the main meal (UK)
  - Entrée: /ˈɑːntreɪ/ the main meal (US) 
  - Main: the main (largest) meal. Usually has meat. (because meats fill you up. Right, if you'd want to have a small plate of vegetables for your main meal.)
  - Side: something to be eaten with the main dish
  - Dessert: Ice cream, cakes, other sweet things
  - Drinks: You know what drinks are

- Page 18
- If you're confused about the Entrée, don't worry. It confuses me too.
- If it helps, and Entrée is usually bigger than an appetizer or starter. That's why it got confused with the main course in American English.
- It comes from a French word meaning "enter", which is why it's one of the first courses. (unless in America, that is the main meal.)

- Page 19
- Sides are something we have with the main dish.
- They are put either on one side of the plate, or on a separate plate next to your main dish.
- Some meals will have a side salad or options for the customer to add things "on the side".
  - "I'll have the steak please, with fried potatoes on the side."

- Page 20
- Even more confusingly, starters and appetizers can also used as sides, because they're smaller dishes.
- Sometimes people will order mains for them selves, plus some starters/appetizers/sides to share together.
- Just remember!
  - Starters, appetizers, sides = SMALL
  - Main = LARGE

- Page 21
- On the left, you can see the mains broken down into categories.
- On the right, mains are called Entrées. There's also a kid's menu.

### Part five: Paying for your food

- Page 22
- Last but not least 最后重要一点: Paying for your food.
- The final part, of course "Paying for your food", you don't get food for free for a restaurant.
- Some places will make you pay for your food before they serve it to you. At some places you pay after the meal.
- Usually, places where you sit down to eat will have you pay after the meal, because there's a good chance you'll order more before you finish.

- Page 23
- When you have finished your meal and want to pay, you can say:
  - Could I have the check please?
  - Could we get the bill please?
  - We'd like to pay now, please.
  - We're ready for the bill now.
  - We're ready to pay the bill/check now.
- Bill/check (America) = 单

- Page 24
- Sometimes the bill is brought to you. Other times you will have to go to the front counter to pay.
- You will be asked how you want to pay.
- Cash and bank cards are the most common ways to pay. Mobile payment services like WeChat and Alipay aren't very popular yet.

- Page 25 SPLIT THE BILL
- If many people are eating together, then paying the bill can be a little bit awkward.
- Unlike China where people fight to pay the bill, Westerners prefer it if the cost is shared fairly.

- Page 26 SPLIT THE BILL
- One option is to split the bill, which means everyone pays the same amount. This is good if you all ate and drank the same amount of food.
- But if you had an appetizer and a glass of water, you don't want to pay the same as your friends who had large meals and many drinks.

- Page 27 SEPARATE CHECKS
- Another option is to get separate checks. This means each person gets a bill for the food and drink that they ordered.
- This is fair, but it creates more work for the people at the restaurant, especially if you have a lot of people. If they have to go and make 10 different checks, they probably won't be happy!

- Page 28 MOBILE PAYMENTS
- Thankfully, mobile payments are slowly becoming popular. Apps like Venmo and Apple Pay mean only one person has to get the check and everyone else can pay them back.
- Send money and make purchases.
