T6.ll The businessman ant the fisherman
B = Businessman F = Fisherman
B Good morning. What beautiful tuna! How long did it take to catch them?
F Oh, about two hours.
B Only two hours! Amazing! Why didn't you fish for longer and catch more?
F I didn't want to fish for longer. With this I have enough fish for my family.
B But what do you do with the rest of your day? Aren't you bored?
F I'm never bored. I get up late, play with my children, watch football, and take a siesta with my wife. Sometimes in the evenings, I walk to the village to see my friends, play the guitar, and sing some songs.
B Really? That's all you do? Look, I am a very successful businessman. I went to Harvard University and I studied business. I can help you. Fish for four hours every day and sell the extra fish you catch ...
F But...
B ... Then, you can buy a bigger boat, catch more, and earn more money.
F But...
B ... Then buy a second boat, a third, and so on, until you have a big fleet of fishing boats.
F But...
B ... and you can export the fish, and leave this village, and move to Mexico City, or LA or New York, and open a fishing business.
F OK, OK, but how long will all this take?
B Er- let me think -er probably about 15 to 20 years.
F 15 to 20 years! And then what, Senor?
B Why, that's the exciting part! You can sell your business and become very rich, a millionaire.
F A millionaire? Really? But what do I do with all the money?
B Well, Iet me think. Erm- I know you can stop work, and -er, move to a lovely, old fishing village where you can sleep late, play with your grandchildren, watch football, take a siesta with your wife, and walk to the village in the evenings where you can play the guitar, and sing with your friends all vou want.
F Mmmm - well ...
