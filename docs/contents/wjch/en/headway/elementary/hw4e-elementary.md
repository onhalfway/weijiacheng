- B Good morning. What beautiful tuna! How long did it take to catch them?
- F Oh, about two hours.
- B Only two hours! Amazing! Why didn't you fish for longer and catch more?
- F I didn't want to fish for longer. With this I have enough fish for my family.
- B But what do you do with the rest of your day? Aren't you bored?
- F I'm never bored. I get up late, play with my children, watch football, and take a siesta with my wife. Sometimes in the evenings, I walk to the village to see my friends, play the guitar, and sing some songs.
- B Really? That's all you do? Look, I am a very successful businessman. I went to Harvard University and I studied business. I can help you. Fish for four hours every day and sell the extra fish you catch ...
- F But...
- B ... Then, you can buy a bigger boat, catch more, and earn more money.
- F But...
- B ... Then buy a second boat, a third, and so on, until you have a big fleet of fishing boats.
- F But...
- B ... and you can export the fish, and leave this village, and move to Mexico City, or LA or New York, and open a fishing business.
- F OK, OK, but how long will all this take?
- B Er- let me think -er probably about 15 to 20 years.
- F 15 to 20 years! And then what, Senor?
- B Why, that's the exciting part! You can sell your business and become very rich, a millionaire.
- F A millionaire? Really? But what do I do with all the money?
- B Well, Iet me think. Erm- I know you can stop work, and -er, move to a lovely, old fishing village where you can sleep late, play with your grandchildren, watch football, take a siesta with your wife, and walk to the village in the evenings where you can play the guitar, and sing with your friends all you want.
- F Mmmm - well ...
- Fisherman's children Papa, Papa, did you catch many fish?
- F I caught enough for us today and tomorrow, and also some for this gentleman. Please, Senor, have some of my beautiful fish. Goodbye Senor. Come on children,let's go home.

- 'But what do you do with the rest of your day? Aren't you bored?'
- The fisherman smiled,' I'm never bored. I get up (late), play with my children, watch football, and take a siesta with my wife. Sometimes in the evenings I walk to the village to see my friends, play the guitar, a nd sings (some) songs.'
- The American couldn't understand, 'Look, I am a very successful businessman. I (went) to Harvard University and I (studied) business. I can help you. Fish for four hours every day and sell the extra fish you catch. Then, you can buy a bigger boat, catch more, and (earn) more money.

- 'And then what, Senor?' asked the fisherman.
- 'Why, that's the exciting part!' laughed the businessman.'You can sell your business and become very rich, a millionaire!'
- A millionaire? Really? But what do I do with all the money?' The young fisherman didn't look excited.
- The businessman could not understand this young man. 'Well, you can (stop) work and move to a lovely, old fishing village where you can sleep late, play with your grandchildren, watch football, take a siesta with your wife, and walk to the village in the evenings where you can play the guitar, and sing with your friends all you want.'
- The fisherman's wife and children came running to meet him.
- 'Papa, papa (did) you catch many fish?'
- 'I (caught) enough for us today and tomorrow, and some for this gentleman' said their father. He gave the businessman some fish, thanked him for his advice and went home with his family.
