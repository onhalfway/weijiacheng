we live in an increasingly mobile world
00:14
today more than at any time in the past
00:17
we are in the position of being able to
00:20
travel wherever we want whenever we want
00:24
in 2012 the world hit a travel milestone
00:30
for the first time in history according
00:33
to the United Nations World Tourism
00:35
Organization more than 1 billion
00:38
tourists travelled the globe in a single
00:41
year
00:41
this figure is made even more
00:44
extraordinary by the fact that just over
00:46
60 years earlier it was only 25 million
00:50
[Music]
00:53
France was the most popular country with
00:56
over 83 million tourists visiting in one
00:59
year
01:00
[Music]
01:06
today we think very little about getting
01:08
on a plane to fly domestically to
01:10
another city in our own country or
01:12
internationally to a far-flung
01:14
destination but it's important to
01:20
remember that the first commercial
01:23
transatlantic flights didn't start until
01:25
the 1950s and for a long time flying was
01:29
a time-consuming and expensive business
01:31
that simply wasn't accessible to
01:34
everyday people technology fuels the
01:38
development of international transports
01:40
but even more significantly it is also
01:42
transforming the experience of
01:44
international travel and communication
01:46
beyond all recognition in the past for
01:51
those who traveled internationally for
01:53
leisure or to live and work in another
01:55
country communicating with family and
01:58
friends back home was a challenge but
02:03
today it's now nearly as easy to stay in
02:06
touch with a friend living or traveling
02:08
on the other side of the world as the
02:10
one standing next to you as a result of
02:14
all these technological changes the
02:17
world has become what we call a global
02:19
village people travel widely and often
02:22
live in countries far from their loved
02:24
ones how about you do you have many
02:27
friends and family living overseas yes I
02:31
should a quite a few of them around
02:34
Europe almost and every single country
02:37
in Europe the well known countries such
02:39
as Germany Holland Sweden Belgium
02:41
Switzerland England Ireland I have a
02:47
huge number of friends living in New
02:49
York at the moment which is why I'm
02:50
visiting for work and for pleasure and
02:53
for whole range of reasons they're over
02:55
here so I thought I would past and spend
02:57
a week in the sunshine because it is
02:59
winter back home in Melbourne yes I do
03:02
loads of family in the Philippines North
03:06
America and all over Europe
03:09
I have a lot of family in Jersey which
03:12
is one of the Channel Islands but apart
03:15
from that I have some friends who live
03:17
in Europe but not outside of the
03:20
continent
03:23
[Music]
03:33
it is now estimated that nearly 80% of
03:36
the world's population has access to a
03:39
mobile phone it is thought that in under
03:42
two years there will be more mobile
03:44
phones than people on the planet with
03:47
smartphones that can connect to the
03:49
Internet and the explosion of social
03:51
media sites like Twitter Facebook and
03:54
Instagram there are more and more ways
03:56
to stay in touch with your family and
03:58
friends wherever they live so many of
04:03
these developments have happened so
04:04
quickly it has become increasingly
04:06
difficult to remember how we
04:08
communicated before and for some people
04:11
it's almost impossible to imagine how we
04:14
would manage without internet and mobile
04:16
communications how about you how do you
04:20
communicate with people overseas
04:23
generally both Skype has this changed
04:26
over time yes it has changed over time
04:29
it used to be letters and telephone
04:33
calls and now it's email and Skype can
04:36
you imagine a world without
04:37
internet-based communication now no my
04:40
it's my job and I need the internet to
04:42
work how do you communicate with friends
04:45
and family overseas yeah there's a whole
04:47
range of different methods you can use
04:50
to keep in touch with your friends and
04:51
family when they're overseas
04:52
I would predominantly use things like
04:55
Facebook and email and Skype for my more
04:59
media savvy friends we may use Twitter
05:01
to keep in touch
05:02
obviously Instagram is a great way of
05:05
getting an idea of what people are up to
05:07
and a snapshot of their day so yeah
05:10
there's so many tools that have just
05:11
come around in the last few years that
05:13
make keeping in touch a lot easier
05:14
that's the way that you've communicated
05:16
with friends and family changed over
05:19
time yeah it's definitely changed the
05:22
way that we keep in touch when friends
05:23
or families or overseas I think in the
05:26
past I know that when I traveled three
05:29
or four years ago the best way to get in
05:31
for home is
05:32
you'd send an email and then you send a
05:33
couple of postcards but now you just
05:36
turn the Facebook message it's interface
05:38
but updating mum and dad know where you
05:39
are so it's a lot easier and faster
05:43
could you imagine a world today without
05:45
any internet-based communications no
05:49
absolutely not
05:50
I had Wi-Fi at my apartment where I'm
05:53
saying this morning and as soon as I got
05:57
up I realized if I was going to do
05:59
anything today I needed to have internet
06:01
so the first thing I did was jump on the
06:03
train and go and get myself hooked up
06:05
with a US SIM card so that I had might
06:08
you snap my fingertips because it's
06:10
scary how lost you feel when you don't
06:13
have the internet right there at your
06:14
fingertips you feel you don't have your
06:16
maps you don't have your contacts you
06:18
don't have any of that things that keeps
06:20
you grounded and keeps you connected
06:21
with society so yeah a world without
06:24
internet is is quite foreign to me how
06:28
do you communicate with friends and
06:29
family overseas I usually speak with
06:32
them over the Internet we use Skype a
06:34
lot which is very popular these days and
06:36
a lot of e-mails back and forth has this
06:39
changed over time we've definitely
06:42
gotten more used to Skype back in the
06:44
early days Skype was pretty difficult
06:46
and the connections were bad especially
06:48
in China so we tended to use more emails
06:50
in the earlier days can you imagine a
06:53
world without internet-based
06:54
communication now I honestly cannot I
06:57
was saying to a friend the other day
06:59
that I couldn't imagine my grandfather
07:00
who's now a hundred years old never had
07:03
internet growing up and I just can't
07:06
imagine life without a smartphone and
07:07
with that without constant internet
07:09
access how do you communicate with
07:12
friends and family overseas I
07:15
communicate with them on skype and via
07:17
email and so through social networking
07:19
as well so Facebook and Twitter has how
07:22
you communicate with them changed over
07:24
time I used to communicate sometimes
07:28
through letters when I was very very
07:29
young
07:30
but yeah dominantly now through social
07:33
media which obviously is kind of a lost
07:35
years could you imagine a world today
07:37
without any internet-based
07:39
communications I think that people would
07:43
be on time because I think before when
07:46
you had only telephones in the house and
07:49
you had no internet you'd say to people
07:52
I'll meet you here at this time and you
07:53
just be there
07:54
whereas now because you can say I'm
07:57
running five minutes late I'm running
07:58
ten minutes late you've got an excuse so
08:00
I think people would be on time if we
08:01
didn't have those
08:06
[Music]
08:16
whenever surveys listing the most
08:19
livable cities in the world are
08:20
published the Canadian city of Vancouver
08:23
is usually right there at the top of the
08:26
rankings there's evidence that people
08:28
have lived in the Vancouver area for
08:31
over 10,000 years with a plentiful
08:34
supply of food in its forests and rivers
08:36
it was the perfect place for a
08:38
settlement Europeans started arriving in
08:42
the area in the mid 18th century today
08:46
the Metro Vancouver area is home to over
08:49
2.3 million people and has over 8.5
08:53
million visitors a year so what do its
09:00
residents and visitors think makes the
09:02
city such a special place I think when
09:07
ku ev-everything like the city where the
09:10
skyscrapers and stuff like that and then
09:12
the nature and here's and the sea is
09:15
like everything in one and it's so
09:18
accessible you don't need to own a car
09:20
to get out to nature I've been on a few
09:23
tours where it's a city bus and you know
09:25
a short while later you're you're out in
09:27
nature and you're out taking a hike deep
09:29
into the woods so that's what I really
09:31
like about Vancouver it seems to like
09:34
when you go around the city and you
09:35
travel around it it is very much a green
09:37
city like there there's a lot of park
09:38
space there's a lot of recycling places
09:41
where you can when you're walking down
09:43
the street you can recycle your stuff as
09:44
opposed to just throwing tin cans and
09:46
plastic into the garbage which most
09:47
other cities do well certainly there's a
09:49
kind of a friendliness to the city where
09:52
people seem open to helping each other
09:56
out and talking to strangers and things
09:58
and Vancouver just has an abundance of
10:01
things to do kind of outside of your
10:05
work life there's so many parks and
10:08
mountains and different outdoor
10:10
activities and all sorts of stuff to do
10:13
Vancouver's natural beauty is impossible
10:16
to ignore from snow-capped mountain
10:20
peaks to lush forests and beautiful bays
10:23
and beaches the scenery is stunning
10:28
and the city offers a huge variety of
10:31
activities on its doorstep all year
10:34
round you can watch Canada's national
10:36
sport of ice hockey in one of the city's
10:39
stadiums Vancouverites are passionate
10:43
about their home team
10:44
the Canucks the team have yet to win the
10:47
Stanley Cup the ultimate prize in ice
10:49
hockey but they're dedicated fans will
10:52
never give up hope you can do sailing or
10:56
kayaking on the rivers and creeks around
10:58
the city or test your nerve at the 140
11:06
meter long Capilano Suspension Bridge
11:08
that crosses 70 meters above the
11:11
Capilano River in North Vancouver
11:15
or you can just spend your days
11:17
exploring Stanley Park a short walk from
11:20
the city centre Stanley Park is one of
11:24
the biggest and most dramatic urban
11:26
parks in the world the 120 year old
11:30
green space boasts a host of attractions
11:33
and the park is also famous for its
11:36
first nation art and no visit is
11:40
complete without a photo of the
11:42
remarkable totem pole display at
11:44
Brockton point in winter residents and
11:49
visitors to the city can make the short
11:51
trip to easily accessible ski resorts
11:54
like Grouse Mountain which boasts some
11:57
of the best downhill and cross-country
11:59
skiing and snowboarding in North America
12:04
[Music]
12:06
Vancouver is a diverse and cosmopolitan
12:09
city around half of its residents are
12:12
immigrants to Canada with 25%
12:15
considering Chinese as their native
12:17
tongue and with this diversity comes
12:21
many benefits not least the amazing
12:24
variety of delicious cuisine on offer in
12:26
the city Vancouver is not complacent
12:45
about the challenges that come with
12:46
being one of the world's most desirable
12:49
destinations and Vancouver has an action
12:52
plan to become the greenest city in the
12:54
world by 2020 the greenest city plan was
13:00
put together after consultations online
13:03
through social media and face-to-face
13:05
with more than 35,000 residents of the
13:09
city the plan called on all the
13:12
residents of the city to rise to the
13:14
challenge of transforming our community
13:17
to create a better life for future
13:19
generations it sets out 10 achievable
13:24
goals for the next decade notable goals
13:27
include plans to reduce greenhouse gas
13:30
emissions by 33% to help residents make
13:33
the majority of trips by foot bicycle
13:36
and public transport and to plant a
13:39
hundred and fifty thousand new trees and
13:42
ensure that no resident lives more than
13:44
five minutes away from a green space
13:47
gwendal Castellon works for the city of
13:50
Vancouver helping to implement the plan
13:52
he explains its benefits the greenest
13:56
City action plan is a plan that
13:59
addresses many different goals related
14:01
to sustainability to try and show
14:03
leadership to differentiate the city as
14:05
a leader and attract top talent to the
14:09
city so people will see that Vancouver
14:12
is one that is really trying to be a
14:15
city that is has a lower footprint
14:18
and we'll also by being more sustainable
14:23
it also means that the city has fewer
14:27
costs it's less expensive to run a city
14:30
that is uses less energy that has a
14:34
lower impact so it's a more efficient
14:36
City as well but the economy of
14:39
Vancouver is also dependent on tourism
14:41
and tourists don't always make the most
14:44
environmentally friendly of guests
14:47
gwendal believes the city's plans could
14:50
have a far-reaching effect on its
14:52
visitors I think for when it comes to
14:57
sustainability and tourism one area
15:01
where I really see the opportunity for
15:04
global change is the idea that once
15:06
you've experienced something that's
15:08
different that really shows a you know
15:12
better practice or more conscientious
15:17
stewardship of the environment and you
15:20
go back to somewhere else and it's not
15:22
that action is not being taken you
15:24
notice it more and that's I mean that's
15:26
one of the values of travelers that you
15:29
you learn something and you bring a
15:31
little bit of that back with you we
15:33
don't want to be leaders forever we
15:35
would like that to become the new normal
15:37
as we move towards that doors goals by
15:40
2020 Vancouver will need the support of
15:44
all its residents and its visitors to
15:47
achieve its greenest city plan and it
15:50
won't be easy but just one look at the
15:54
stunning city makes you believe that
15:56
preserving this place for future
15:57
generations will be worth all the work
16:03
you
16:05
[Music]
16:15
the world of books is a changing one
16:19
more and more others are choosing to
16:21
download digital books to read on
16:23
ereader Zoar tablets
16:25
many book shops are struggling to stay
16:27
open and some people believe that the
16:30
future of printed books is under threat
16:32
[Music]
16:36
but however much the way that we read
16:39
changes there's one thing that stays the
16:41
same nothing beats a good story whether
16:46
you enjoy fiction or nonfiction sci-fi
16:50
fantasy thrillers or crime novels there
16:53
are some Universal elements that make a
16:55
good story but they're not always easy
16:58
to define so what do you think makes a
17:01
good story
17:02
I think suspense is always something for
17:06
me I like short sentences and something
17:08
that would keep me on the edge of my
17:10
seat and I'm waiting to read the next
17:12
paragraph and not being able to put it
17:13
down for me a good story is one that
17:16
sort of transports me to another place a
17:19
little bit of romance a little bit of
17:22
mystery I suppose it's always good for a
17:24
story something that makes you want to
17:25
keep reading and not put it down it
17:28
needs to have a great plot it needs to
17:29
be exciting and keep you wanting to turn
17:32
the page and keep reading but also it's
17:34
really important that the writing itself
17:36
is good and so I like to have lots of
17:39
character description and character
17:41
development and place description is
17:45
also a good thing but even if we think
17:47
that we know what makes a good read how
17:50
many of us have really considered how
17:52
you capture all these elements and turn
17:54
them into a novel that grips the reader
17:56
from the first page to the last what
17:59
does it take to write a successful novel
18:02
the saying goes that everybody has one
18:05
novel in them but how many people
18:07
believe that is true do you think that
18:10
you could ever write a novel well I
18:13
would be amazing I would love to write a
18:15
novel and I think you probably have to
18:16
have a really good idea it'd be a lot of
18:19
work Cooper one day I'd love to try
18:21
absolutely not I am NOT creative enough
18:24
nor am I good enough writer I used to
18:28
think I wanted to I used to actually
18:30
tell people I wanted to which is a big
18:32
mistake so now they ask where my famous
18:34
novel is but I don't think I have the
18:37
time and I don't think I'm motivated
18:39
enough to do it I don't really want to
18:42
anymore I think I could write a novel
18:45
I've written a book but it's not a novel
18:48
I wrote a book about the work that I do
18:51
in communication one man who knows
18:55
exactly what it takes to write a
18:57
successful novel is Tim bola
18:59
best-selling author of over 20 books for
19:02
teenagers and young adults
19:05
I'm Tim bola I'm a professional writer I
19:09
write books about people aged 14 or 15
19:12
for the most part I write novels they
19:15
vary of course my books I write about
19:17
lots of different things
19:19
I've been described as a writer of dark
19:22
brooding the stories for teenagers
19:25
I've been described as a writer of
19:28
mystical adventure stories I've been
19:31
described as the master of the
19:34
psychological thriller which was great
19:38
Tim's first novel midget was published
19:40
in 1994 in 1997 he won the prestigious
19:46
camellia medal for his novel river boy
19:48
and in 2010 he published the final
19:52
volume in his Blade series an eighth
19:55
book urban thriller Tim's work has been
19:59
translated into many languages from
20:01
German to Korean and while there may
20:05
have diverse themes Tim is clear about
20:08
what all his stories have in common
20:10
for me stage 1 the the thing you can't
20:14
do without is it's got to be a story
20:17
that keeps the reader reading I want my
20:19
readers to miss sleep miss football miss
20:22
food miss television miss Facebook for
20:26
my stories even that you know I want the
20:29
reader to just not want to stop until
20:32
they get to the end
20:36
[Music]
20:46
today Tim lives in rural West of England
20:49
and writes his novels in a small
20:51
isolated old stone building known as
20:54
Tim's bolt hole he has now been writing
20:57
for over 50 years well I started when I
21:02
was very young I was 5 years old when I
21:05
wrote my first stories but by the time I
21:08
was 19 20 I realized that writing was
21:11
not just about playtime about having fun
21:14
it was about something much deeper for
21:17
me anyway
21:18
and I started writing my first novel
21:20
just after I left University and it took
21:24
me 10 years to write the first book I
21:27
was nearly 35 when I finished it and I
21:30
wrote a lot of words to end up with a
21:32
novel which is only 50,000 words long
21:34
that one was called midget and
21:37
eventually it was published when I was
21:39
40 years old so how does Tim go about
21:43
writing a novel where does it all begin
21:45
does he start with a plan I'm not a
21:49
great planner you find some authors who
21:51
plan in detail they like down the loo
21:53
the notes about chapter 1 chapter 2 etc
21:56
then they write according to the plan
21:59
I'm not one of those there are lots of
22:02
writers like me too for me I find that
22:05
doesn't help me and that's because for
22:08
me the process of writing throws up
22:10
ideas constantly I don't really know my
22:13
characters until I start to write about
22:15
them I don't really know where my story
22:17
wants to go until I start to write it
22:20
the first part they're getting it
22:21
written part can be quick the second
22:25
part getting it right can be seemingly
22:28
endless I can spend a tenth of the time
22:31
getting it written and nine-tenths of
22:34
the time getting it right but that's
22:36
just how it is just working in the bolt
22:39
hole helped with the process of writing
22:41
his novels working in this strange
22:44
isolated place is quite interesting for
22:47
me
22:47
because I often find it it helps me when
22:51
I'm stuck because it forces me in upon
22:53
myself I can't depend on anybody else I
22:56
don't have any distractions I can't go
22:58
and watch television or play the piano
23:00
and pretend I've got something better to
23:02
do I've got to stay with the problem
23:04
James books continued to be popular both
23:07
his physical paperbacks and hardbacks
23:09
and as digital downloads and his readers
23:13
always equally anticipate the
23:15
publication of his newest novel so who
23:18
is Tim hopeful about the future of
23:20
stories and the written word people
23:23
often say that they think that the
23:24
written word is under threat from modern
23:27
technology but I just don't think that's
23:29
true
23:30
technology is with us whether it's in
23:32
the form of mobile phones or ereader or
23:35
Kindles or whatever and the way we write
23:38
the process in a way has changed when I
23:42
first started writing I used to use an
23:44
old pencil and a notebook now I use a
23:47
laptop I also went through a period of
23:50
using a typewriter but the essence of
23:54
storytelling is the same
23:55
how are you produced the written word
23:57
doesn't really matter no one buys a book
24:00
because of the way was written they buy
24:03
a book because of the end product and
24:05
that's what they come to read the story
24:07
and I don't think their written word is
24:08
under threat at all it can compete with
24:12
every other medium that's out there I
24:14
think stories have been with us for so
24:17
long that they're always going to be
24:19
with us and how they're told won't
24:20
really matter
24:25
[Music]
24:34
in the last few years the world has
24:38
experienced the most extreme weather in
24:41
living memory in Britain in 2010 the
24:45
country experienced one of the most
24:47
severe winters ever with high snowfalls
24:50
and record low temperatures the year
24:54
after was the second warmest year in 353
24:58
years and the year after that had the
25:00
wettest summer in a century then the
25:04
spring of 2013 was the coldest in 50
25:07
years so how come the famously
25:11
uninteresting British weather has
25:13
suddenly become so dramatic the Met
25:17
Office Britain's National Weather
25:19
Service held a meeting with some of the
25:22
UK's leading scientists and
25:24
meteorologists to try to answer this
25:26
question the Met Office has been
25:29
observing the weather for over a hundred
25:31
and fifty years today it is known as one
25:36
of the most accurate forecast errs in
25:38
the world but they don't just predict
25:41
the weather
25:42
they also use their data to identify
25:44
shifts in the world's climate by
25:47
collecting and analyzing data from
25:49
weather stations all over the UK and all
25:52
around the world they believe that these
25:56
extreme weather conditions are
25:58
influenced by climate change this change
26:01
is happening at an unusually fast rate
26:04
and can't be explained by the Earth's
26:06
natural cycles scientists therefore
26:09
believe climate change is almost
26:11
certainly caused by human activity this
26:15
opinion is echoed by weather experts
26:17
around the world almost all scientists
26:20
analyzing weather patterns believe that
26:22
the earth is warming and that human
26:25
activity is responsible so if nearly all
26:28
the experts agree surely there's a
26:30
consensus on the
26:32
that our activities are causing climate
26:34
change well not exactly
26:37
I'm not skeptical of the science as much
26:39
as how people interpret the science in
26:41
popular media saying that you know the
26:44
heat wave that's coming through is
26:45
because of global warming I think people
26:47
use global warming more day-to-day than
26:50
what the science actually tells you
26:53
about the incremental effect that you
26:56
know pollution and all those things is
26:57
having on day to day life around the
27:00
world I don't believe it's human caused
27:02
I do believe it exists exists and it's
27:04
definitely happening at the moment but I
27:06
think it's a cycle that's been happening
27:07
for the last few million years and it's
27:10
a natural occurrence
27:11
I do think humans are definitely
27:15
responsible for climate change I mean
27:17
it's just something that's actually
27:19
happening I think a lot of people don't
27:21
care about it some people do a lot of
27:24
people do care about it I think that
27:27
we're gonna find ways of living whether
27:30
it's there or not I think it's because
27:34
we don't totally understand it and I
27:36
think if we were educated a little bit
27:38
more on it then we wouldn't be so
27:41
skeptical as people often point out this
27:46
is not the first time that the Earth's
27:47
climate has changed so why are humans
27:52
now getting the blame and why is this
27:54
such an important issue dr. Adam corner
27:57
explains the climate has always changed
28:00
and it always will do the earth went in
28:03
and out of several ice ages long before
28:05
humans were here but the difference with
28:08
the climate change that we see at the
28:09
moment is their pace that is happening
28:12
so all things being equal we should be
28:16
very very gradually an imperceptible
28:18
rate heading towards the next ice age
28:20
but what's actually happening is that
28:22
we're racing in the other direction the
28:24
earth is getting warmer so it's the pace
28:26
of change and whether humans and other
28:28
species and the natural environment can
28:30
keep up with that pace of change that's
28:32
the question
28:35
[Music]
28:45
so when all the evidence seems to point
28:47
to one conclusion why don't some people
28:51
believe that climate change is a problem
28:54
and why do some people believe that the
28:57
public is being deliberately misinformed
28:59
about the issue my name is dr. Adam
29:02
corner I work in the School of
29:04
Psychology at Cardiff University and
29:06
also for an organization called coin
29:08
which stands for climate outreach
29:10
information network and I'm very
29:12
interested in how people understand
29:14
climate change how they think about the
29:17
risks of climate change and how to
29:19
communicate it more effectively one of
29:22
the reasons that is thought that climate
29:24
change is difficult for us to get to
29:26
grips with psychologically is that it's
29:28
a distant threat and it's distant in
29:30
several ways
29:31
so it's distant in terms of time scales
29:34
involved it's not really happening here
29:36
and now and it's also quite intangible
29:39
so we can't really touch it or smell it
29:41
or feel it most of the time what we
29:43
experience is daily weather and that's
29:45
not necessarily a good guide to the
29:47
global climate he believes that the
29:49
evidence is so overwhelming that there
29:51
should be a consensus on the existence
29:53
and causes of climate change every
29:57
science academy around the world almost
29:59
every government around the world agrees
30:01
that human activity is changing the
30:04
climate and it's changing the climate
30:06
through the release of greenhouse gases
30:08
associated with our burning of fossil
30:10
fuels oil gas things like that but
30:15
despite this strong evidence there are
30:17
some skeptics some people believe the
30:21
evidence has been exaggerated and some
30:23
even say that global warming is a
30:26
worldwide conspiracy psychologists have
30:29
been interested in measuring public
30:32
perceptions to climate change over the
30:33
last 10-15 years and over that time
30:35
there's been changes in public attitudes
30:37
but one of the things that's been fairly
30:39
consistent is there is a small group of
30:42
people it's more of a vocal group of
30:43
people who doubt the reality or the
30:46
seriousness of climate change
30:48
so perhaps they suggest that climate
30:50
change is just a ruse to tax citizens
30:52
more or something like that dr. körner
30:55
believes these in experts and untrained
30:58
conspiracy theorists are misinforming
31:01
the public especially through
31:02
unregulated media such as the internet
31:05
the great thing about the Internet is
31:07
that it does allow broader participation
31:09
in debates about critical issues like
31:12
climate change but at the same time it
31:14
can also amplify voices that perhaps
31:16
aren't as prevalent as they seem to be
31:18
when you look at blogs the idea that
31:21
climate change is a conspiracy is a view
31:23
that is only held by a small minority of
31:26
people but it is minority that's
31:29
over-represented on internet blogs dr.
31:33
Korner says that climate change skeptics
31:35
have disproportionate access to the
31:38
mainstream media to journalists
31:40
routinely seek their opinion in order to
31:43
be objective the media has been
31:46
criticized over the years for doing
31:48
something that's called presenting false
31:50
balance on climate change so there's a
31:52
norm in media reporting that if there's
31:54
a story present both sides of that story
31:56
with something like climate change
31:58
because the weight of scientific
31:59
evidence is so overwhelmingly on one
32:01
side that it is happening and that human
32:04
activity is causing climate change
32:05
presenting that view and then a
32:07
skeptical view about climate change in
32:09
opposition to it doesn't actually
32:11
reflect the reality climate change will
32:13
affect every area of our lives the way
32:16
we live the way we work and the way our
32:18
society is organized that's why we need
32:21
to make sure information on climate
32:23
change is clear and engaging and comes
32:27
from a trusted and reliable source

32:43
young people today are lazy and entitled
32:47
they expect everything for nothing and
32:50
they're allergic to hard work under 25s
32:53
not an employment education or training
32:55
to sit at home living off their parents
32:59
playing video games and not contributing
33:02
anything to society viola teenagers are
33:05
roaming the streets intimidating
33:07
communities and committing crime with no
33:10
respect for authority or fear of the law
33:13
these are just some of the negative
33:15
stereotypes that exist about young
33:17
people today but how can we change this
33:20
misconception of young people this is
33:24
the head office of a charity called be
33:26
inspired everyone here works tirelessly
33:29
to counter the negative representations
33:32
of young people in the media today the
33:35
charity's PR manager Janko Mehta
33:37
explains the problem in the UK we've got
33:40
a massive image problem for young people
33:43
they are considered to be lazy
33:45
considered to be good-for-nothing youth
33:48
unemployment figures are very high in
33:50
the UK so it's very difficult for young
33:54
people to really kind of talk about the
33:56
good things that they have to offer I
33:58
think it's particularly bad problem at
34:00
the moment because youth unemployment in
34:02
the UK is so high young people are
34:04
struggling to get into universities
34:06
because tuition fees are really high and
34:08
there's a big divide between the
34:10
generations in the UK so what practical
34:13
help can be inspired offer young people
34:16
in the UK today at the moment it's quite
34:19
hard to be a young person it's quite
34:21
hard to feel good about what you have to
34:23
offer society when one in four young
34:25
people doesn't even have a job and but
34:27
volunteering can give young people a
34:29
sense of something good to offer their
34:32
society something positive that they can
34:35
do and just give them that boost that
34:37
they need to kind of go forward with
34:38
their careers and their lives we're in a
34:41
website called vinspired calm and
34:43
it's an online marketplace for young
34:46
people to link up with volunteering
34:47
opportunities in charities all over the
34:49
country at the moment we have 2,500
34:53
Charities registered on that website and
34:56
145 thousand young people use that
34:58
website to find opportunities and also
35:01
to log their volunteering hours so that
35:03
they have a great record of all the time
35:05
and effort they've put into their
35:06
volunteering work you only have to go to
35:08
the inspired website or the YouTube
35:11
channel to see some of the amazing work
35:13
that is being done by young volunteers
35:16
around the UK today from individual
35:19
carers to youth groups fighting to
35:21
improve their local communities the
35:23
stories and numerous and inspiring
35:26
everyone at the inspired knows that
35:29
there are thousands of young people in
35:31
the UK who do amazing work every day but
35:34
how do they get the message out we work
35:38
really hard to reach out to young people
35:40
in lots of different ways and that
35:41
includes using the press and media but
35:44
one of the biggest ways that we reach
35:46
young people is through social media
35:48
every year we run the vinspired national
35:51
awards which is the country's biggest
35:53
celebration of young volunteers we have
35:57
some young people who spend hours and
35:59
hours every single week doing wonderful
36:02
things with their communities but they
36:04
just don't get heard about so the VINs
36:06
bird national awards are about
36:07
celebrating those young people are
36:09
making sure that their efforts that get
36:10
recognized
36:11
[Music]
36:21
a past winner of the V inspired Awards
36:27
is Eliza Ribeiro from Croydon South
36:30
London
36:30
Eliza only recently turned 20 but she is
36:34
already an experienced volunteer and
36:36
campaigner Eliza won the V inspired
36:40
national bringing communities together
36:41
award for the work she does with her
36:44
organization lives not lives
36:46
Eliza hasn't always been an award winner
36:49
and positive role model quite the
36:52
opposite but it was her personal
36:54
experience of gang culture a knife crime
36:56
in her local area that led her to turn
36:59
her life around and to help others do
37:01
the same for Eliza the change started
37:05
with something very simple
37:07
so the t-shirts came about and they said
37:10
lives not knives on them and they were
37:11
just plain and loads of young people in
37:14
Croydon wanted them so I'm invested in
37:17
some t-shirts and with the money we
37:19
raised we held a party and got everyone
37:23
to sign a petition saying youth can have
37:26
fun without violence just to send to the
37:29
local press to prove that not all young
37:30
people were negative and sooner the
37:34
people were starting to take note of her
37:36
work in the community and lives not
37:39
knives was born our main objective was
37:42
to work in primary schools talking to
37:45
young people between of 9 to 11 about
37:50
the dangers of getting involved in knife
37:52
crime and gang culture and what can
37:55
happen if you do we started working in
37:58
about 6 to 10 primary schools and now
38:01
work in over 65 and so we now work with
38:06
over 10,000 young people a year of
38:08
course in Liza didn't do it all on her
38:10
own
38:11
many people have helped her my mum
38:14
helped set up lives not knives with me
38:16
and there's been the main kind of drive
38:18
for lives or knives and then since I was
38:23
16 and working with channel 4 they gave
38:25
us a lot of media coverage and helped us
38:27
train the Mentors
38:28
then we won a Princess Diana award and
38:32
then a Philip Lawrence award and of IANS
38:34
by a vote and that's given us huge media
38:37
coverage and as their national awards
38:39
it's been really helpful but the main
38:41
support has been the local community
38:43
that have volunteered their time in
38:45
helping us and then again my mum and my
38:47
grandma who give a lot of their time to
38:49
do work with Eliza - Eliza is brilliant
38:53
role model for young people growing up
38:54
in her area and beyond she is the
38:57
embodiment of what vinspired sets out to
39:00
achieve with young people around the
39:01
country and of course she has great
39:04
plans for the future live lives not
39:07
knives I want to create kind of mini
39:09
bases across the country so I think
39:12
there's a team of young people that are
39:13
committed to reducing crime across
39:15
London across England working together
39:17
will be a lot easier to understand the
39:19
problems of what's going wrong and also
39:22
being able to tackle it before it
39:24
actually does repeat itself for me
39:28
personally I kind of want to do a bit of
39:29
traveling and a bit of research on youth
39:32
crimes committed across the world and
39:34
other youth organizations that are
39:36
reducing crime but also to understand a
39:41
bit more for myself and kind of build a
39:43
project that might be able to work
39:45
across the board that reduces youth
39:47
crime and understands the mindset of
39:49
kind of young criminals and with the
39:52
support of her family community and
39:54
organizations like the inspired it's
39:57
easy to believe that anything is
39:59
possible for Eliza in the future

40:15
today brands are everywhere they're on
40:20
the clothes we wear
40:22
the cars we drive the equipment we work
40:25
with even on our food and drink but what
40:30
exactly is a brand a brand is the way a
40:34
business distinguishes its products from
40:36
the products of other businesses it
40:39
could be the company's name or its logo
40:45
or trademark as a concept branding has
40:49
dominated modern advertising in a world
40:55
where goods are mass-produced and
40:57
companies compete in a crowded
40:59
marketplace a unique brand is often a
41:02
corporations most valuable asset but how
41:05
important are brands to the people that
41:08
buy them what does a brand mean to them
41:11
have they ever paid more just because of
41:14
the brand of a products
41:18
no I tend to think I'm quite cheap
41:21
sometimes I might might buy a brand if
41:23
it's in a discounted like store or
41:26
online or again like in a charity shop
41:28
but I rarely pay full price as
41:31
something's expensive yes I have I'd say
41:35
I research into lighting I'm buying
41:37
because I want a bit more quality and I
41:40
want a bit more value for my money so I
41:42
usually research and then pay for the
41:43
brand if I feel it's worth it sure in
41:46
some cases it's justified if you were to
41:49
buy a car an automobile and you were to
41:51
buy something like a Porsche or Ferrari
41:53
you know what you're getting and you
41:57
know there's a lot of research and
41:58
development that goes into that whereas
42:00
a $300 pair of leather shoes or a belt
42:03
that I don't really feel like that's
42:05
worth it yeah for example my phone which
42:08
is an iPhone 4 I paid a lot more for
42:10
that because I know it's such a good
42:12
phone branding is not a modern
42:15
phenomenon as the extraordinary story of
42:18
Harris Tweed the distinctive fabric
42:21
produced on the tiny islands of the
42:23
Outer Hebrides proves
42:25
[Music]
42:30
the Outer Hebrides also known as the
42:33
Western Isles are a chain of tiny
42:35
islands situated off the northwestern
42:38
coast of Scotland and are home to a
42:40
population of around 26,000 people while
42:46
everyone speaks English the native
42:48
tongue of many of the Islanders is
42:49
gallic the largest of the inhabited
42:55
islands are the Isle of Lewis and the
43:00
Isle of Harris the historic home of
43:02
Harris Tweed
43:03
[Music]
43:07
Islanders have woven cloth by hand on
43:10
the islands for centuries but in the
43:14
1840s Lady Catherine Murray the countess
43:17
have done more whose family owned a lot
43:20
of land on the islands decided to sell
43:22
some tweed to her friends in London the
43:26
high-quality fabric was an instant
43:28
success and an industry was born
43:41
in 1909 the Harris Tweed Association was
43:45
founded and the famous orb trademark was
43:48
granted today Harris tweed is a global
43:53
business with the material being sold
43:55
all over the world
43:58
[Music]
44:00
but the cloth is still made using the
44:03
old machinery and the techniques of the
44:07
original Weaver's and uniquely it's a
44:12
process and brand that is protected by
44:15
its own Act of Parliament today the
44:32
Harris Tweed brand needs protecting
44:36
I'm Lauren McCauley I'm the chief
44:38
executive of the hardest read authority
44:40
he has in store nuit in Natal Hebrides
44:42
how distrito thority is a statutory
44:44
public authority created in 1993 by the
44:48
passing of the hardest read Act of
44:49
Parliament I'm tasked with holding in
44:53
trust for the people of the Atreides
44:55
the hardest to trademark or the Orbis is
44:58
a stamp on the cloth on every metre of
45:03
the cloth hardest read authority
45:05
inspectors are there at the final stage
45:08
of the production of the cloth and if
45:10
satisfied that that cloth meets the
45:13
terms of the hardest redact our stampers
45:16
our inspectors will apply a physical
45:19
mark to that cloth to reassure the
45:22
customers that they are buying genuine
45:24
halis tweed cloth in order to receive
45:27
the orb the material must be made from
45:29
pure wool and must be hand-woven by
45:33
Weaver's working in their own home on
45:35
the Outer Hebrides it proves to the
45:40
customer that the material is authentic
45:42
and meets the high standards of quality
45:44
associated with Harris Tweed hardest
45:49
weed to the consumer as a mark of
45:52
quality history heritage provenance
45:58
consumers tailors it is their colors and
46:01
patterns the depth of color and pattern
46:04
that that means so much them today as in
46:07
the past
46:08
it's the remarkable natural environment
46:10
of the islands that inspires the blue
46:12
of all colors and textures of the fabric
46:16
there are just three mills producing
46:19
cloth on the islands the mill employees
46:22
still carefully weigh out different
46:24
colored walls that when mixed together
46:26
and spun will create the distinctive
46:29
yarn that is supplied to the weavers in
46:31
their homes then it is with the
46:35
experienced skill and artistry of the
46:38
Weaver's working on looms powered by
46:40
just a foot pedal that the cloth is
46:43
created the cloth is then checked and
46:46
finished back in the mill before it
46:49
receives its orb stamp from the Harris
46:51
Tweed Authority that how does it orb has
46:54
traditionally always been inside as i
46:58
quiet discrete mark and this is the
47:02
first time in our treating history of
47:04
150 years where the orb is now being
47:07
used like other trademarks as a
47:09
decoration on the external of the cloth
47:11
today Harris Tweed is truly an
47:14
international brand they produce over a
47:17
million meters of cloth a year and while
47:20
originally the cloth was used for men's
47:22
jackets today it is used in an enormous
47:28
variety of products from computer tablet
47:31
covers and phone cases to shoes and even
47:35
dog leads all of these products carrying
47:39
the Harris Tweed branding Harris Tweed
47:43
is an unlikely success story it's an
47:46
industry located on isolated islands
47:49
that still uses techniques and machinery
47:52
that have been out of date for over a
47:54
century but this is also the brand's
47:57
greatest advantage
48:00
in a world of mass-produced fabric
48:03
Harris tweed still stands for
48:05
authenticity and craftsmanship and is a
48:09
guarantee of the highest quality a most
48:12
beautiful cloth
48:13
[Music]
48:30
where might you first meet the love of
48:33
your life
48:34
[Music]
48:36
at school at work on holiday or just
48:46
while you're waiting for a train one day
48:48
[Music]
48:52
ask any couple and they will be able to
48:55
tell you the story of how they met and
48:57
decided to spend the rest of their lives
48:59
together often the stories are simple
49:03
but sometimes they are extraordinary
49:07
okay so we met in Sharm el-sheikh in
49:10
Egypt in what was it November October
49:15
last year we we are we are both from the
49:19
same place yeah Birmingham in England
49:21
but we never knew each other before and
49:23
we've been back since to Sharm el-sheikh
49:28
my son started playing with your son on
49:31
holiday and it's not to defend it from
49:34
there really
49:34
we met at a wedding in France a mutual
49:38
friend's wedding in can to be precise
49:40
mm-hmm it was a lovely wedding yet she
49:42
was a bridesmaid and I was one of the
49:44
guests and we hit it off mm-hmm so how
49:47
did you end up together we well we hit
49:51
it off at the wedding we were put at the
49:53
same table
49:54
the same day we put at the same table
49:55
we've got gone over very well it was a
49:57
three-day wedding so we got to know each
49:58
other very well over those three days
50:00
she's from Boston in the States so she
50:03
went back there I went back to London
50:04
where I'm from here and we sort of had
50:07
an online relationship we tape Skype
50:11
yeah for a couple of months and then she
50:13
came to London to do her MBA and we
50:16
spent about a year together in London
50:18
and now here and a half year an hour for
50:20
now we're in Boston living together
50:21
mm-hmm
50:22
we met in a bar in London and and I was
50:24
on a night out after work on a Friday
50:26
night with my front with a friend of
50:27
mine and yeah we we got talking right
50:32
yeah I was actually at the time I was
50:34
doing an internship in Italy but I went
50:36
to a city break in London for about ten
50:38
days so I went with a couple of my
50:39
girlfriends and we were just hanging out
50:41
and you know he we saw each other I
50:43
think pretty early on but then he
50:45
eventually have maybe like an hour later
50:46
so came up to talking things kind of
50:48
went from there but in an increasingly
50:52
busy world you sometimes struggle to
50:54
meet new people
50:56
and occasionally it takes something a
50:58
little out of the ordinary to bring two
51:01
people together this is Olivia and James
51:06
they've recently got engaged and they're
51:09
planning their wedding which will take
51:10
place in Scotland next year Olivia and
51:13
James's love story had quite an
51:15
unconventional beginning I put myself
51:18
forward for a blind date in a magazine
51:21
in a national newspaper and nine months
51:26
later I got an email saying we found
51:29
somebody would you like to go out for
51:31
dinner and meet this mystery person so
51:34
that's how I met James was turning up to
51:36
a restaurant and seeing him for the
51:39
first time I also wrote into the
51:44
magazine and two days later they contact
51:48
me and said actually I know he said we
51:50
wouldn't find anyone but we have found
51:52
someone would you be interested in going
51:54
on a blind date
51:55
which obviously he said yes and about a
51:59
month later we met at the restaurant I
52:03
was told that I thought Olivia's name
52:05
and I was told what she did how old she
52:13
was
52:13
and a few a few interests but and that
52:18
was it
52:19
yeah it was the same and they told me
52:21
that James was interested in
52:23
architecture writing and theatre I think
52:27
Oh sailing sailing yeah three things
52:29
yeah I remember you were interested in
52:32
the arts I think and also architecture I
52:35
think that's where they connected us
52:38
[Music]
52:48
the very first time James and Olivia met
52:52
was at a restaurant booked by the
52:53
Guardian newspaper today what do they
52:57
remember about that dinner well that
53:00
evening was very memorable we talked
53:02
about all kinds of different things we
53:05
talked about sailing and and how we'd
53:09
done the same run a few weeks earlier
53:12
before we met there were lots of things
53:14
but the most remarkable thing was just
53:17
how long we talked non-stop for about
53:20
four hours until the restaurant closed
53:23
even before they had written the
53:25
feedback for the newspaper article
53:27
Olivia and James knew that they wanted
53:30
to see each other again after the date I
53:34
got a text from James the next day which
53:36
is perfect timing and it was a really
53:39
lovely text saying what a lovely evening
53:41
he'd had and and it was very nice to me
53:44
so I immediately replied and said
53:48
brilliant let's meet up next week and so
53:51
he arranged a time to meet her and did
53:53
they discuss what they were writing
53:55
about each other for the newspaper
53:57
article no we didn't know what each
54:00
other had written about the other one so
54:02
that was quite exciting and by that
54:05
point we had gone out for dinner a
54:08
couple of times and so we we knew each
54:10
other but we have made a point of not
54:13
telling the other one what we'd written
54:15
so Olivia and James became a couple and
54:18
two years on what is it that makes their
54:21
relationship work oh that's a good
54:25
question I think what I think what makes
54:28
our relationship work is well we've both
54:32
got a good sense of humor and I think
54:34
James is hilarious so I'm laughing a lot
54:37
all the time that is very important
54:39
humor I think yeah not just general
54:42
laughing but being able to defuse
54:44
moments with humor is very important and
54:47
if you don't share a sense of humor you
54:49
it's hard to do that but I think also
54:51
our interests are ever so slightly
54:54
different so things that Jane
54:57
says you know his interest i used to
55:00
claim when my interest and then realized
55:02
I never find the time for them things
55:04
like going to the theater and so when I
55:06
met James those are the things that we
55:08
did together and it was brilliant
55:09
because I was suddenly finding the time
55:12
to do the things I claimed I like doing
55:14
but never quite managed to squeeze in
55:16
and the relationship works so well that
55:19
they've decided to spend the rest of
55:21
their lives together we had known each
55:24
other for just over two years when I
55:26
proposed yeah
55:29
about two years and two months I think I
55:32
had planned to propose Christmastime
55:36
because I knew Olivia would be with her
55:39
family then and that's I thought that
55:42
would be a good time and also her family
55:46
live in Scotland in a very pretty part
55:48
of Scotland and I thought it was quite
55:49
neither see I thought I could propose on
55:51
the beach well that sounded like a good
55:53
plan but then I decided no it's now I'm
56:00
going to propose now or at least the
56:01
coming weekend we were going to the
56:04
theatre to see a play and it's a it's
56:07
the National Theatre and which is a
56:10
quite a cool building and I thought we
56:13
could I could propose somewhere in the
56:16
bill play in the theatre so we then
56:19
arrived at the theatre Olivia said I'm
56:21
really looking forward to lunch and very
56:23
hungry I said I had been promised lunch
56:26
before the play and then there was this
56:28
change of plan I got really grumpy I
56:31
said uh why don't we just go on a tour
56:33
cuz we don't have time it'll be
56:36
brilliant great like the I they're
56:39
really good it'll be really short you
56:41
said no it won't come on it'll be
56:46
brilliant and so Olivia stood there with
56:47
her arms crossed whilst I waited for the
56:49
lady to arrive to take us yeah she took
56:51
us straight to the biggest stage at the
56:54
National there are three stages and the
56:56
biggest is the Olivier stage we needed
57:00
something to prompt us and so she said
57:02
well you have the audience of the
57:04
Olivier here is there anything you'd
57:06
like to say to the audience they live
57:07
here laughed and I said well actually
57:09
you
57:10
come and sit with me on the chair on the
57:14
two chairs and hmm what you're gonna do
57:16
now and I said them
57:19
I've actually been planning this all
57:21
week and she said planning what and at
57:25
that point I sort of slid off my chair
57:27
and onto my knee and I'll sir to marry
57:30
me
57:30
she should have gasped and said yes grab
57:35
me a big hug and the news of their
57:39
engagement didn't just thrilled family
57:41
and friends know the girl who set us up
57:44
she was lovely and she was lovely you
57:48
know as things worked out we stayed in
57:51
touch with her and you know we told her
57:53
quite quickly when we got engaged
57:54
because she'd been doing that job for
57:57
quite a number of years and we were the
57:59
first couple she'd set on to get married
58:01
so apparently when I sent the email or
58:04
text or whatever it was she stood up in
58:07
the middle of their open play hands
58:09
above her head and said weep we've got a
58:11
blind date wedding yeah it meant a lot
58:16
to her I think yeah
58:21
[Music]
58:31
we live on an amazing planet Earth is
58:36
about 4.5 billion years old and despite
58:40
appearances it's not a perfect sphere
58:43
[Music]
58:44
gravity's pressure which causes water to
58:47
bulge around its middle gives earth a
58:50
circumference of just over 40,000
58:53
kilometers our planet has seven
58:59
continents and over 70% of its surface
59:02
is covered by the water which is
59:04
contained in five oceans a hundred and
59:07
forty seas thousands of rivers and lakes
59:10
and vast areas of ice humans have
59:15
explored less than 10% of the world's
59:18
oceans mountains scar the earth the
59:24
Andes is the largest and longest
59:27
mountain range above water much higher
59:30
and longer mountains lie under the
59:32
oceans unexplored humans live in just 1%
59:38
of the Earth's available land an
59:41
astonishing 40 percent of the land is
59:44
still a wilderness of natural
59:46
environments and forests which humans
59:48
haven't cultivated
59:51
[Music]
59:55
and many of us know surprisingly little
59:57
about this remarkable world which we
60:00
live in and we struggle with the
60:03
simplest of Geographic questions how
60:08
about you how good is your geography
60:12
[Music]
60:15
pretty good my dad as a geography
60:17
teacher I'll say average at best it's
60:23
probably not as good as it should be for
60:25
my age but I'm slowly learning the
60:28
capitals of Europe so can you answer
60:31
three simple questions starting with an
60:34
easy one what's the longest river in the
60:37
world
60:42
Mississippi Zambezi of the Nile
60:46
or the Amazon maybe is it one of those
60:50
Mississippi the Nile the Nile
60:55
maybe the Amazon but otherwise it might
60:59
be some in the states I'm not sure the
61:01
Nile although this is a contested title
61:06
most people agree that the Nile and not
61:09
its nearest competitor the Amazon is the
61:12
longest river in the world the river
61:15
which passes through 11 African
61:18
countries is approximately six thousand
61:20
six hundred and fifty kilometers long
61:22
and it is essential to the lives of tens
61:26
of millions of people who live near it
61:31
next question what's the highest
61:34
waterfall in the world
61:37
Niagara Falls Angel Falls Victoria Falls
61:45
the Angel Falls in South America I think
61:50
maybe Angel Falls that's in the back of
61:53
my mind somewhere might be right the
61:55
highest waterfall in the world is Angel
61:58
Falls in Venezuela these isolated falls
62:02
drop 979 meters over the edge of the
62:06
Alliant supreme mountains in the canaima
62:09
national park these Falls may have less
62:13
water flow than the more famous iguazu
62:16
niagara or victoria falls but have the
62:19
highest uninterrupted drop final
62:25
question what's the biggest desert in
62:27
the world the Sahara Desert let's say
62:32
the Sahara so I want to say Sahara but I
62:35
know there's a trick question there
62:37
because I know it's not and it's
62:39
somewhere else maybe like in Australia
62:41
or something I don't know I'm gonna have
62:44
sex to her even though I know it's wrong
62:49
well it could be one of the poles
62:52
because the desert doesn't have to be
62:53
hot does it does it can be cold so it
62:56
could be the South Pole perhaps first
63:00
thing that comes to mind is probably the
63:01
Sahara it's a trick question of course
63:05
antarctica is the biggest desert because
63:08
it experiences so little rain the
63:11
technical definition of a desert at 14
63:15
million square kilometres antarctica is
63:18
nearly 1.5 times the size of the sahara
63:21
desert which is still the biggest hot
63:24
desert on earth
63:29
[Music]
63:39
earth is a planet of extreme ecosystems
63:43
from abundant and diverse to barren and
63:46
inhospitable but they are all equally
63:49
important to the balance of the planet
63:51
the single largest living organism on
63:54
the planet can actually be seen from
63:56
space located in the Coral Sea off the
64:00
coast of Queensland in Northeast
64:02
Australia the Great Barrier Reef is one
64:06
of UNESCO seven natural wonders of the
64:08
world the reef is composed of almost
64:12
3000 individual reefs and 900 islands
64:15
and stretches for over 2,600 kilometers
64:20
around 1,500 different types of fish
64:24
live in the Great Barrier Reef about 10%
64:28
of the world's total fish species it's
64:31
also home to over 400 types of coral all
64:35
this natural beauty makes it an
64:38
extremely popular place for tourists and
64:40
over a million people visit the reef
64:43
every year many snorkel or dive to truly
64:47
appreciate the stunning world beneath
64:49
the waves
64:52
the high number of people who visit the
64:54
reef every year poses a risk to its
64:57
delicate ecosystem but the biggest
65:02
threat to the reef comes from climate
65:04
change more than half of the coral on
65:08
the reef has been lost since 1985 and
65:12
this is having a disastrous effect on
65:14
this most spectacular of natural wonders
65:23
at the other extreme is the Atacama
65:27
Desert located in northern Chile
65:31
the Atacama is the driest desert in the
65:33
world most of the time there isn't any
65:36
rain here in fact there are parts of the
65:40
Atacama Desert
65:41
which have never had any rain the
65:44
weather is so arid here that even the
65:46
mountains that rise to over 6500 meters
65:50
have no places the desert covers over a
65:54
hundred thousand square kilometres and
65:57
it is mostly comprised of salt basins
66:00
and sand but despite the lack of
66:03
rainfall there are still a few lagoons
66:06
in the Atacama

there's even a river the San Pedro which
66:13
flows through the desert there's also a
66:19
remarkable Giza field at el tatio and
66:27
the area is rich in minerals it contains
66:31
the world's largest supply of sodium
66:34
nitrate and there are many mines
66:36
extracting copper from under the desert
66:39
it was in a copper mine in the Atacama
66:42
Desert that 33 miners became trapped in
66:45
2010 the miners who were eventually
66:51
rescued after spending 52 days
66:54
underground made news headlines around
66:57
the world but the soil here is sterile
67:04
making it almost impossible to cultivate
67:06
for farming soil samples that have been
67:12
taken from the atacama show many
67:14
similarities with soil collected from
67:16
the planet Mars the area is so barren
67:20
that it is used by scientists to test
67:23
instruments for future missions to Mars
67:25
and it is home to Alma the largest and
67:30
most expensive telescope projects in the
67:33
world so it is from this extraordinary
67:40
desert environment that we learn not
67:43
only more about our own planet but about
67:45
our solar system too

it's a beautiful spring morning in the
68:08
quiet countryside of County Durham in
68:10
the northeast of England on a hill
68:14
overlooking the gorgeous countryside sit
68:17
sparkly old hall
68:20
[Music]
68:21
the new hall was built in the late 1700s
68:25
and it's now a bustling hub of a home in
68:30
the kitchen the maid is making bread for
68:34
the family she doesn't need to follow a
68:36
recipe it's a job she has done every day
68:39
since she came to work at the house as a
68:41
teenager down at home farm the farmer is
68:46
preparing a field for the crop of Swedes
68:48
that will be planted soon it's now a
68:53
Victorian times but farming is still
68:56
back-breaking work in a time before
69:01
tractors the farmer relies on his
69:04
workhorses and his own skill and
69:07
experience to get the job done of course
69:12
none of this is real but this is how
69:15
life used to be in the northeast of
69:17
England in the past
69:19
this is Beamish the living museum of the
69:22
north visitors come here to see how
69:25
people used to live eat travel and work
69:28
in the period from the 1820s to the
69:31
early 1900s situated close to the city
69:35
of Newcastle Beamish is one of the most
69:38
popular museums in the UK with close to
69:41
half a million visitors every year and
69:45
the museum's success is not exceptional
69:47
in modern times there seems to be
69:50
something of a resurgence in interest in
69:52
how we used to live living history
69:55
museums and carefully preserved
69:57
ancestral homes are increasingly popular
69:59
destinations for people to visit so why
70:03
do we see more interested in seeing how
70:05
people used to live than how they live
70:08
now why are we so interested in the past
70:12
it is our heritage it's where we come
70:15
from I live in a really old city I live
70:17
in Edinburgh in Scotland and it the
70:19
histories everywhere you can't you walk
70:21
down every street and it's full of old
70:23
buildings and you imagine who might have
70:26
lived there you know a hundred years ago
70:28
who stood where you were standing now I
70:30
think some people probably might not
70:33
have been interested in finding out
70:35
about their past and their heritage but
70:37
then they might be drawn to it because
70:38
they fall in love with with a book or a
70:40
movie or a TV show that they're really
70:41
interested in and that sort of triggers
70:43
some interest nearly everyone agrees
70:47
that we have a lot to learn from the
70:49
past but do they agree that in the
70:54
modern age it is still important to keep
70:56
the old skills alive definitely I
71:00
believe so I think we need a little bit
71:02
of the path to mingle a little bit with
71:05
our present too much I think if we got
71:09
rid of it then we would just lose who we
71:11
are I think old skills in terms of
71:14
cooking and baking will always be
71:15
important in day-to-day life but plowing
71:18
with horses and some you know knitting
71:20
may not be as important I think it's a
71:23
great skill to have
71:24
but given you know modernization of
71:28
Technology and and mass production of
71:31
things I think many of those skills are
71:33
probably going to go by the wayside into
71:35
the future
71:38
[Music]
71:49
at the Beamish museum the staff worked
71:52
to provide their visitors with the most
71:54
authentic historical experience possible
71:58
the museum opened in 1972 but work
72:02
started on the collection long before
72:04
that in the late 1950s the old customs
72:08
and traditions of the Northeast were
72:10
starting to die out as industry in the
72:13
region declined the communities that
72:17
used to serve the Colliers shipyards and
72:19
farms were disappearing and with them
72:22
the old way of life was being lost a
72:26
project started to collect things from
72:29
the past anything and everything that
72:32
used to be part of everyday life the
72:34
people of the region gave generously
72:38
thousands and thousands of objects from
72:41
kitchenware to steam engines and these
72:44
all became part of the recreation of the
72:47
vanished communities at Beamish today at
72:52
the center of the 300 acre site is the
72:55
recreation of a town from the turn of
72:57
the century the town is complete with
73:00
homes shops where you can buy handmade
73:03
sweets and even a local dentist
73:10
[Music]
73:13
visitors travel around the site on
73:16
beautifully restored trams
73:20
they can visit pakka old hall to see how
73:23
life was lived by the local landowner
73:25
his family and staff and they can visit
73:30
a Collier village from 1913 and see the
73:35
cramped workers terraces where women
73:37
used to bake bread in communal ovens
73:39
behind their houses they can also see
73:43
the local school where the boys and
73:45
girls were educated separately and the
73:48
tiny pit ponies who used to work down
73:50
the mines visitors can even get an
73:54
authentic taste of the past from this
73:57
takeaway where their cooking is still
73:59
turn with coal fires just like it used
74:01
to be and the fish and chips are just as
74:07
popular and delicious as they have
74:09
always been and more than just a museum
74:14
Beamish has become an invaluable
74:16
educational resource as well as offering
74:21
its visitors a glimpse into how life
74:23
used to be lived it helps to preserve
74:26
and pass on old skills through a range
74:29
of short courses the old ways are all
74:33
brought to life by the costumed
74:35
demonstrators who work at the Museum
74:39
it's their job to interact with the
74:42
visitors to provide insight and
74:44
explanations of the world around them
74:47
visitors ranged from primary school
74:49
children to the elderly and their
74:51
reactions to the experience can be very
74:53
different
74:55
Sonia winix as a maid at pakka old hall
74:58
so what do the older visitors find
75:01
interesting when they come to see her in
75:03
the kitchen
75:05
really they're interested in the things
75:08
that they can remember from their
75:10
childhood or from their grandmother's
75:12
house
75:12
so it's oh I used to have one of those
75:15
or I couldn't remember when we used to
75:17
use this you know a lot of things
75:20
although were set in the 1820s a lot of
75:22
things carried on until early early last
75:26
century so things you know if things
75:29
weren't broke you didn't replace them so
75:32
things went from January
75:33
- generation to generation and how is
75:37
this different from her younger visitors
75:39
the children when they come they're
75:41
absolutely amazed by the fire a lot of
75:44
them have never seen a real fire before
75:46
some of them are actually quite reticent
75:48
they don't really want to go too near it
75:50
because obviously they've been told stay
75:52
away from fire Sonia learned her baking
75:55
skills the traditional way and after
75:58
working at Beamish for many years she's
76:00
used to her life as an eighteen twenties
76:03
maid and there are few things in the
76:05
modern world that she couldn't live
76:07
without
76:08
well the skills that I'm using today are
76:11
skills that have been passed on from
76:13
mother to daughter through generations
76:15
so I'm just doing what my mother used to
76:17
do and what my grandmother used to do I
76:20
think I could pretty much live without
76:23
everything that we take for granted
76:24
today but the one thing I think I
76:27
couldn't really live without is
76:28
international travel the ability to move
76:31
from one country to another with such
76:33
ease I think it's very underrated the
76:37
author LP Hartley once wrote that the
76:40
past is a foreign country they do things
76:42
differently there at the Beamish Museum
76:46
they make visiting this foreign country
76:49
as enjoyable as possible but they also
76:52
help to keep it easily accessible to
76:54
every generation

77:11
this is the beautiful city of Copenhagen
77:14
in Denmark the city situated on the
77:18
eastern coast of the island of Zealand
77:20
is Denmark's biggest city and has been
77:24
its capital since the beginning of the
77:25
15th century today the city is home to
77:29
over a million people and it's a
77:32
bustling and cosmopolitan city with
77:35
stunning palaces and parks
77:39
great shops and world-class restaurants
77:44
but Copenhagen's origin is as a small
77:47
fishing village established back in the
77:50
10th century by the most famous and
77:52
feared of Denmark's old inhabitants the
77:56
Vikings the legacy of a great Viking
77:59
Empire that dates back more than a
78:02
thousand years can be seen across Europe
78:04
to this day but now it's very hard to
78:08
separate fact from fiction when talking
78:11
about the Vikings so many myths sagas
78:15
and legends have grown up around the
78:18
medieval civilization of Raiders traders
78:21
and intrepid explorers that it's
78:24
difficult to know which of the stories
78:26
are actually true
78:29
over a thousand years after the end of
78:32
the Viking era new technology working in
78:35
tandem with old skills is helping us to
78:38
learn more about this great civilization
78:40
and some of the most important work is
78:44
happening not far from Copenhagen in the
78:46
historic town of Roskilde the town of
78:50
Roskilde is around 30 kilometres west of
78:53
Copenhagen sitting at the head of the
78:55
Roskilde fjord in Viking times the town
78:59
was the capital of Denmark and a vital
79:02
trading centre there had always been
79:05
rumors that Viking ships might have been
79:07
deliberately sunk in the Roskilde fjord
79:10
in order to protect the capital from
79:12
attack from the sea for years fishermen
79:17
and divers had been finding parts that
79:19
could have come from Viking ships in
79:21
shallow water at school de Lev 20
79:24
kilometers from Roskilde but it wasn't
79:27
until 1962 that work began to excavate
79:31
this area of the fjord and five ships
79:34
emerged from the mud the ships had
79:37
probably been at the bottom of the fjord
79:39
since the 11th century they were in
79:43
thousands of pieces and this left the
79:46
archaeologists with a massive intricate
79:49
jigsaw puzzle that would take them many
79:51
years to solve
79:54
every piece of timber needed to be
79:56
carefully recorded and preserved so that
79:59
the ships could be rebuilt in the museum
80:02
that had been specially constructed at
80:04
Roskilde today visitors can see the
80:10
result of this painstaking work in the
80:13
museum hall that is now home to the
80:15
ship's known as schooled alev 1 2 3 5 &
80:24
6 the ships range in size and purpose
80:30
school talev 1 was a cargo ship built in
80:33
norway and used on trading expeditions
80:37
school de left 6 was a much smaller
80:40
vessel probably used for fishing and
80:43
[Music]
80:46
school the left 2 was perhaps the most
80:49
impressive of all a 30 meter ocean-going
80:52
long ship which would have been manned
80:54
by a crew of 65 to 70 warriors all these
81:00
skeletal reconstructions were just the
81:02
first step in a process that was to
81:04
reveal an enormous amount about the
81:06
Vikings
81:08
[Music]
81:22
the Viking ship Museum at Roskilde is
81:25
more than just a museum it's also home
81:28
to a research institution and a working
81:31
boat yard where they use experimental
81:34
archaeology to uncover the secrets of
81:36
the Viking ship builders prowess the
81:43
team of archaeologists and shipbuilders
81:46
at Roskilde take all the information
81:48
from the remains found at the bottom of
81:50
the fjord and use it to create exact 1
81:55
to 10 scale models of the ships
81:58
[Music]
82:01
these models then provide the template
82:04
for full-scale reconstructions that are
82:07
built in the shipyard importantly the
82:11
entire process of building the replica
82:14
ships is done using reproductions of
82:16
tools that would have been used by the
82:19
Vikings careful analysis of the marks on
82:24
the timber and the accumulated knowledge
82:26
from previous finds of Viking Age tools
82:29
from places as far away as Canada helped
82:33
the shipbuilders to understand which
82:36
tools must have been used
82:38
finally the completed replica ships are
82:41
sailed and tested at sea in all weather
82:44
conditions and it is through this
82:47
process of testing the ships in the
82:49
water that some of the most valuable
82:51
information is obtained we get a lot of
82:54
answers on questions we ask when we
82:58
build it things we cannot we cannot find
83:02
out why why did they do it like this and
83:04
and still we do it exactly why they did
83:07
it and even though we can't find the
83:09
answer but we will find it when we go
83:11
out sailing with a boat because it's
83:13
where it should be it's where it's built
83:15
for and if it's not functioning under
83:18
sea under big waves and when you get
83:20
seasick and all this then it's bit maybe
83:25
because we have reconstructed this year
83:27
this ship in the wrong way sir Nielson
83:30
is head of the boat yard at Roskilde he
83:34
was in charge of the sea stallion
83:35
construction project the sea stallion
83:40
from Glen Tulloch
83:41
is the replica ship built from the
83:43
skeleton of the skull de left to long
83:46
boat analysis of its timber had revealed
83:50
that the ship must have been built in
83:52
Ireland probably in the vicinity of
83:54
Dublin around the Year 1042
83:58
reconstructing the ship took over three
84:01
years but when it was completed CERN was
84:05
on the crew when they sailed the ship
84:07
from Roskilde back to its original home
84:10
Dublin it was an exhilarating and
84:13
illuminating
84:14
tread so sailing the ships it makes you
84:17
think about the Viking Age it makes you
84:21
think about the organization of sixty
84:23
people on board a ship like this how to
84:26
organize these people and how to sail it
84:29
how to handle this year without breaking
84:33
it so it gives you a lot of answers on
84:37
questions but of course then it gives
84:39
you a lot of new questions on a lot of
84:42
things how did they sail around north
84:44
Scotland in the Viking Age with sixty
84:47
hungry people warriors and how did they
84:51
go to Isle of Man for example with sixty
84:54
ships not only one ship we have
84:56
difficult today where we have our cell
84:58
phones and everything we have a lot of
85:00
difficulties to to actually organize
85:03
this this trip but think about the
85:06
Viking Age where they came hundreds
85:08
ships how did they organize that going
85:11
into the coast at exactly the same time
85:13
be ready to fight
85:15
have water enough to be to be shipshape
85:18
it's some of these questions you just
85:22
have to ask yourself when you're sailing
85:23
there while the structure of the ship
85:25
was authentic the sea stallion had added
85:28
modern GPS to ensure the safety of the
85:31
65 strong modern day crew the journey
85:35
took more than six weeks and when they
85:38
finally arrived in Dublin emotions were
85:40
running high I would say we were crying
85:45
mostly because when we went in there was
85:49
I don't know ten thousand people a lot
85:52
of people and and Dublin they think this
85:54
now we're coming back with the ship it
85:56
belongs to them and the system it was
85:59
just in every Dublin his heart I think
86:01
they were there and when we went into
86:04
the big harbour the big ships I started
86:06
with you know and people ago it was a
86:10
big moment it was not because
86:14
we haven't like crossed the North in the
86:17
North Atlantic or something like that
86:18
but it was just we felt very very good
86:21
welcome that we went together in the
86:24
past few years another nine ships have
86:27
been unearthed at Roskilde and work is
86:29
ongoing to preserve and reconstruct
86:32
these ships and through this work we
86:35
will find out even more about the
86:37
fascinating Viking civilization and the
86:40
incredibly skillful ship builders that
86:42
made it all possible
86:44
[Music]
86:59
most people know there are five main
87:02
senses sight hearing taste smell and
87:09
touch all of these senses influence how
87:14
we experience the world but what's the
87:17
most important sense I'll definitely say
87:19
probably sight I think without that I
87:22
don't think you'd be able to get an
87:23
impression of what's going on around you
87:26
obviously the other ones work just as
87:28
well but it's just seeing like
87:30
everything in color and in three that
87:33
you can really kind of like give an
87:35
impression of what things are without
87:37
using the other senses I think that
87:39
smell is the most important sense
87:42
opposed to all the others because it
87:44
brings out the memories and people more
87:46
than I feel other senses would so if you
87:49
were to smell of food that you were to
87:51
smell when you were a kid it would bring
87:53
out an immediate sense of satisfaction
87:55
or happiness that some others could of
88:00
course all senses are important but what
88:03
would it be like if he could hear color
88:05
for some people this isn't a
88:08
hypothetical situation people with
88:11
synesthesia experience this crossover of
88:14
the senses all the time synesthesia is a
88:18
relatively common but harmless
88:20
neurological condition where people make
88:22
connections between their senses some
88:26
synesthetes the name given to people
88:28
with synesthesia associate letters on
88:31
numbers with a specific color
88:34
so the letter A might be read father
88:38
number one might be blue others
88:42
associate colors or shapes with sounds
88:45
and some even make connections with
88:49
their sense of taste scientists have
88:53
been aware of the existence of
88:55
synesthesia for over 200 years but for a
88:59
long time they knew very little about
89:02
the condition but today they can use
89:05
neuroimaging to see how our senses
89:07
stimulate our brain the sensory cortex
89:12
is the part of the brain that deals with
89:14
the senses different areas of the
89:18
sensory cortex are stimulated by
89:20
different senses
89:22
scientists believe that synesthesia is
89:25
caused by an unusual amount of
89:27
connections between these areas in the
89:31
past synesthesia was thought to be
89:33
extremely rare but today scientists
89:37
believe between 1 and 4 percent of the
89:39
population half the condition in fact
89:43
even people that don't have synesthesia
89:45
often make connections between their
89:48
senses these strange connections between
89:52
senses all come under the term
89:54
multi-sensory perception and this is
89:56
currently an intriguing area of
89:59
scientific research

the cross-modal research laboratory at
90:20
oxford university his studies have multi
90:24
sensory perception affects the way we
90:26
interact with the world and how this can
90:28
be exploited by experimental
90:31
psychologists working here at Oxford
90:33
University and I'm interested in the
90:35
senses in hearing and vision and touch
90:37
taste pain and how those senses get to
90:41
put together in people's heads and in
90:44
this building with a lot of neuroscience
90:45
going on which means you try and
90:47
understand the rules that connect your
90:49
eye to your ear your ear to your nose
90:51
your nose to your math professor spends
90:55
calls this multi sensory stimulation or
90:57
multi sensory perception so multi
91:01
sensory stimulation multi sensory
91:04
perception refers to the idea that we
91:07
have five senses or perhaps more hearing
91:09
vision touch taste and smell and most of
91:13
the time when we experience the world or
91:15
products around us they stimulate most
91:20
not all of the senses so I think most
91:23
people when they're studying how the
91:25
senses interact tend to focus on hearing
91:28
and vision so why it is you hear the
91:30
voice coming from the lips on the screen
91:31
in the cinema that we call the
91:33
ventriloquist's dummy illusion and
91:37
separately there are people working in
91:38
food science thinking about how smells
91:41
and tastes and the pain of a chili burn
91:44
come together to give rise to flavors in
91:47
the mouth those two things rarely come
91:49
together and that's a lot of the work
91:50
that we do and so that's a link between
91:55
say tastes and flavors and sound is the
91:57
last one anyone thinks about
92:00
he believes we use multi sensory
92:03
perception all the time when we're
92:05
eating a meal or choosing a particular
92:07
product in the supermarket it's an
92:10
important part of our everyday lives so
92:13
take a lovely meal then it's going to
92:15
taste right you just have the right
92:16
aroma or smell it needs to look visually
92:19
appealing the crunch the sound should be
92:22
right should the texture the mouthfeel
92:25
or the fattiness in the mouth so all the
92:27
senses are involved in the perception of
92:28
food and that may be the most
92:31
multi-sensory of our experiences but
92:33
elsewhere if I think about some sort of
92:36
packaging or something and say this
92:37
bottle here it's got a certain weight so
92:39
that's got a tactile perception it's got
92:42
a feel of roughness so that's kind of
92:44
sort of got a sound I can hear what
92:47
color and it'll have a smell so all the
92:50
senses are again being involved in my
92:52
perception of this product tenets
92:53
packaging and learned a lot of the work
92:55
that we do with companies now is trying
92:56
to help them enhance the multi-sensory
92:58
appeal of what they're offering
93:01
Professor Spence's team are working hard
93:04
to improve our understanding of multi
93:06
sensory perception a lot of this
93:09
research is very useful for food
93:11
businesses today they are testing how
93:17
different music can affect the taste of
93:19
coffee we're looking at sort of
93:23
synesthesia which is very this mixing of
93:27
the senses people who see colored
93:29
numbers or days of the week are the ones
93:31
you see on television but we think that
93:34
maybe we're all synesthetes kind of so
93:37
that when we give people in the lab
93:39
downstairs
93:40
different tastes flavors aromas and we
93:43
give them a choice of any instrument any
93:46
pitch of sound just pick an instrument
93:47
and a hi-low tour an own that low note
93:50
that goes with that taste say it's a
93:53
taste of coffee or the smell of
93:55
chocolate or of raspberries it sounds
93:58
like a bizarre thing to do and it would
94:00
be New Year's and most of our subjects
94:02
give reliable answers that are very
94:05
similar to one another so most people
94:07
will say that sweet is is high-pitched
94:09
and probably a piano whereas bitter
94:13
tastes I kind of loped
94:14
and they're more brassy in nature and
94:17
when you find subject after subject who
94:19
says the same thing then you can use
94:21
those insights to try and create
94:22
soundtracks that Sena statically matched
94:25
the tastes of food we perceive the world
94:28
through our senses everything we
94:31
experience we experience through our
94:33
sense of touch taste smell sight or
94:37
hearing therefore a better understanding
94:40
of how the senses work and how they work
94:43
together will lead to a better
94:44
understanding of the world we live in
94:51

95:02
have you ever borrowed a Zipcar
95:06
use the bike sharing scheme or rented a
95:10
room from Airbnb if you have the newer
95:14
parts of the sharing economy in this
95:18
sharing economy people don't need to own
95:21
the products they use technology allows
95:25
consumers to share access to things
95:27
instead these new consumer habits have
95:31
been termed collaborative consumption
95:35
collaborative consumption is one of the
95:38
big new economic ideas of the
95:40
Information Age the sharing economy is
95:44
now estimated to be worth over 300
95:47
billion pounds and companies that offer
95:50
products which can be shared are some of
95:53
the fastest growing businesses in the
95:55
world
95:57
Zipcar is an international car sharing
96:01
company it gives customers access to a
96:04
wide range of vehicles which they can
96:07
hire by the hour or by the day
96:12
customers can book online or via a
96:14
smartphone app unlike traditional rental
96:21
companies Zipcar offers access to the
96:23
vehicle immediately Airbnb is a website
96:30
that allows people with accommodation to
96:32
host people looking for a place to stay
96:35
the company was established in 2008 by
96:39
2012 the company had over 250,000
96:43
listings in more than 30,000 cities in
96:46
the world even governments participate
96:52
in the sharing economy all over the
96:55
world cities are starting bike sharing
96:57
schemes these schemes provide cheap and
97:01
easy access to bikes for short city
97:03
journeys there are now around five
97:06
hundred and thirty five bike sharing
97:08
programs across the globe the success of
97:14
these businesses and initiatives
97:16
highlights a wider change in social
97:19
attitudes most people have engaged in
97:22
collaborative consumption in one way or
97:24
another as the sharing economy grows
97:28
people aren't just sharing via the
97:30
virtual world they are coming together
97:32
and pooling resources in the real world
97:35
- this is the hub Islington
97:40
it's a workspace for social
97:43
entrepreneurs people who want to make
97:47
the world a better place come here to
97:49
work they all share the same workspace
97:52
and while each business is different
97:54
they spend plenty of time chatting and
97:57
exchanging ideas the hub concept has
98:01
spread around the whole world and now
98:04
there are over 30 hubs across five
98:06
continents with over 5,000 members the
98:11
hub is a global network built on the
98:13
idea that people work more efficiently
98:16
when they collaborate Anna levy has been
98:33
working for the hub for two and a half
98:35
years over that time she has worked with
98:38
many different business people on a
98:40
variety of social projects the hub is a
98:44
network it's a global network of social
98:47
entrepreneurs and freelancers people
98:49
that are starting their own business and
98:51
working on projects that have some kind
98:52
of social good social or environmental
98:54
impact and we have a space here two
98:57
hobbies LinkedIn is a co-working space
98:59
and we provide the spaces and the
99:01
network and the opportunities to be
99:04
inspired with events and to help people
99:06
launch their projects Anna is a hub host
99:10
which means she provides support to each
99:13
and every person that comes to the hub
99:16
there's all sorts people from very very
99:19
diverse backgrounds different kinds of
99:23
skills and experience and sectors so for
99:26
media we have web design consultants of
99:33
various sorts and campaigners people
99:36
from lots of different backgrounds but
99:38
the thing that pulls people together and
99:40
the reason the hub is different from
99:42
other co-working spaces is that we're
99:44
very much focused on organizations that
99:47
have some kind of a social or
99:48
environmental impact so people want to
99:51
change the world for the better one way
99:53
or another
99:53
of him the hub provides a great
99:57
alternative to working from home
99:59
it offers freelancers a lively social
100:02
environments as well as access to office
100:04
equipment which is often too expensive
100:06
to buy it's a million times better than
100:10
working from home for a start and it's a
100:13
lot more sociable so a lot of people
100:14
that come to the hub have been working
100:16
at home for maybe one or two years and
100:19
they're going crazy with loneliness and
100:23
they have nobody to share ideas with and
100:27
so just from the perspective and the
100:30
social perspective it's it's a lot
100:32
better that you also have access to
100:36
resources that you wouldn't have at home
100:39
so like a printer and things like that
100:42
and scanner and mailbox and the sort of
100:47
things that you need when you start a
100:49
business and the sort of thing that
100:50
you're used to having in a traditional
100:52
office people come to the hub because
100:55
they want to work but it also allows
100:57
them to share they share resources
101:00
equipment and information with one
101:03
another places like the hub are right at
101:07
the heart of the sharing economy the
101:10
sharing economy the way I see it anyway
101:13
it's about kind of collaborative
101:18
consumption so using resources the
101:26
resources that we have rather than
101:28
trying to create more unnecessary
101:30
resource so for example things like and
101:35
there's a website called free cycle
101:37
where people share things that they
101:41
don't want anymore and they kind of and
101:43
other people can can bid for them and
101:45
can can and can can take home you know
101:48
someone else's TV or something like that
101:49
or lyft share things like that so that
101:52
people sharing cars to to work or enter
101:57
on their travels so it's yeah it's
101:59
really so it's really about sharing or
102:02
dwindling resources in the world
102:05
but there are so many other added
102:06
benefits as well it's just the fact that
102:08
you know you get something for free or
102:10
cheaper or you know you're not creating
102:12
unnecessary waste the hub places a great
102:16
deal of importance on cooperation and
102:18
sustainability ideals which sum up the
102:22
sharing economy in a lot of ways the hub
102:26
is proof that we can collaborate not
102:28
only in the way we consume but in the
102:30
way we work and produce too
