## [Plot summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Teapot)

A porcelain teapot rules the tea table. She is very proud of her handle and spout, but not quite so proud of her lid (which is cracked). She is very proud of holding the tea leaves and of being the one to pour forth her contents for thirsty humankind. One day, the teapot is dropped and the handle and spout are broken. She is given to a beggar woman who fills her with soil and plants a flowering bulb within her. The teapot then feels a happiness she has never known. At the last, the teapot is broken in two, the bulb removed to a bigger pot, and the teapot thrown away. She cherishes her memories.

## 正文 as is

There was a proud teapot--**proud of** its **porcelain**, proud of its long **spout**, proud of its broad **handle**. It had something in front and something behind, the spout in front and the **handle** behind, and it **talked about** that. But it didn't talk about its **lid**; that was **cracked** and had been **riveted**. It had a **flaw**, and one is not **fond of** talking about one's flaws--the others are sure to do that. Cups, **cream pitcher**, and sugar bowl, the whole **tea service**, would be sure to remember more the **frailty** of the lid, and to talk about it, than about the good handle and the excellent spout. And the teapot was **aware of** this.

有一个骄傲的茶壶——骄傲它的瓷器，骄傲它的长壶嘴，骄傲它的宽茶壶柄。它前面有个东西，后面有个东西，喷口在前面，把手在后面，它说的就是这个。但是它没有说它的盖子;门上有裂缝，已经用铆钉固定好了。它有一个缺点，一个人不喜欢谈论自己的缺点——别人肯定会这样做的。茶杯、奶油水罐、糖碗，所有的茶具，一定会记得盖子的弱点，并且谈论它，而不是它的好把柄和极好的壶嘴。茶壶意识到了这一点。

"I know them!" it said to itself. "I am also well aware of my flaw, and I **acknowledge** it. **Therein** lies my **humility**, my **modesty**. We all have flaws, but one also has **talents**. The cups were **given** a handle, the sugar bowl a lid. I, of course, was given both, and one thing in front that they will never **receive**: I was given a spout. That makes me the **queen** of the tea table. The sugar bowl and the the cream pitcher have been **granted** the **privilege** of being **hand-maidens** of **palatability**. But I am the **dispenser**, the **mistress**. I **diffuse** the **blessing** among **thirsting** **humanity**.

“我认识他们!”它自言自语道。“我也很清楚自己的缺点，我承认这一点。这是我的谦逊，我的谦逊。我们都有缺点，但也有天赋。杯子有把手，糖碗有盖子。当然，这两样我都得到了，但有一件事是他们永远不会得到的:我得到了一个喷水口。这使我成了茶几上的女王。糖罐和奶油罐被授予了“美味少女”的特权。但我是分配者，女主人。我把祝福传播给饥渴的人们。在我的内心，中国的叶子是在沸腾的，无味的水里准备的。

All this the teapot said in its **intrepid** **youth**. It stood on the **ready-laid** table. It was **lifted** by the most **delicate** hand. But the most delicate hand was **clumsy**: the teapot **fell**, the spout **broke off**, and the handle broke off. The lid is not **worth** **mentioning**--enough has been said about that. The teapot lay in a **swoon** on the floor, the boiling water **running out of** it. It had received a **hard blow**. And the hardest blow of all was that they **laughed at** it, and not at the clumsy hand.

这一切都是茶壶在他年轻无畏的时候说的。它立在已经摆好的桌子上。最灵巧的手把它举起来了。但最纤巧的手却笨手笨脚:茶壶掉了下来，壶嘴断了，壶柄也断了。壶盖不值一提——这已经说得够多了。茶壶昏倒在地板上，开水从茶壶里流出来。它受到了沉重的打击。最沉重的打击是他们嘲笑它，而不是嘲笑那只笨拙的手。

"That memory I will never **lose**," said the teapot when it later **related** the **course** of its life to itself. "I was called an **invalid** and **put over** in a corner, and **on the following day** I was **given away** to a woman who came **begging for** **drippings**. I **sank** down into **destitution**, stood **speechless**, both **inside and out**. But as I stood there my better life began. You are one thing and **turn into** quite another. **Dirt** was put inside me. To a teapot this is the same as being **buried**, but a flower **bulb** was put in the dirt. Who put it there, who gave it I do not now. It was given a **compensation** for the Chinese leaves and the boiling water a compensation for the **broken-off** handle and spout. And the bulb lay in the dirt, the bulb lay inside me. It became my heart, my **living** heart. I had never had one like that before. **There was life in me**, there was **vigor** and **vitality**; the **pulse** **beat**, the bulb **sprouted**. It was **bursting** with **thoughts** and **emotions**. It **bloomed**. I saw it, I **bore** it, I **forgot myself in** its **loveliness**. How **blessed** it is to forget oneself in others! It did not thank me. It did not think of me: it was **admired** and **praised**. I was so happy because of that: how happy it must have been then. One day I heard someone say that it **deserved** a better pot. I was broken in two. It hurt **terribly**, but the flower was put in a better pot--and I was **thrown** out in the yard, to **lie** there like an old **fragment**. But I have a memory that I cannot **lose**."

“这种记忆我永远也不会忘记，”茶壶在后来讲述它的生命历程时这样说。我被称为病人，放在屋角里。第二天，有人把我交给一个讨饭的妇人。我陷入了贫困，站在那里说不出话来，里里外外。但就在我站在那里的时候，我的美好生活开始了。你是一个人，却变成另一个人。我的内心充满了肮脏。对茶壶来说，这和埋茶壶是一样的，只是在泥土里放了一个球茎。是谁放的，是谁给的，我现在不知道。它得到了中国树叶的补偿，沸水得到了断柄和壶嘴的补偿。灯泡躺在泥土里，灯泡躺在我的身体里。它变成了我的心，我活着的心。我以前从来没有过这样的车。我有生命，有生机和活力;脉搏跳动，灯泡发芽了。它充满了思想和感情。它盛开。我看见它，我忍受它，我陶醉在它的可爱中。在别人身上忘记自己是多么幸运啊!它没有感谢我。它没有想到我，反而受到了赞赏和赞扬。正因为如此，我才那么高兴。有一天，我听到有人说，它应该得到一个更好的盆。我把它扔到院子里去，像一块破布似的躺在那里。但我有一个记忆，我不能失去。

## [Translation by jean hersholt](https://andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/hersholt/TheTeapot_e.html)

There was a proud Teapot, proud of being made of porcelain, proud of its long spout and its broad handle. It had something in front of it and behind it; the spout was in front, and the handle behind, and that was what it talked about. But it didn't mention its lid, for it was cracked and it was riveted and full of defects, and we don't talk about our defects - other people do that. The cups, the cream pitcher, the sugar bowl - in fact, the whole tea service - thought much more about the defects in the lid and talked more about it than about the sound handle and the distinguished spout. The Teapot knew this.

"I know them," it told itself. "And I also know my imperfections, and I realize that in that very knowledge is my humility and my modesty. We all have many defects, but then we also have virtues. The cups have a handle, the sugar bowl has a lid, but of course I have both, and one thing more, one thing they can never have; I have a spout, and that makes me the queen of the tea table. The sugar bowl and the cream pitcher are permitted to be serving maids of delicacies, but I am the one who gives forth, the adviser. I spread blessings abroad among thirsty mankind. Inside of me the Chinese leaves give flavor to boiling, tasteless water."

This was the way the Teapot talked in its fresh young life. It stood on the table that was prepared for tea and it was lifted up by the most delicate hand. But that most delicate hand was very awkward. The Teapot was dropped; the spout broke off, and the handle broke off; the lid is not worth talking about; enough has been said about that. The Teapot lay in a faint on the floor, while the boiling water ran out of it. It was a great shock it got, but the worst thing of all was that the others laughed at it - and not at the awkward hand.

"I'll never be able to forget that!" said the Teapot, when later on it talked to itself about its past life. "They called me an invalid, and stood me in a corner, and the next day gave me to a woman who was begging for food. I fell into poverty, and was speechless both outside and inside, but as I stood there my better life began. One is one thing and then becomes quite another. They put earth in me, and for a Teapot that's the same as being buried, but in that earth they planted a flower bulb. Who put it there and gave it to me, I don't know; but it was planted there, a substitution for the Chinese leaves and the boiling water, the broken handle and spout. And the bulb lay in the earth, inside of me, and it became my heart, my living heart, a thing I never had before. There was life in me; there were power and might; my pulse beat. The bulb put out sprouts; thoughts and feeling sprang up and burst forth into flower. I saw it, I bore it, and I forgot myself in its beauty. It is a blessing to forget oneself in others!

"It didn't thank me, it didn't even think of me - everybody admired it and praised it. It made me very happy; how much more happy it must have made it!

"One day I heard them say it deserved a better pot. They broke me in two - that really hurt - and the flower was put into a better pot; then they threw me out into the yard, where I lie as an old potsherd. But I have my memory; that I can never lose!"
