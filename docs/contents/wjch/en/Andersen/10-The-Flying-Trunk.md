## 正文 as is

There was once a **merchant**; he was so rich that he could pave the whole street, and most of a little **alleyway** too, with silver money. But he didn't do it; he knew of other ways to use his money. If he spent a **shilling**, he got back a **daler**. That's the sort of merchant he was--and then he died.

- shilling 英 [ˈʃɪlɪŋ] 美 [ˈʃɪlɪŋ] n. 先令
- daler ?

从前有一个商人;他很有钱，可以用银元铺满整条街，甚至整条小巷的大部分。但他没有这样做;他知道还有其他方式来使用他的钱。如果他花了一先令，就会得到一大笔钱。他就是这样一个商人——后来他死了。

Now the son got all this money, and he lived **merrily**--going to **masquerade** **balls** every night, making paper kites out of **rixdaler** **bills**, and playing **ducks and drakes** on the lake with golden coins **instead** of stones. So I **daresay** the money could go, and go it did. At last he had no more than four shillings left, and he had no other clothes than a pair of slippers and an old **bathrobe**. His friends no longer **bothered** about him now, as, indeed, they couldn't walk down the street together. But one of them, who was kind, sent him an old trunk and said, "**Pack** it!" Now, that was all very well, but he had nothing to pack, and so he **seated** himself in the **trunk**.

现在，儿子得到了所有的钱，他过着快乐的生活——每天晚上去参加化装舞会，用纸币做纸风筝，用金币而不是石头玩打水漂游戏。所以我敢说，他的钱很快就会花完。最后，他只剩下四个先令了，除了一双拖鞋和一件旧浴衣外，他没有别的衣服。他的朋友们现在不再为他操心了，因为他们确实不能一起在街上走。但是其中一个好心的人，给了他一只旧箱子，说:“打包!”现在，一切都很好，但他没有什么东西可以收拾，所以他坐在箱子里。

It was a funny trunk. As soon as you **pressed** the lock, the trunk could fly--and fly it did! Whoops! It flew up through the chimney with him, high above the clouds, farther and farther away. The bottom **creaked**, and he was afraid it would go to pieces, for then he would have made quite a big **jolt**! Heaven help us! And then he came to the land of the Turks. He hid the trunk in the woods under the dried leaves and then went into the town. He could do this easily, for among the Turks everyone, of course, walked around like he did, in a bathrobe and slippers. Then he met a nurse with a baby.

这是一个有趣的箱子。只要你一按下锁，箱子就会飞起来——它确实飞起来了!哎呀!它和他一起从烟囱里飞出来，飞得比云还高，越飞越远。箱底嘎吱一声响了，他担心箱子会碎，因为那样的话，他就会颠得很厉害!上帝保佑我们!然后他来到了土耳其人的土地。他把箱子藏在树林里的干树叶下面，然后就进城去了。他很容易做到这一点，因为在土耳其人当中，当然每个人都像他一样穿着浴衣和拖鞋四处走动。然后他遇到了一个带着婴儿的护士。

"listen, you **Turkish** nurse," he said, " what big castle is this close to the city? The windows are so high!"

- Turkish adj. 土耳其的；土耳其人的，土耳其语的；突厥诸语言的 n. 土耳其语

“谢谢!”商人的儿子说。于是他走进树林，坐进箱子，飞上屋顶，从窗口爬了进去。

She was lying on the sofa asleep. She was so lovely that the merchant's son had to kiss her. She woke up and was quite terrified, but he said that he was the God of the Turks, who had come down to her through the air, and she liked that very much.

Then they sat next to each other, and he told her **tales** about her eyes: they were the loveliest **dark** pools, and her thoughts **swarm** about there like **mermaids**.

于是他们就挨在一起坐着。他给她讲关于她的眼睛的故事:它们是最美丽的黑潭，她的思想像人鱼一样在那里游来游去。他告诉她关于她的前额的事情:那是一座白雪皑皑的山，有最宏伟的宫殿和图画。他告诉她关于鹳带来了可爱的小婴儿。

But see to it that you know a really lovely story, for my parents are especially fond of them. My mother likes it to be moral and decorous, while my father likes it jolly, so you can laugh!"

"There was once a bunch of matches that were so exceedingly proud of their high descent. Their family tree--that is to say, the big fir tree of which each one was a tiny stick--had been a huge old tree in the forest.

"Yes, when we lived high on the green branch," they said, "we were really living high! Every morning and evening, diamond tea--that was teh dew. All day we had sunshine--when the sun was shining--and all the little birds had to tell us stories. We were very well aware that we were rich too, for the leafy trees were clad only in the summer, but our family could afford green clothes both summer and winter. But then came the woodcutters--that was the Great Revolution--and our family was split up. The head of the family was given a post as the mainmast on a splendid ship that could sail around the world0--if it wanted to. The other branches ended up in other places, and it is now our task to provide light for the rank and file. That's why people of rank like ourselves happen to be in the kitchen."

“是的，当我们住在高高的绿树枝上的时候，”他们说，“我们真的住得很高!每天早晚，钻石茶——那是露水。我们整天都有阳光——当太阳照耀的时候——所有的小鸟都给我们讲故事。我们很清楚，我们也很富有，因为树叶只在夏天才有衣服穿，而我们家在夏天和冬天都买得起绿色的衣服。但后来出现了伐木工人——这就是伟大的革命——我们的家庭分裂了。一家之主被分配了一个职位，作为一艘华丽轮船的主桅。这艘船可以环游世界——如果它愿意的话。其他的分支在其他地方结束了，现在我们的任务是为普通员工提供光明。这就是为什么像我们这样地位高的人碰巧在厨房里的原因。”

"Well, it's been different with me!" said the iron pot, which was lying beside the **matches**. "Ever since I came out into the world, I've been **scoured** and boiled many times! I **attend** to the **substantial** things, and as a **matter** of fact, I really come first in this house. My only joy--next to the table--is to lie nice and clean on the shelf and carry on a **sensible** chat with my **companions**. But--with the **exception** of the water pail, which **occasionally** goes down in the yard--we always live indoor. Our only news **bringer** is the market basket, but it talks so **alarmingly** about the government and the people. Yes, the other day and **elderly** pot was so upset by it all that it fell down and broke to bits! That's **liberalism**, I tell you!"

“唉，我的情况就不一样了!”躺在柴火旁边的那个铁罐子说。“自从我来到这个世界上，我已经被擦洗和煮过很多次了!”我关心的是实质性的事情，事实上，在这所房子里，我真的是第一位的。我唯一的乐趣——就在桌子旁边——就是舒舒服服地躺在架子上，与同伴们进行理智的交谈。但是——除了偶尔会从院子里掉下来的水桶——我们都住在室内。我们唯一能带来新闻的是“市场篮子”(market basket)，但它谈论的是政府和人们，令人担忧。是的，有一天，老壶被这一切弄得心烦意乱，摔得粉碎!我告诉你，那是自由主义!”

罐子继续讲故事，故事的结尾和开头一样好。

All the plates rattled with delight, and the mop took green parsley out of the sand bin and crowned the pot with it, for it knew this would irritate the others. 'And if I crown her today,' it said, 'then she'll crown me tomorrow!'

"Well, I want to dance," said the fire tongs, and dance she did. Yes, heaven help us, how she could lift one leg up in the air! The old chair cover over in the corner split just from looking at it. "May I be crowned too?" said the fire tongs, and then she was.

窗户上放着一支旧鹅毛笔，那是女仆常用来写字的。它没有什么特别之处，只是在墨水瓶里浸得太深了。但正因为如此，它现在才装腔作势。“如果茶炊不唱歌，”它说，“那就不唱了。外面笼子里挂着一只夜莺。它可以唱歌。可以肯定的是，没有人教过它，但是我们今天晚上不打算诽谤它!”

"I'm simply vexed!" said the market basket. "I'm as deeply vexed as anyone can imagine! Is this a fitting way to spend an evening? Wouldn't it be better to put the house to rights? Then everyone would find his place, and I'd run the whole caboodle! Then there'd be another song and dance!"

- vexed 英 [vekst] 美 [vekst] adj. 生气的，烦恼的，恼怒的；为难的；焦急的

"Yes, let's **raise** a **rumpus**!" they all said. At the same moment the door opened. It was the maid, and so they stood still. There wasn't a deep out of anyone. But there wasn't a pot there that didn't know what it was **capable** of doing or how **distinguished** it was.

"Yes, if only I'd wanted to," each thought, "it really would have been a lively evening!"

- lively 英 [ˈlaɪvli] 美 [ˈlaɪvli] adj. 活泼的；生动的；真实的；生气勃勃的

“这真是一个有趣的故事!”王后说。“我觉得自己就像在厨房里拿着火柴一样! 是的，现在你可以拥有我们的女儿了!”

It was truly magnificent.

真的很壮观。

"Well, I guess I'd better see about doing something too," thought the merchant's son, and then he bought rockets, torpedoes, and all the fireworks you can imagine, put them in his trunk, and flew up in the air with them.

“好吧，我想我最好也做点什么，”商人的儿子想，然后他买了火箭、鱼雷和所有你能想象得到的烟花，把它们放在他的箱子里，和它们一起飞到空中。

SWOOOOOOOOSH! How they went off! And how they popped!

- swosh 嗖嗖地动

As soon as the merchant's son had come back down in the forest again with his trunk, he thought, "I'll just go into the city to find out how it looked!" And of course it was only reasonable that he wanted to do that.

- reasonable 英 [ˈriːznəbl] 美 [ˈriːznəbl] adj. 合理的，公道的；通情达理的

商人的儿子带着他的箱子又回到森林里来了。他想:“我要到城里去看看，看看箱子究竟是什么样子。”当然，他这样做是合理的。

My, how people were talking! Every last person he asked had seen it, in his own fashion, but they all thought it had been delightful!


天啊，人们都说些什么呀!他问的每一个人都以他自己的方式看过它，但是他们都认为它是令人愉快的!

Indeed, those were delightful things he heard, and on the following day he was to be married.

他听了这些话，真是高兴极了。第二天，他就要结婚了。

Now he went back to the forest to seat himself in the trunk--but where was it?

现在他回到森林里去，坐到箱子里去。可是箱子在什么地方呢?

The trunk had burned up! A spark from the fireworks had **remained** and set it on fire, and the trunk was in ashes. No longer could he fly, no longer could he come to his bride.

- remain 英 [rɪˈmeɪn] 美 [rɪˈmeɪn] vi. 保持；依然；留下；剩余；逗留；残存 n. 遗迹；剩余物，残骸

- bride 英 [braɪd] 美 [braɪd] n. 新娘；姑娘，女朋友

箱子烧掉了!烟火留下的火星把箱子点着了，箱子也成了灰烬。他再也不能飞了，再也不能到他的新娘那里去了。

She stood all day on the roof and waited. She's waiting still while he's wandering about the world telling stories. But they're no longer as gay as the one he told about the matches.

- wandering 英 ['wɒnd(ə)rɪŋ] 美 ['wɑndərɪŋ] adj. 流浪的；漫游的；徘徊的；蜿蜒的 n. 闲逛；离题；神志恍惚 v. 漫游；偏移；蜿蜒；漫步于（某地）；（对固定性伴侣）不忠（wander 的现在分词）
- gay 英 [ɡeɪ] 美 [ɡeɪ] adj. 快乐的；放荡的；艳丽的

她整天站在屋顶上等着。当他在世界各地讲故事时，她还在等待。但他们已经不像他说的那场比赛那么快乐了。

她在屋顶上等待了一整天。她现在还在那儿等待着哩。而他呢，他在这个茫茫的世界里跑来跑去讲儿童故事;不过这些故事再也不像他所讲的那个“柴火的故事”一样有趣。

我觉得，”茶壶说——“他是厨房的歌手，同时也是茶壶的异母兄弟——我们要听这样一只外国鸟唱歌是非常不对的。这算是爱国吗?让上街的菜篮来评判一下吧?”

 “我有点烦恼，”菜篮说。“谁也想象不到我内心里是多么烦恼!这能算得上是晚上的消遣吗?把我们这个家整顿整顿一下岂不是更好吗?请大家各归原位，让我来布置整个的游戏吧。这样，事情才会改变!”

 “是的，我们来闹一下吧!”大家齐声说。

 正在这时候，门开了。女佣人走进来了，大家都静静地站着不动，谁也不敢说半句话。不过在他们当中，没有哪一只壶不是满以为自己有一套办法，自己是多么高贵。“只要我愿意，”每一位都是这样想，“这一晚可以变得很愉快!”

 女佣人拿起柴火，点起一把火。天啦!火烧得多么响!多么亮啊!

 “现在每个人都可以看到，”他们想，“我们是头等人物。我们照得多么亮!我们的光是多么大啊!”——于是他们就都烧完了。

 “这是一个出色的故事!”王后说。“我觉得自己好像就在厨房里，跟柴火在一道。是的，我们可以把女儿嫁给你了。”

 “是的，当然!”国王说，“你在星期一就跟我们的女儿结婚吧。”

 他们用“你”来称呼他，因为他现在是属于他们一家的了。(注：按照外国人的习惯，对于亲近的人用“你”而不是用“您”来称呼。)

 举行婚礼的日子已经确定了。在结婚的头天晚上，全城都大放光明。饼干和点心都随便在街上散发给群众。小孩子用脚尖站着，高声喊“万岁!”同时用手指吹起口哨来。真是非常热闹。

 “是的，我也应该让大家快乐一下才对!”商人的儿子想。因此他买了些焰火和炮竹，以及种种可以想象得到的鞭炮。他把这些东西装进箱子里，于是向空中飞去。

 “啪!”放得多好!放得多响啊!

 所有的土耳奇人一听见就跳起来，弄得他们的拖鞋都飞到耳朵旁边去了。他们从来没有看见过这样的火球。他们现在知道了，要跟公主结婚的人就是土耳奇的神。

 商人的儿子坐着飞箱又落到森林里去，他马上想，“我现在要到城里去一趟，看看这究竟产生了什么效果。”他有这样一个愿望，当然也是很自然的。

 嗨，老百姓讲的话才多哩!他所问到的每一个人都有自己的一套故事。不过大家都觉得那是很美的。

 “我亲眼看到那位土耳奇的神，”一个说：“他的眼睛像一对发光的星星，他的胡须像起泡沫的水!”

 “他穿着一件火外套飞行，”另外一个说：“许多最美丽的天使藏在他的衣褶里向外窥望。”

 是的，他所听到的都是最美妙的传说。在第二天他就要结婚了。

 他现在回到森林里来，想坐进他的箱子里去。不过箱子到哪儿去了呢?箱子被烧掉了。焰火的一颗火星落下来，点起了一把火。箱子已经化成灰烬了。他再也飞不起来了。也没有办法到他的新娘子那儿去。

 她在屋顶上等待了一整天。她现在还在那儿等待着哩。而他呢，他在这个茫茫的世界里跑来跑去讲儿童故事;不过这些故事再也不像他所讲的那个“柴火的故事”一样有趣。

## [a translation by jean hersholt](https://andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/hersholt/TheFlyingTrunk_e.html)*

There once was a merchant so wealthy that he could have paved a whole street with silver, and still have had enough left over to pave a little alley. But he did nothing of the sort. He knew better ways of using his money than that. If he parted with pennies they came back to him as crowns. That's the sort of merchant he was-and then he died.

Now his son got all the money, and he led a merry life, went to masquerades every night, made paper dolls out of banknotes, and played ducks and drakes at the lake with gold pieces instead of pebbles. This makes the money go, and his inheritance was soon gone. At last he had only four pennies, and only a pair of slippers and a dressing gown to wear.

Now his former friends didn't care for him any more, as he could no longer appear in public with them, but one of them was so good as to send him an old trunk, with the hint that he pack and be off. This was all very well, but he had nothing to pack, so he sat himself in it.

It was no ordinary trunk. Press on the lock and it would fly. And that's just what it did. Whisk! It flew up the chimney, and over the clouds, and away through the skies. The bottom of it was so creaky that he feared he would fall through it, and what a fine somersault he would have made then! Good gracious! But at long last he came down safely, in the land of the Turks. He hid his trunk under some dry leaves in the woods, and set off toward the nearest town. He could do so very well, for the Turks all wear dressing gowns and slippers, just as he did.

When he passed a nurse with a child, he said, "Hello, Turkish nurse. Tell me, what's that great big palace at the edge of town? The one that has its windows up so high."

"That's where the Sultan's daughter lives," said the nurse. "It has been foretold that she will be unhappy when she falls in love, so no one is ever permitted to visit her except in the presence of her mother and father."

"Thank you," said the merchant's son. Back he went to the woods, sat in his trunk, and whisked off to the roof of the palace. From there, he climbed in at the Princess's window.

She lay fast asleep on a sofa, and she looked so lovely that the merchant's son couldn't help kissing her. She woke up and was terribly frightened, but he told her he was a Turkish prophet, who had sailed through the air just to see her. This pleased her very much.

As they sat there, side by side, he told her stories about her eyes. He said they were beautifully dark, deep lakes in which her thoughts went swimming by like mermaids. He told her about her forehead, which he compared to a snow-covered mountainside with its many wonderful halls and pictures. Then he told her about the stork, which brings lovely little children from over the sea. Oh, they were such pretty stories! Then he asked her to marry him, and the Princess said yes, right away.

"But you must come on Saturday," she told him, "when my mother and father will be here to have tea with me. They will be so proud when I tell them I am going to marry a prophet. But be sure you have a really pretty tale to tell them, for both my parents love stories. My mother likes them to be elevating and moral, but my father likes them merry, to make him laugh."

"I shall bring no other wedding present than a fairy tale," he told her, and so they parted. But first the Princess made him a present of a gold saber all covered with gold pieces, and this came in very handy.

He flew away, bought himself a new dressing gown, and went to the woods to invent a fairy tale. That wasn't so easy. However, he had it ready promptly on Saturday. The Sultan, his wife and the whole court awaited him at the Princess's tea party. They gave him a splendid reception.

"Won't you tell us a story?" said the Sultan's wife. "One that is instructive and thoughtful."

"One that will make us laugh, too," said the Sultan.

"To be sure," he said, and started his story. Now listen closely.

"There once was a bundle of matches, and they were particularly proud of their lofty ancestry. Their family tree-that is to say, the great pine tree of which they were little splinters-had been a great old tree in the forest. As the matches lay on the kitchen shelf, they talked of their younger days to the tinder box and an old iron pot beside them.

" 'When we were a part of the green branches,' they said, 'then we really were on a green branch! Every morning and evening we were served the diamond tea that is called dew drops. We had sunshine all day long, and the little birds had to tell us stories. It was plain to see that we were wealthy, for while the other trees' garments lasted only the summer, our family could afford to wear green clothes all the year round. But then the woodcutters came, there was a big revolution, and our family was broken up. The chief support of our family got a place as the mainmast of a fine ship, that could sail around the world if need be. The other branches were scattered in different directions, and now our task is to bring light to the lower classes. That's the reason we distinguished people came to this kitchen.'

" 'My lot has been quite different,' said the iron pot, who stood next to the matches. 'From the moment I came into this world, I've known little but cooking and scouring, day in, day out. I look after the solid and substantial part, and am in fact the most important thing in the house. My only amusement comes when dinner is over. Then, clean and tidy, I take my place here to have a sound conversation with my associates. But except for the watering pot, who now and then makes excursions into the yard, we always live indoors. Our only source of news is the market basket, and he speaks most alarmingly about the government and the people. Why, just the other day an old conservative pot was so upset that he fell down and burst. That basket is a liberal, I tell you!'

" 'You talk too much,' the tinder box flashed sparks from his flint. 'Let's have a pleasant evening.'

" 'Yes, let's talk about who among us is most aristocratic,' said the matches.

" 'No. I don't like to talk about myself,' said the earthenware crock. 'Let's have some entertainment this evening. I'll begin. I'll tell you the sort of things we already know. That won't tax our imaginations, and it is so amusing. By the Baltic sea, by the beech trees of Denmark-'

" 'That's a very pretty beginning,' the plates chattered. 'That's just the kind of story we like.'

" 'There I passed my youth in a quiet home, where they polished the furniture, and swept the floor, and hung up fresh curtains every fourteenth day!'

" 'How well you tell a story!' said the broom. 'You can hear right away that it's a woman who tells it. There's not a speck of dirt in it.'

" 'Yes, one feels that,' said the water pail, and made a happy little jump so the water splashed on the floor.

" 'The crock went on with her story, and the end was as good as the beginning.

"All the plates clattered for joy. The broom made a wreath of parsley to crown the crock, because she knew how that would annoy the others. And the broom thought, 'If I crown her tonight, she will crown me tomorrow.'

"'Now I'll do a dance,' said the fire tongs, and dance she did. Yes, good heavens, how she could kick one of her legs up in the air! The old chair cover in the corner split to see it. 'Will you crown me too?' said the tongs, so they gave her a wreath.

" 'What a common mob,' said the matches.

" 'The tea pot was asked to sing, but she had a cold in her throat. She said nothing short of boiling water could make her sing, but that was sheer affectation. She wished to sing only for the ladies and gentlemen in the drawing room.

"On the window sill was an old quill pen that the servant used. There was nothing remarkable about him except that he had been dipped too deep in the ink, but in that difference he took pride.

" 'The tea pot can sing or not, as she pleases,' he declared. 'In a cage, outside my window, there's a nightingale who will sing for us. He hasn't practiced for the occasion, but tonight we won't be too critical.'

" 'I find it highly improper,' said the tea kettle, who was the official kitchen singer, and a half-sister of the tea pot. 'Why should we listen to a foreign bird? Is that patriotic? Let the market basket make the decision.

" 'I am most annoyed,' said the market basket. 'I am more annoyed than anyone can imagine. Is this any way to spend an evening? Wouldn't it be better to call the house to order? Everyone take his appointed place, and I shall run the whole game. That will be something quite different.'

" 'Yes. Let us all make a noise,' they clamored.

"Just then the servant opened the door, and they stood stock-still. Not one had a word to say. But there was not a pot among them who did not know what he could do, and how well qualified he was. 'If I had wanted to,' each one thought, 'we could have a gay evening. No question about it!'

" 'The servant girl took the matches and struck a light with them. My stars, how they sputtered and flared!

" 'Now,' they thought, 'everyone can see we are the first. How brilliant we are! What a light we spread.' Then they burned out."

"That was a delightful story," said the Sultan's wife. "I felt myself right in the kitchen with the matches. My dear prophet, thou shalt certainly marry our daughter."

"Yes indeed," said the Sultan. "Thou shalt marry her on Monday." They said "Thou" to him now, for he was soon to be one of the family.

So the wedding day was set, and on the evening that preceded it the whole city was gay with lights. Cookies and cakes were thrown among the people. The boys in the street stood on tiptoe. They shouted, "Hurrah!" and whistled through their fingers. It was all so grand.

"I suppose I really ought to do something too," said the merchant's son. So he bought firecrackers, and rockets, and fireworks of every sort, loaded his trunk with them, and flew over the town.

Pop! went the crackers, and swoosh! went the rockets. The Turks jumped so high that their slippers flopped over their ears. Such shooting stars they never had seen. Now they could understand that it was the prophet of the Turks himself who was to marry their Princess.

As soon as the merchant's son came down in the woods, he thought, "I'll go straight to the town to hear what sort of impression I made." It was the natural thing to do.

Oh, what stories they told! Every last man he asked had his own version, but all agreed it had been fine. Very fine!

"I saw the prophet himself," said one. "His eyes shone like stars, and his beard foamed like water."

"He was wrapped in a fiery cloak," said another. "The heads of beautiful angels peeped out of the folds of it."

Yes, he heard wonderful things, and his wedding was to be on the following day. He went back to the woods to rest in his trunk-but what had become of it? The trunk was burned! A spark from the fireworks had set it on fire, and now the trunk was burned to ashes. He couldn't fly any more. He had no way to reach his bride. She waited for him on the roof, all day long. Most likely she is waiting there still. But he wanders through the world, telling tales which are not half so merry as that one he told about the matches.
