## As-is

In China, you know of course, the emperor is Chinese, and everyone he has around him is Chinese too. Now this happened many years ago, but that is just why the story is worth hearing, before it is forgotten. The emperor's palace was the most magnificent in the world. It was made entirely of fine porcelain, so precious and so fragile and delicate that one really had to watch one's step. In the garden the most unusual flowers were to be seen, and the most beautiful had fastened to them silver bells that tinkled so that no one would go past without noticing them. Yes, everything had been very well thought out in the emperor's garden, and it stretched so far that even the gardener didn't know where it stopped. If one kept on walking, one came to the loveliest forest with great trees and deep lakes. The forest stretched all the way down to the sea, which was blue and so deep that great ships could sail right in under the branches. And in these branches lived a nightingale that sang so sweetly that even the poor fisherman, who had so many other things to keep him busy, lay still and listened when he was out at night pulling in his net.

在中国，你当然知道，皇帝是中国人，他身边的每个人也是中国人。这发生在许多年前，但这正是为什么这个故事值得一听，在它被遗忘之前。皇帝的宫殿是世界上最宏伟的。它完全是用上等瓷器制成的，非常珍贵，非常脆弱，非常精致，人们不得不小心翼翼地走好每一步。花园里种着许多稀奇古怪的花，最美丽的花都系上了银铃，这些银铃丁当地响着，谁经过都不会不注意的。是的，在皇帝的花园里，每件事情都想得很周到，甚至园丁也不知道它在什么地方停下来。如果你继续走下去，你就会来到一片最美丽的森林，那里有参天大树和深邃的湖泊。森林一直延伸到大海，大海是蓝色的，非常深，大轮船可以在它的枝叶下航行。在这些枝头上，住着一只夜莺，它唱得那么动听，就连那个有那么多事情要忙的可怜的渔夫，晚上在外面收渔网的时候，也躺在那里静静地听着。

"Good heavens! How beautiful!" he said. But then he had to look after his net and forgot the bird, although the next night, when it sang again and the fisherman came out there, he said the same thing: "Good heavens! How beautiful!"

“天啊!多漂亮啊!”他说。但是他不得不照看他的网，忘记了那只鸟，尽管第二天晚上，当它再次歌唱时，渔夫又出来了，他还是说了同样的话:“天哪!多么美丽!”

From every land in the world travelers came to the emperor's city. They admired the city, the palace, and the garden. But when they heard the nightingale, they all said: "But this is really the best thing of all!" And the travelers told about it when they got home, and scholars wrote many books about the city, the palace, and the garden. But they didn't forget the nightingale - it was given the highest place of all. And those who were poets wrote the loveliest poems, each one about the nightingale in the forest by the sea.

- admire /ədˈmaɪər/ vt. 钦佩；赞美 vi. 钦佩；称赞

旅行者从世界各地来到帝都。他们羡慕这座城市、这座宫殿和这座花园。但是当他们听到夜莺的歌声时，他们都说:“这真是一件最美妙的事情!”旅行者们回到家就把这事告诉了他们。学者们写了许多关于这座城市、这座宫殿和这座花园的书。但是他们没有忘记那只夜莺——它是所有动物中最高的。那些诗人写了最美丽的诗，每一首都是关于海边森林里的夜莺的。

These books went around the world, and once some of them came to the emperor. He sat in his golden chair, reading and reading and nodding his head, for he was pleased by the lovely descriptions of the city, the palace, and the garden. "But the nightingale is really the best thing of all" - there it stood in print.

- go around 四处走动；供应；（消息）流传

这些书传遍了世界，有一本还传到了皇帝那里。他坐在他的金椅子上，读着，读着，点着头，因为他对这座城市、这座宫殿和这座花园的可爱的描述使他感到愉快。“但夜莺确实是世界上最好的东西。”——它就印在那里。

"What's that?" said the emperor. "The nightingale? Why, I don't know anything about it! Is there such a bird in my empire, in my very own garden? I have never heard of it before! Fancy having to find this out from a book!"

And then he summoned his chamberlain, who was so grand that if anyone of lower rank dared speak to him or ask about something, he would only say: "P!" And that doesn't mean anything at all.

There is supposed to be a highly remarkable bird here called a nightingale!" said the emperor. "They say it's the very best thing of all in my great kingdom! Why hasn't anyone ever told me about it?"

"I have never heard it mentioned before!" said the chamberlain. "It has never been presented at court!"

"I want it to come here this evening and sing for me," said the emperor. "The whole world knows what I have, and I don't!"

"I have never heard it mentioned before!" said the chamberlain. "I shall look for it! I shall find it!"

But where was it to be found? The chamberlain ran up and down all the stairs, through great halls and corridors. But no one he met had ever heard of th nightingale, and the chamberlain ran back again to the emperor and said it was probably a fable made up by the people who write books. "Your Imperial Majesty shouldn't believe what si written in them. They are inventions and belong to something called black magic!"

"But the book in which I read it was sent to me by the mighty emperor of Japan, so it cannot be false. I will hear the nightingale! It shall be here this evening! I bestow my hightest patronage upon it! And if it doesn't come, I'll have the whole court thumped on their stomachs after they have eaten supper!"

"Tsing-pe!" said the chamberlain, and again ran up and down all the great halls and corridors. And half the court ran with him, for they weren't at all willing to be thumped on their stomachs. They asked and asked about the remarkable nightingale that was known to the whole world but not to the court.

Finally they met a little peasant girl in the kitchen. She said, "The nightingale? Heavens! I know it well. Yes, how it can sing! Every evening I'm permitted to take a few scraps from the table home to my poor sick mother -she lives down by the shore. And on my way back, when I'm tired and stop to rest in the forest, I can hear the nightingale sing. It brings tears to my eyes. It's jus as though my mother were kissing me."

"Little kitchen maid!" said the chamberlain. "You shall have a permanent position in the kitchen and permission to stand and watch the emperor eating if you can lead us to the nightingale. It has been summoned to appear at court this evening."

And so they all set out for the part of the forest where the nightingale usually sang. Half the court went with them. As they were walking along at a fast pace a cow started mooing.

"Oh!" said a courtier. "There it is! Indeed, what remarkable force for so tiny an animal. I am certain I have heard it before."

"No, that's the cow mooing." said the little kitchen maid. "We're still quite a long way from the spot."

Now the frogs started croaking in the marsh.

"Lovely," said the Chinese imperial chaplain. "Now I can hear her. It's just like tiny church bells."

"No, that's the frogs!" said the little kitchen maid. "But now I think we'll soon hear it."

Then the nightingale started to sing.

"That's it!" said the little girl. "Listen! Listen! There it sits!" And then she pointed to a little gray bird up in the branches.

"Is it possible?" said the chamberlain. "I had never imagined it like this. How ordinary it looks! No doubt seeing so many fine people has made it lose its *couleur*!"

"Little nightingale," shouted the little kitchen maid quite loud, "our gracious emperor would so like you to sing for him!"

"With the greatest pleasure," said the nightingale, and sang in a way to warm one's heart.

"It si just like glass bells!" said the chamberlain. "And look at that tiny throat. How it vibrates! It's remarkable that we have never heard it before. It will be a great success at court."

"Shall I sing for the emperor again?" said the nightingale, who thought the emperor was there.

"My enchanting little nightingale," said the chamberlain, "it gives me the greatest pleasure to command you to appear at a court celebration this evening, where you will delight his High Imperial Eminence with your *charmante* song!"

"It sounds best out of doors," said the nightingale, but it followed them gladly when it heard it was the emperor's wish.

The palace had been properly polished up. Walls and floors, which were of porcelain, glowed from the lights of thousands of golden lamps. The loveliest flowers, which really could tinkle, had been lined up in the halls. There was such a running back and forth that it caused a draft that made all the bells tinkle so one couldn't hear oneself think.

In the middle of the great hall, where the emperor sat, a golden perch had been placed for the nightingale to sit on. The whole court was there, and the little kitchen maid had been given permission to stand behind the door, for now she really did have the little of kitchen maid. Everyone was wearing his most splendid attire. They all looked at the little gray bird, to which the emperor was nodding.

And the nightingale sang so sweetly that tears came to the emperor's eyes and rolled down his cheeks. And then the nightingale sang even more sweetly. It went straight to one's heart. And the emperor was so pleased that he said the nightingale was to have his golden slipper to wear around its neck. But the nightingale said no, thank you - it had been rewarded enough.

"I have seen tears in the emperor's eyes. To me, that is the richest treasure. An emperor's tears have a wondrous power. Heaven knows I have been rewarded enough!" And then it sang again with its sweet and blessed voice.

"That is the most adorable *coquetterie* I know of," said the ladies standing around. And then they put water in their mouths so they could gurgle whenever anyone spoke to them, for now they thought that they were nightingales too. Yes, even the lackeys and chambermaids let it be known that they were also satisfied, and that was saying a lot, for they are the hardest to please. Yes indeed, the nightingale had really been a success.

Now it was to remain at court and have its own cage as well as freedom to take a walk outside twice during the day and once at night. It was given twelve servants, too, each one holding tightly to a silken ribbon fastened to its leg. That kind of walk was no pleasure at all.

The whole city talked about the remarkable bird, and whenever two people met, the first merely said "Night!" and the other said "Gale!" And then they sighed and understood each other! Yes, eleven shopkeepers' children were named after it, but not one of them could ever sing a note in his life!

One day a big package came for the emperor. On the outside was written "Nightingale."

"Here's a new book about our famous bird," said the emperor. But it was no book, it was a little work of art in a case: an artificial nightingale made to resemble the real one, except that it was encrusted with diamonds and rubies and sapphires! As soon as the artificial bird was wound up it could sing one of the melodies the real one sang, and then its tail bobbed up and down, glittering with gold and silver. Around its neck hung a ribbon, and on it was written: "The emperor of Japan's nightingale is poor compared to the emperor of China's."

"How lovely!" said everyone. And the person who had brought the artificial nightingale immediately had the title of chief-imperial-nightingale-bringer bestowed upon him.

"Now they must sing together! What a duet that will be!"

And then they had to sing together, but is didn't really come off because the real nightingale sang in its own way and the artificial bird worked mechanically.

"It is not to blame," said the music master. "It keeps time perfectly and according to the rules of my own system!" Then the artificial bird had to sing alone. It was as much of a success as the real one, and besides, it was so much more beautiful to look at: it glittered like bracelets and brooches.

Thirty-three times it sang one and the same melody, and still it wasn't tired. People were only too willing to hear it from the beginning again, but the emperor thought that nwo the living nightingale should also sing a little. But where was it? No one had noticed it fly out of the open window, away to its green forest.

"But what kind of behavior is that?" said the emperor. And all the courtiers berated it and said the nightingale was a most ungrateful bird.

"We still have the best bird," they said, and again the artificial bird had to sing. And it was the thirty-fourth time they had heard the same tune, but they didn't know it all the way through yet, for it was so hard. And the music master praised the bird very highly - yes, even assured them that it was better than the real nightingale, not only as far as its clothes and the many diamonds were concerned, but internally as well.

"You see, my lords and ladies, and your Imperial Majesty above all! You can never figure out what the real nightingale will sing, but with the artificial bird everything had already been decided. This is the way it will be, and not otherwise. It can be accounted for; it can be opened up to reveal teh human logic that has gone into the arrangement of the works, how they operate and how they turn one after the other!"

"Those are my thoughts precisely!" they all said. And on the following Sunday the music master was allowed to show the bird to the people. They were also going to hear it sing, said the emperor. And they heard it and were as happy as if they had all trunk themselves merry on tea, for that is so very Chinese. And then they all said "Oh" and held their index fingers high in the air and nodded. But the poor fisherman, who had heard the real nightingale, said: "It sounds pretty enough, and it is similar too. But something is missing. I don't know what it is."

The real nightingale was banished from the land.

The artificial bird had its place on a silken pillow close to the emperor's bed. All the gifts it had received, gold and precious stones, lay around it, and its title had risen to high-imperial-bedside-table-singer. It ranked  Number One on the left, for the emperor considered the side where the emperor is on the left side too. The music master wrote a treatise in twenty-five volumes about the artificial bird. It was very learned and very long and contained the biggest Chinese words, and all the people said they had read and understood it, for otherwise they would have been considered stupid and would have been thumped on their stomachs.

It went on like this for a whole year. The emperor, the court, and the other Chinese knew every little "cluck" in the song of the artificial bird by heart. But this is why they prized it so highly now: they could sing along with it themselves, and this they did! The street boys sang "Zizizi! Cluck-cluck-cluck!" And the emperor sang it too. Yes, it was certainly lovely.

But one evening, as the artificial bird was singing away and emperor was lying in bed listening to it, something went "Pop!" inside the bird. "Whirrrrrr!" All the wheels went around, and then the music stopped.

The emperor sprang out of bed and had his personal physician summoned. But what good was he? Then they summoned the watchmaker, and after much talk and many examinations of the bird he put it more or less in order again. Nut he said it must be used as sparingly as possible. The cogs were so worn down that it wasn't possible to put in new ones in a way that would be sure to make music. What a great affliction this was! Only once a year did they dare let the artificial bird sing, and even that was hard on it. But then the music master made a little speech, with big words, and said it was just as good as new, and then it was just as good as new.

Five years passed, and then a great sorrow fell upon the land. They were all fond of their emperor, but now he was sick and it was said he could not live. A new emperor had already been picked out, and people stood out int the streeet and asked the chamberlain hwo their emperor was.

"P!" he said, and shook his head.

Cold and pale, the emperor lay in his great magnificent bed. The whole court thought he was dead, and they all ran off to greet the new emperor. The lackeys ran out to talk about it, and the chambermaids had a big tea party. Cloths had been put down n all the halls and corridors to deaden the sound of footsteps. And now it was so quiet, so quiet. But the emperor was not yet dead. Stiff and pale, he lay in the magnificent bed with the long velvet curtains and the heavy gold tassels. High above him a window stood open, and the moon shone in on the emperor and the artificial bird.

The poor emperor could hardly breathe. It was as though something heavy were sitting on his chest. He had put on his golden crown and was holding the emperor's golden sword in one hand and his magnificent banner in the other. All around from the folds of the velvet curtains strange faces were peering out. Some were quite hideous, others so kindly and mild. These were all the emperor's good and wicked deeds that were looking at him now that Death was sitting on his heart.

"Do you remember that?" whispered one after the other. "Do you remember that?" And then they told him so much that the sweat stood out on his forehead.

"I never knew that!" said the emperor. "Music! Music! The big Chinese drum!" he shouted. "So I don't have to hear all the things they're saying!"

But they kept it up, and Death nodded, just the way the Chinese do, at everything that was being said.

"Music! Music!" shrieked the emperor. "Blessed little golden bird, sing now! Sing! I've given you gold and costly presents. I myself hung my golden slipper around your neck. Sing now! Sing!"

But the bird kept silent. There was no one to wind it up, so it didn't sing. But Death kept on looking at the emperor out of his big empty sockets, and it was so quiet, so terribly quiet.

Suddenly the loveliest song could be heard close to the window. It was the little real nightingale sitting on the branch outside. It had heard of the emperor's need and had come to sing him comfort and hope. And as it sang the face became paler and paler, and the blood started flowing faster and faster in the emperor's weak body, and Death himself listened and said, "Keep on, little nightingale, keep on!"

"If you will give me the magnificent golden sword! If you will give me the rich banner! If you will give me the emperor's crown!"

And Death gave each treasure for a song, and the nightingale kept on singing. And it sang about the quiet churchyard where the white roses grow the scent of the older tree perfumes the air and where the fresh grass is watered by the tears of the bereaved. Then Death was filled with longing for his garden and drifted like a cold, white mist out of the window.

"Thank you, thank you!" said the emperor. "Heavenly little bird, I know you, all right. I have driven you out of my land and empire, and still you have sung the bad visions away from my bed and removed Death from my heart! How can I reward you?"

"You have already rewarded me!" said the nightingale. "You gave me the tears from your eyes the first time I sang. I will never forget that. Those are the jewels that do a singer's heart good. But sleep now, and get well and strong. I shall sing for you."

And it sang, and the emperor fell into a sweet sleep, which was calm and beneficial.

The sun was shining in on him through the windows when he awoke, refreshed and healthy. None of his servants had returned yet, for they thought he was dead, but the nightingale still sat there and sand.

"You shall sing only when you yourself want to, and I shall break the artificial bird into a thousand bits!"

"Don't' do that!" said the nightingale. "Why, it has done what good it could. Keep it as before. I cannot build my nest and live at the palace, but let me come whenever I want to. Then in the evening I will sit on the branch here by the window and sing for you. I shall sing about those who are happy and those who suffer. I shall sing of good and evil, which is kept hidden from you. The little songbird flies far, to the poor fisherman, to the farmer's roof, to everyone who is far from you and your court. I love your heart more than your crown, and yet your crown has an odor of sanctity about it. I will come. I will sing for you. But you must promise me one thing!"

"Everything!" said hte emperor, standing there in his imperial robe, which he himself had put on, and holding the heavy golden sword up to his heart.

"One thing I beg of you. Tell no one that you have a little bird that tells you everything! Then things will go even better!"

And then the nightingale flew away.

The servants came in to have a look at their dead emperor. Yes, there they stood, and the emperor said, "Good morning!"

‘How sweet that song is!’ he would sigh whenever he heard it. Travellers from all over the world came to the Emperor’s city to admire his palace and garden.

One day, a gift arrived from the mighty Emperor of Japan. It was one of the books that had been written about the palace and garden. As he sat in his golden chair, the Emperor was delighted to read how beautiful and impressive they were.

- mighty /ˈmaɪti/ adj. 有力的；强有力的；有势力的 adv. 很；极；非常 n. 有势力的人

一天，强大的日本天皇送来了一份礼物。这是一本关于宫殿和花园的书。当他坐在他的金椅子上，皇帝很高兴地读到他们是多么美丽和令人印象深刻。

But when he came to the words ‘…the nightingale is the most beautiful of all’, he looked puzzled.‘Nightingale? I have never heard of a nightingale in my garden!’ he said to his Lord-in-Waiting. ‘How come the whole world knows about this except me?! I want you to find this bird and bring it to me so I can **hear it sing for myself!**’

- How come 为什么；怎么会…(那样)；怎么办；怎么回事

但是当他读到“……夜莺是世界上最美丽的”这句话时，他显得很困惑。“夜莺？我从来没有听说过花园里有夜莺!”他对他的侍从说。“除了我，怎么全世界都知道这件事?!”我要你找到这只鸟，把它带给我，这样我就能听到它为我唱歌了!”

The Lord-in-Waiting looked high and low for the mysterious nightingale. He went up stairs and down, through halls and passages, asking everyone he passed, but no-one had heard of it. Then just as he was about to give up, a little kitchen maid came up to him.

我能听到宫中大人在四处寻找那只神秘的夜莺。他上楼梯，下楼梯，穿过大厅和走廊，问每一个他经过的人，但没有人听说过它。就在他要放弃的时候，一个小厨房女佣走了过来。

‘I know the nightingale!’ she said. ‘Every evening I go home to care for my sick mother who lives by the seashore. When I return to the palace, I stop in the forest to rest and listen to the nightingale’s song. Oh, it’s so lovely it brings tears to my eyes! Come with me, I will take you to her.’ All the palace servants followed as the kitchen maid led the way through the garden. ‘There she is!’ said a young courtier. ‘What a very loud noise for such a small creature!’

- courtier /ˈkɔːrtiər/ n. 朝臣；奉承者；谄媚者
- creature /ˈkriːtʃər/ n. 动物，生物；人；创造物

“我认识夜莺!””她说。“每天晚上我回家照顾住在海边的生病的母亲。当我回到宫殿，我在森林里停下来休息，听夜莺的歌声。哦，它太可爱了，让我热泪盈眶!跟我来，我带你去见她。厨房女佣领着所有的仆人穿过花园。“那就是她!一个年轻的侍臣说。“这么小的动物发出这么大的声音!”

‘That’s a cow, not a nightingale,’ replied the kitchen maid. ‘We have a long way to go yet…’ They carried on walking. ‘I can hear her!’ said a serving girl. ‘Her song sounds like tinkling church bells.’ ‘Hmmm, those are frogs,’ laughed the maid. ‘But quiet now, we’re getting close…’ ‘Look! There she is’, said the maid - and she pointed to a little grey bird perched on the bough of a tree.

“那是一头牛，不是一只夜莺，”厨房女工回答说。“我们还有很长的路要走……”他们继续走着。“我能听见她!”一个女仆说。她的歌听起来就像教堂里叮当作响的钟声。'嗯，那些是青蛙，'女仆笑着说。“可是现在安静了，我们快到了……”“她在那儿，”女仆说——她指了指栖息在树枝上的一只灰色小鸟。

‘What an exquisite sound!’ said the Lord-in-Waiting. ‘But – er - I wasn’t expecting such a small, plain, simple creature. Never mind. Most excellent Nightingale!’ he called out. ‘Our most gracious Emperor wishes you to sing to him. Will you come to the palace with us?’

“多么美妙的声音!”侍臣说。“可是——呃——我没想到会有这么小、这么普通、这么简单的一个动物。不要紧。最优秀的夜莺!”他喊道。“我们最仁慈的皇帝希望您为他唱歌。你愿意和我们一起到宫里去吗?”

‘My song sounds best in the green wood,’ answered the nightingale. ‘But I will do as you ask.’ The palace was specially decorated for the great occasion. The walls and floors of porcelain glittered in the light of a thousand lamps and beautiful flowers with little bells stood in the corridors. In the centre of the great hall was a golden perch for the nightingale to sit on.

“我的歌在绿色的树林里最好听，”夜莺回答说。“但我会照你说的去做。宫殿是专门为这个重要的场合而装饰的。陶瓷的墙壁和地板在一千盏灯的照耀下闪闪发光，走廊上立着带小铃铛的美丽花朵。在大殿的中央有一个金色的栖木，夜莺可以坐在上面。

The whole court was present, including the kitchen maid. As the Emperor nodded to the little grey bird to begin, all eyes turned to watch… The nightingale sang so sweetly that tears started rolling down the Emperor’s cheeks. ‘Oh, how glorious!’ he cried. ‘Please, wear my gold slipper round your neck as a token of my thanks’.

- court /kɔːrt/ n. 法院；球场；朝廷；奉承
- nodded v. 点头；打瞌睡；摇动（nod的过去式）
- glorious  /ˈɡlɔːriəs/ adj. 光荣的；辉煌的；极好的
- token /ˈtəʊkən/ 标志，象征

整个宫廷的人都在场，包括厨房的女仆。当皇帝向这只灰色的小鸟点头示意开始时，所有的眼睛都转过去看……夜莺唱得如此甜美，以至于皇帝的眼泪开始从脸颊上滚落下来。“噢,多么光荣的!”他哭了。“请把我的金拖鞋戴在脖子上，表示我的谢意。”

‘I have seen tears in the Emperor’s eyes,’ answered the nightingale. ‘That is a powerful gift – the greatest of them all’, and she sang even more enchantingly than ever. Everyone loved the nightingale’s singing so much that the Emperor decided she was to stay at the palace.

- gift /ɡɪft/ n. 礼物；天赋；赠品 vt. 赋予；向…赠送
- enchantingly /ɪnˈtʃæntɪŋli/ adv. 夺人心魂地；可爱地，迷人地

“我在皇帝的眼睛里看到过眼泪，”夜莺回答说。“这是一种强大的天赋（同情心、理解...）——是所有天赋中最伟大的天赋。”她唱得比以前更动听了。每个人都非常喜欢夜莺的歌声，所以皇帝决定让她留在皇宫里。

The little bird was placed inside a specially made cage and twice a day she was allowed to fly round the room with a silken string attached to her leg. She may have lost her freedom – but the whole of China was talking about her.

这只小鸟被安置在一个特制的笼子里，每天两次，她可以腿上系着一根丝线，在房间里飞来飞去。她可能已经失去了自由，但整个中国都在谈论她。

Whenever people met, one said ‘nightin’, and the other said ‘gale.’ Then one day, the Emperor received a large parcel with the word ‘Nightingale’ written on it. ‘Ah - another book about our famous bird!’ he said. But when his servants opened it, a magnificent casket was revealed… Inside the casket - was a nightingale. Only this nightingale wasn’t real…

- magnificent /mæɡˈnɪfɪsnt/ adj. 高尚的；壮丽的；华丽的；宏伟的
- casket /ˈkæskɪt/ n. 棺材；骨灰盒；**小箱**
- reveal /rɪˈviːl/ vt. 显示；透露；揭露；泄露

每当人们见面时，一个人说“晚安”，另一个人说“盖尔”。有一天，皇帝收到一个大包裹，上面写着“夜莺”两个字。“啊——又是一本关于我们那只著名的鸟的书!”他说。但是当他的仆人打开它的时候，一个华丽的首饰盒出现了……在首饰盒里面是一只夜莺。只是这只夜莺不是真的……

Made of metal with a key to wind it up, this bird was clockwork. But what a magnificent clockwork bird it was, covered in diamonds, rubies and sapphires with a tail of silver and gold. Round it’s neck was a piece of ribbon with a note. ‘A nightingale from the Emperor of Japan – though it cannot compare with your nightingale,’ the note read.

- clockwork  /ˈklɑːkwɜːrk/ n. 发条装置；钟表装置 adj. 装有发条的；重复的；可预测的；平稳的，有规律的

- ribbon /ˈrɪbən/ n. 带；缎带；（勋章等的）绶带；带状物；勋表 vi. 形成带状 vt. 把…撕成条带；用缎带装饰

这只鸟是用金属制成的，上面有一把钥匙可以上弦。但是，这是一只多么漂亮的发条鸟啊，身上镶满了钻石、红宝石和蓝宝石，尾巴则是金银制成的。它的脖子上系着一条丝带，上面写着一张纸条。“一只来自日本天皇的夜莺——虽然比不上你的夜莺，”纸条上写道。

When the clockwork bird was wound up, it moved its tail up and down and sang out loud. ‘Ahhh! Such an enchanting sound!’ sighed the Emperor. ‘Bring me the real nightingale so they can sing together – what a duet that will be!’

- wind /wɪnd/ vt. 缠绕；上发条；使弯曲；winded or wound wound /waʊnd/
- enchant 英 /ɪnˈtʃɑːnt/  美 /ɪnˈtʃænt/ v. 使着迷，使迷惑；施魔法于
- duet /djuˈet/ n. 二重奏；二重唱

发条鸟上紧发条后，它的尾巴上下摆动，大声唱歌。“啊!多么迷人的声音!皇帝叹了口气。“把那只真正的夜莺给我带来，让他们一起唱歌——那将是多么美妙的二重唱啊!”

But the two birds didn’t sound as good together as the Emperor had hoped. The clockwork nightingale’s song was mechanical and rather harsh compared to the natural beauty of the real bird’s song…

- mechanical /məˈkænɪkl/ adj. 机械的；
- harsh /hɑːʃ/ adj. 严厉的；严酷的；**刺耳的**；粗糙的；刺目的；丑陋的

但是这两只鸟在一起的声音并没有皇帝希望的那么好听。发条似的夜莺的歌声是机械的，与真正的鸟叫声的自然美相比，显得有些刺耳……

The clockwork bird had just one, rather complicated tune that it sang over and over – thirty three times to be exact - before it needed winding up again. But the Emperor’s Music Master was full of praise.

- complicated /ˈkɒmplɪkeɪtɪd/ adj. 难懂的，复杂的
- tune /tjuːn/ n. 曲调；和谐；心情
- exact /ɪɡˈzækt/ adj. 准确的，精密的；精确的
- Master /ˈmɑːstə(r)/ n. 主人；大师；硕士；男教师；原件；院长；

这只发条鸟只有一个相当复杂的曲调，它唱了一遍又一遍——准确地说是三十三遍——然后才需要再次上弦。但是皇帝的音乐老师却赞不绝口。

‘It sounds perfect to me, your Imperial Majesty!’ he announced. ‘And with all it’s little cogs and wheels, it’s perfect on the inside too. In fact, it’s so perfect it should sing all by itself. You never know what a real nightingale is going to sing, but with this bird there will be no unexpected surprises. You get the same tune every time!’

- [your grace](https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/396255034502395645.html)
- Imperial /ɪmˈpɪəriəl/ adj. 帝国的；皇帝的；至高无上的；威严的
- Majesty /ˈmædʒəsti/ n. 威严；最高权威，王权；雄伟；权威
- cog /kɒɡ/ n. 齿轮，轮齿；

“听起来很完美，陛下!”他宣布。“所有的小齿轮和轮子，它的内部也是完美的。事实上，它是如此完美，它应该独自歌唱。你永远不知道一只真正的夜莺会唱什么，但是有了这只夜莺，就不会有任何意外的惊喜了。你每次都听到同样的调子!”

‘Maybe you are right,’ said the Emperor. ‘Besides, it’s so much prettier and more sparkly to look at than that small grey bird. Oh – where’s it gone?’ No-one had noticed the nightingale fly out of the open window, back to the green forest.

- sparkly /'spɑ:kli/ adj. 耀眼的

“也许你是对的，”皇帝说。“而且，它比那只灰色的小鸟漂亮得多，也更闪闪发光。哦，它去哪儿了?没有人注意到夜莺从敞开的窗户飞出，飞回了绿色的森林。

‘What strange behaviour,’ said the Emperor. ‘The ungrateful creature’ added the Lord-in-Waiting. ‘That nightingale is banished from my empire, never to return!’ announced the Emperor grandly. ‘No matter, for we have the best bird of all right here. Let’s listen to it again!’

- ungrateful /ʌnˈɡreɪtfl/ adj. 忘恩负义的；不领情的；讨厌的；徒劳的
- banish /ˈbænɪʃ/ vt. 放逐；驱逐

“多么奇怪的行为!”皇帝说。“这个忘恩负义的家伙。”侍从补充道。“那只夜莺被驱逐出我的帝国，永远不会回来了!”皇帝庄严地宣布。“没关系，因为我们这儿有最好的鸟。让我们再听一遍!”

The next day, the Music Master paraded the clockwork nightingale before a great crowd that had been summoned to hear it sing. Everyone was very impressed – all that is except the poor fisherman. ‘It sounds pretty enough,’ he thought, ‘and the tune is quite similar. But something’s not quite right…’

- parade /pəˈreɪd/ n. 游行；阅兵；炫耀；行进；阅兵场 vt. 游行；炫耀；列队行进 vi. 游行；炫耀；列队行进
- summon /ˈsʌmən/ vt. 召唤；召集；鼓起；振作

第二天，音乐大师带着这只钟形夜莺在一大群前来听它唱歌的人面前列队游行。除了可怜的渔夫，所有的人都对此印象深刻。“听起来很好听，”他想，“调子也很相似。但有些地方不大对劲……”

The clockwork bird was placed on a silk cushion by the Emperor’s bed and surrounded by gifts of gold and precious stones. Meanwhile, the Music Master wrote a long book full of difficult Chinese words about the wonderful new bird which everyone was made to read it. Before long, they had heard the song so many times they all knew it by heart. ‘La la la, zing zing, whirrrr!’ – even the Emperor sang along.

- cushion /ˈkʊʃn/ n. 垫子；起缓解作用之物；（猪等的）臀肉；银行储蓄 vt. 给…安上垫子；把…安置在垫子上；缓和…的冲击
- Before long 不久以后

这只发条鸟被放在皇帝床前的一个丝绸垫子上，周围是黄金和宝石的礼物。与此同时，这位音乐大师写了一本很长的书，书中满是关于这只奇妙的新鸟的难懂的中文单词，每个人都被要求阅读它。不久，他们听过这首歌很多次了，他们都把它记在心里了。“啦啦啦，吱、吱、呼!”——连皇帝也跟着唱了起来。

But one evening, as he lay in bed listening to the mechanical tune yet again, a harsh noise suddenly interrupted the melody. It sounded like the little wheels and cogs inside the clockwork bird were going wild! Oh dear. Something definitely wasn’t right…

- harsh /hɑːʃ/ adj. 严厉的；严酷的；**刺耳的**；粗糙的；刺目的；丑陋的
- melody /ˈmelədi/ n. 旋律；歌曲；美妙的音乐
- wild /waɪld/ adj. 野生的；野蛮的；狂热的；荒凉的 n. 荒野 adv. 疯狂地；胡乱地
- definitely /ˈdefɪnətli/ adv. 清楚地，当然；明确地，肯定地

但是一天晚上，当他躺在床上再次听着那支机械的曲子时，一种刺耳的声音突然打断了这支曲子。听起来好像发条鸟的小轮子和齿轮都要发疯了!哦亲爱的。肯定有什么地方不对劲……

As the singing stopped, the Emperor sprang out of bed. ‘Watchmaker!!’ he cried. ‘My clockwork nightingale has broken and I need you to fix her at once!’ The watchmaker took the metal bird apart and poked and prodded around inside.

- poke /pəʊk/ v. 刺，捅；戳；拨开
- prod /prɒd/ v. 刺，戳；刺激，督促

当歌声停止时，皇帝从床上跳了起来。“钟表匠! !”他哭了。“我的发条夜莺坏了，我需要你马上去修她!”钟表匠把金属鸟拆开，在里面又拨又戳。

‘It’s sung so much that it’s getting worn out, I’m afraid,’ he sighed. ‘If it gets more damaged, the tune may never play again.’

- wear /weə(r)/ v. 穿，戴；过去式 wore; 过去分词 worn
- wear out 磨损，耗尽；穿破；使精疲力竭

"恐怕是唱得太多了，都快磨坏了，"他叹了口气。如果它受到更大的损害，这首曲子可能就再也放不出来了。

It was a terrible upset. Although the Music Master pretended to everyone that the bird was fine, from now on, it was only allowed to sing once a year – and even that was risky.Five years passed and a great sadness slowly fell over China. The people were very fond of their Emperor – but by now he was very ill. So ill that a new Emperor had been chosen to be crowned when he died.

- upset /ʌpˈset/ vt. 使心烦；颠覆；扰乱 vi. 翻倒 adj. 心烦的；混乱的；弄翻的 n. **混乱**；翻倒；颠覆
- fall 过去式 fell过去分词 fallen

这是一个可怕的不安。尽管音乐大师假装这只鸟很好，但从现在开始，它每年只能唱歌一次，即使这样做也是有风险的。五年过去了，巨大的悲伤慢慢笼罩着中国。人们都很喜欢他们的皇帝，但是现在他病得很厉害。他病得很重，以至于在他死后，人们选了一个新的皇帝来加冕。

The Emperor lay in his royal bed. He was so cold and pale that everyone thought he was dead. All was silent and still in the empty room. A window stood open and the moon shone down upon his still body and the clockwork bird by his side.

- royal /ˈrɔɪəl/ adj. 皇家的；盛大的；女王的；高贵的；第一流的 n. 王室；王室成员

皇帝躺在他的龙床上。他又冷又苍白，大家都以为他死了。空荡荡的房间里一片寂静。一扇窗户开着，月亮照在他安静的身体上，发条鸟在他身边。

Suddenly, the Emperor called out. ‘Music!’ he cried faintly. ‘Sing, my precious little golden bird! I have given you precious gifts. I have even hung my golden slipper round your neck. Sing! Sing!!’

- faintly /ˈfeɪntli/ adv. 微弱地；模糊地；虚弱地

突然，皇帝叫了起来。“音乐!他有气无力地叫道。“唱吧，我可爱的金色小鸟!”我已经给了你珍贵的礼物。我甚至把我的金拖鞋挂在你的脖子上了。唱歌!唱歌! !”

But the bird stayed silent. Because there was no one to wind it up, it couldn’t sing a note. Suddenly the sound of sweet music came through the open window. Outside, on the bough of a tree, sat the nightingale. ‘I heard you were ill,’ she said, ‘so I have come to sing to you – and bring you hope.’

- note n. 笔记；**音符**；票据；注解；纸币；便笺；照会；调子 vt. 注意；记录；注解
- bough /baʊ/ n. 大树枝

但是鸟保持沉默。因为没有人给它上弦，它唱不出一个音符。突然，甜美的音乐声从敞开的窗户里传出来。外面，在一根大树枝上，坐着一只夜莺。“我听说你病了，”她说，“所以我来唱歌给你听——给你带来希望。”

As she carried on singing, the shadows grew paler and paler. The Emperor moved his arms and legs a little. He was starting to feel a bit better.

当她继续唱歌时，影子变得越来越白。皇帝移动了一下他的胳膊和腿。他开始感觉好一点了。

Meanwhile, the nightingale carried on singing. She sang of white roses, fresh sweet grass and the perfume of the trees that blew on the breeze…

- perfume /ˈpɜːfjuːm/ n. 香水；香味 vt. 洒香水于…；使…带香味 vi. 散发香气
- blow v.（风）吹；过去式 blew过去分词 blown
- breeze /briːz/ n. 微风

与此同时，夜莺继续歌唱。她唱着白玫瑰、新鲜的甜草和微风吹过的树的芳香……

The Emperor gently opened his eyes. ‘Thank you, little bird,’ he sighed. ‘I banished you from my empire, yet you have banished death from my heart with your sweet song. How can I reward you?’

- banish /ˈbænɪʃ/ vt. 放逐；驱逐

皇帝轻轻地睁开了眼睛。“谢谢你，小鸟，”他叹息道。“我把你驱逐出我的王国，而你却用你美妙的歌声把死亡从我心里驱逐出去。我怎么报答你呢?”

‘You have already rewarded me,’ said the nightingale. ‘I shall never forget the tears in your eyes the first time I sang to you. That is a powerful gift – the greatest of them all. But sleep now and grow strong and well. I will sing to you again.’

“你已经报答我了，”夜莺说。“我永远不会忘记我第一次唱给你听时你眼里的泪水。这是一份强大的礼物——是所有礼物中最伟大的。现在就睡吧，好好地长身体。我再唱给你听。”

As she sang, the Emperor fell into a sweet sleep. When he woke up, the sun was shining and he felt strong and alert. But not one of his servants was by his side. They still thought he was dead.

当她唱歌时，皇帝进入了甜蜜的睡眠。当他醒来时，阳光灿烂，他感到强壮和警觉。但没有一个仆人在他身边。他们仍然认为他已经死了。

‘Please, stay with me always,’ the Emperor pleaded to the nightingale. ‘You need sing only when you want to. Meanwhile I shall break that clockwork bird into a thousand pieces’.

- plead /pliːd/ vt. 借口；为...辩护；托称 vi. **恳求**；辩护

“请永远和我在一起，”皇帝请求夜莺。“你只有在想唱的时候才需要唱。与此同时，我要把那只发条鸟撕成碎片。

‘No, don’t do that,’ replied the nightingale. ‘It kept going for as long as it could. Keep it here. I can’t live in the palace and build my nest, but in the evening I will sit on the bough by your window and sing to you…

“不，不要那样做，”夜莺回答。它尽可能长时间地持续着。保持它在这里。我不能住在宫殿里，也不能筑巢，但晚上我会坐在你窗边的树枝上，为你歌唱……

I’ll make you feel happy - but I will also make you feel thoughtful. I shall tell you about the lives of the people in your empire you never meet – like the poor fisherman and the little kitchen maid. I shall tell you about people who are happy and those who feel sad too.

我会让你感到快乐——但我也会让你感到深思。我将告诉你你从未见过的帝国人民的生活——比如可怜的渔夫和小厨房女佣。我将告诉你那些快乐的人和那些感到悲伤的人。

But you must promise me one thing.’ ‘Everything!’ said the Emperor. ‘No – just this one thing,’ repeated the nightingale. ‘Don’t let anyone know you have a little bird who tells you everything. Let’s keep it our secret’.

但你必须答应我一件事。“一切!”皇帝说。“不——只有一件事，”夜莺重复道。“不要让任何人知道你有一只小鸟，它会告诉你一切。让我们保守秘密吧。”

And with that, the nightingale flew away. When the servants finally arrived to carry their dead Emperor away, they were astonished to see him standing in his fine velvet gown. The colour had returned to his cheeks and he looked fit and healthy.

- velvet /ˈvelvɪt/ n. 天鹅绒，丝绒；天鹅绒似的东西 adj. 天鹅绒的
- gown /ɡaʊn/ n. **长袍，长外衣**；礼服；睡袍；法衣 vt. 使穿睡衣

说着，夜莺飞走了。当仆人们终于来把死去的皇帝抬走的时候，他们惊奇地看到他穿着华丽的天鹅绒长袍。他的面颊恢复了血色，看上去很健康。

‘Good heavens!’ they cried in surprise.

“天啊!他们惊讶地叫道。

‘Good morning!’ he answered with a happy smile.

“早上好!”他笑着回答。

The Emperor of China has a wonderful porcelain palace and a garden that goes on for miles. The garden leads to a great forest, in which a nightingale lives. The nightingale sings so beautifully that visiting travellers are moved to write about her song.

- porcelain /ˈpɔːrsəlɪn/ n. 瓷；瓷器 adj. 瓷制的；精美的
- palace /ˈpæləs/ n. 宫殿；宅邸；豪华住宅

中国的皇帝有一座漂亮的瓷器宫殿和一座绵延数英里的花园。花园通向一片大森林，森林里住着一只夜莺。夜莺歌唱得如此美妙，以至于来访的游客都被她的歌声感动了。

One day the emperor reads one of these written accounts and is surprised, for he has not heard the nightingale himself. He orders that the nightingale is brought to him, and a kitchen maid leads the Emperor's servants to where the bird can be found. They are surprised that the bird is so small and grey, but when she sings for the Emperor he is moved to tears. The nightingale is to live in a cage at the palace so that the Emperor can continue hearing her song.

有一天，皇帝读了其中的一篇文章，感到很惊讶，因为他自己也没有听到夜莺的歌声。他命令把夜莺带给他，一个厨房女仆带着皇帝的仆人去找夜莺。他们很惊讶这只鸟是如此的小和灰色，但当她为皇帝唱歌时，他感动得流下了眼泪。这只夜莺将被关在皇宫的笼子里，这样皇帝就可以继续听到她的歌声。

One day the Emperor receives a clockwork, jewelled nightingale as a gift. It also sings well, but only one rather mechanical tune. The real nightingale escapes and flies back to the wood. The Emperor thinks this does not matter now that he has the mechanical nightingale, but he listens to it so much that it breaks down and can only be played once a year.

- jewelled /ˈdʒuːəld/ adj. 镶有宝石的；带首饰的

有一天，皇帝收到了一个钟表，镶嵌着珠宝的夜莺作为礼物。它也唱得很好，但只是一个相当机械的曲调。真正的夜莺逃走了，飞回了树林。皇帝认为这已经不重要了，因为他现在有了机械夜莺，但是他听它听得太多了，它坏了，一年只能演奏一次。

Soon the Emperor falls ill and is dying. He calls out for music, but there is nobody to wind the clockwork nightingale. The real nightingale returns to the trees outside and her song revives the Emperor. She sings to him about the people in the empire that he never meets and so he becomes a more informed and better Emperor.

- revive /rɪˈvaɪv/ vi. 复兴；复活；苏醒；恢复精神 vt. 使复兴；**使苏醒**；回想起；重演，重播
- informed /ɪnˈfɔːmd/ adj. **见多识广的**；消息灵通的；有根据的；明智的（猜测或决定） v. 通知；使了解；提供资料（inform的过去式和过去分词）

不久皇帝病倒了，生命垂危。他大声叫着要音乐，可是没有人给夜莺上发条。真正的夜莺回到外面的树林里，她的歌声唤醒了皇帝。她给他唱关于他从未见过的帝国人民的歌，因此他成为了一个更有见识、更好的皇帝。
