## Winter

- Fluffing the Cotton
- Removing Seeds of the Cotton
- Storing the Cotton

Grandma observes that winter in rural areas is far colder than that in the city. She promises Yaya she'll make her a new, and maximally windproof coat after the coming autumn cotton harvest. This makes Yaya hope for an early winter this year because she can't wait to try on her new coat.

**Canvas**

The snowfield is a vast canvas painted in footprints. Gazing at the canvas, Yaya wonders who "painted" secretly /ˈsiːkrətli/ last night.

**Beginning of Winter**

The temperature is falling, the trees are bare, and small wild animals are rarely seen in the fields at this time. Perhaps some are already hibernating. Dad says that for some poikilothermal animals like snakes and frogs in particular, sleeping through the harsh winter months is the surest way of survival.

Yaya observes that humans spend most of their time in winter at home, so isn't that like hibernation?

The Beginning of Winter falls on November 7 or 8. The Chinese character for "Winter" also means making an end, or finishing, which signifies the storing of harvested crops that have been laid out in the sun to dry for a few days before winter's approach. It's when small wild animals retreat to their nests and burrows to hibernate. Although humans don't hibernate at the Beginning of Winter, Chinese people do make a point of eating the invigorating, fortifying foods that help to withstand winter's frigid rigors.

If the weather at the Beginning of Winter is sunny, there will be a chill winter; if the weather at the Beginning of Winter is cloudy, there will be a warm winter.

The Sun reaches ecliptic longitude 225o

Record the thermometer reading on this day.

- Highest temperature _____ oC
- Lowest temperature ______ oC

**Snow and Rainfall**

Precipitation drops dramatically in most regions across China around the Beginning of Winter, diversifying from rain, to sleet, snow, and hail. Frigid temperatures take hold, but may also unexpectedly rise. With more pollutants accumulating in the atmosphere, it forms heavy fog or haze easily.

**Three Hou of the Beginning of Winter**

- During the first hou, the water starts to freeze.
- During the second hou, the ground starts to freeze.
- During the third hou, the pheasants dive in the river to morph into clams.

**Water Starts to Freeze**

When the temperature drops, land in the North begins to freeze and harden, and thin ice forms on rivers and lakes. In the south, it's the season for autumn harvesting and winter sowing, when everyone takes the chance to rush-plant winter wheat.

**Hibernation**

For some small wild animals, hibernation is the surest way to survive winter's frigid rigors and scarce food. The body temperature of poikilotherms, such as snakes and frogs, drops in tandem with the outside temperature, immobilizing them into a state of torpor. Certain endotherms, for example, hedgehogs, also hibernate. They curl up in a warm hole or burrow and sleep the winter out, reaching s state where they can survive on no food and a very low rate of respiration.

What animals do you know that hibernate?

- poikilotherm /'pɒɪkɪlə(ʊ),θɜːm/ n. 变温动物
- endotherm /'ɛndə,θɚm/ n. 恒温动物

**Orchids Bloom**

The orchid, Chinese plum flower, bamboo, and chrysanthemum are traditionally known as the "four Gentlemen" of the garden. Orchids need shade, so they often grow in valleys. With glossy, slender leaves and elegant, subtly tinted petals emitting a light fragrance, they evoke the persona of o modest gentleman. The many orchid varieties include the cymbidium kanrans, which bloom around the Beginning of Winter, and whose fragrance gets stronger with the declining temperature. To Chinese ancients, orchids embodied aesthetic perfection, and were also associated with the joy of deep friendship.

- glossy /ˈɡlɑːsi/ adj. 光滑的；有光泽的
- cymbidium /sɪm'bɪdɪəm/ n. 兰花
- kanrans



The snow-shrouded ground basks in the winter sunshine, like a huge cotton-padded quilt, a corner of which the warm sunshine lifts to reveal the budding green winter wheat.
冰雪覆盖的地面，在冬日的阳光下，就像一床巨大的棉被，暖暖的阳光托起一角，露出嫩绿的冬小麦。

### Arrival of the New Year

Everyone who has worked hard the past year embraces the arrival of the New Year with faces wreathed in smiles.
