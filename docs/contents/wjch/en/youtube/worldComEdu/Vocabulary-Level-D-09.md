[Music]
hello everybody
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
i'm your host brian stewart
we're going over the same topic we're
talking about caring for animals
but in this lesson lesson nine we're
going to
focus on who helps sick or
injured pets the title of course is a
healthy pet
is a happy pet so if your pet is not
healthy
what happens who helps that pet who
helps a sick
or injured pet well that's what we're
going to read about
in today's lesson but as usual let's
learn some vocabulary first now our
first word is uh
oh here we have a problem right
hurt having a cut or other injury this
poor baseball player
looks to be injured right maybe they got
hit by the ball
or they twisted their leg or something
happened or another player
ran into that person so what do we call
a person
who becomes injured
while playing or working or doing
whatever right
you could be walking to school and you
can become injured right
so if you hurt yourself or you get hurt
somebody else hurts you
and you have a cut or you have a bruise
there are many types of
injuries right many types of injuries
but you are injured part of your body is
damaged
that means injured now be careful
because injured doesn't mean the same as
sick
if you're sick that means you have a
virus
or some kind of disease right that's
affecting your body
and you don't feel right if you're
injured there's been some kind of
physical
damage to your body okay so injury
and sickness are different remember that
okay
and that's how in the title we had to
say who helps sick
or injured animals because they're
different
a sick animal is not the same as an
injured animal
it's a different type of problem when
you're sick it's a different problem
than if you're injured okay so those are
two different
conditions okay next one
a medicine that help that keeps you from
getting sick
now right it's terrible and probably you
were in this situation before
but it's very important that you go to
the doctor and the doctor gives you
medicine usually a shot
right that helps you from becoming sick
later everybody has it right now we call
these things a vaccine
it's a it's a medicine that you get when
you're young
to prevent you from getting sick later
some people still have the bump on their
arm
from where they got a shot when they
were young usually it's for smallpox
or some other disease like that like
polio
and this is a vaccine of course we live
in a very
convenient age the modern age that we
live in
is very convenient we don't think about
it but medicine has developed so we can
take these vaccines when we're young
we don't have to worry about these
diseases a hundred years ago
200 years ago people died
by the thousands by the millions from
diseases that we don't worry about today
because of vaccines
so yes it hurts but it's important to
get
a vaccine people will say shot have you
gotten your
shots yet or i need to get a shot so to
get a shot
get a
shot because it's like a shot
that you get in your arm and that's
usually a vaccine
for something that will prevent you from
getting sick
nowadays we hear a lot about the flu
shot the flu shot
it's a vaccine to prevent you from
getting the flu and people will take it
every year before winter starts to
protect them from
the flu okay next one three
sharing equally with others so these two
artists or producers or i'm not sure
what's going on here
they're sharing their award equally what
they have that
award what do they have they have it in
common
if you have something in common with
somebody that means you share that
condition or that attribute right if
you and your mother are very similar
in appearance right your appearance you
share
your appearance in common if you and
your father have the same
sense of humor right you share that same
sense of humor
then you have a sense of humor in common
it means you have something similar to
somebody else
okay next one number four whoa that's
kind of a funny looking picture right
here's a little boy and he's meeting his
younger brother or sister but not yet
his younger brother or sister is still
in his mommy's
belly right having a baby growing inside
one
so mom here what can we say about mom
she has a baby
inside of her womb inside of her belly
right
it's she is pregnant so she is
pregnant sometimes people say she's with
child but she is pregnant okay
next one difficult something that is
very difficult to do
like climb uh the rocks without a shirt
on
that's that's tough okay i'm just
kidding about without the shirt on
it's it's tough even with a shirt on but
it's difficult
it's tough right so they're synonyms
basically if you say something is very
difficult you can say oh it's very
tough right for example if you have a
difficult
test you can say whoa that test was very
tough it was a tough test it was a
difficult test
right it was tough or it was difficult
next one
when a doctor cuts you open
and fixes you that's what's going on
here and this is
this is something that's extreme right
oh thankfully it's not very
common but sometimes some people maybe
us
maybe you maybe me might have a
situation
where the doctor needs to cut actually
cut open our body
and fix something inside to help
cure us what do we call that procedure
we say it is surgery okay
now the verb that we usually use with
surgery is
perform the doctor will perform
surgery uh or i need to
another way that we call this is
operation
an operation
i need to have
an operation so if i say if i'm in the
hospital and i say
i have to have an operation that means
the doctor will perform
surgery on me right the doctor performs
surgery on me i need to have
an operation those are the common ways
that we talk about this situation
also surgery can be used as an adjective
for example
the surgery room uh this is the
surgery preparation room or this is the
surgery
area of the hospital so sometimes
surgery can also be an adjective
not just a noun okay but remember when
it is a noun
we usually use say perform surgery and
we
also say i need to have an operation or
you need an operation that's the same
idea
okay so a couple of common expressions
for that situation
next one a visit to the doctor to check
your health now you should do this every
year some people go every six months
right maybe when they're younger it's
important to do that but you need to
regularly go to the doctor to check
your health and that's part of the word
right
check up because the doctor needs to
check
on you you need to check to make sure
you're not sick
it's called a checkup and usually people
go once a year for their annual
checkup okay number eight
a person who treats people for
sicknesses and injuries
when you go to the doctor to check for
sicknesses or if you have an injury
who do you go to what do you call that
person i think i just said it doctor
right this person this lady
she is a doctor right and there are many
different types of doctors right
some doctors will only specialize in
like the nose
the throat and the ears some doctors
will only specialize in treating
children some doctors will only
specialize
in fixing broken bones right there are
many different types of doctors
okay number nine happening at the same
time
every time so this is like uh uh
something that happens every time if you
wind this up this is
what musicians usually use right it goes
tick tick tick tick
every time at a certain time what do we
say
it's regular it's regular clocks
are regular they show us the time
all the time every time right and one
hour they go around the clock
regularly or clocks are very regular we
can depend on them
sometimes we have habits that are
regular for example every morning you
get up
you take a shower you brush your teeth
or eat breakfast then you brush your
teeth
that's your regular morning routine
that's regular
if you do something different that's
unusual right that would be the opposite
but happening at the same time every
time that's
regular okay next one
right we have a couple of cows here a
baby cow right
animals will have different names for
different sexes right male or female
they'll also have different names
for their age right we we don't really
say
we can't say baby cow but you could also
say
calf calf is more specific right
a baby horse you could say it's a baby
horse
or you could say it's a cult
right you could say a baby dog or you
can say
puppy right isn't it interesting in
english i don't know if it's the same in
korean but
in english we have all these special
words for baby
animals they're usually a lot different
right
there's also cub right for bears
and lions and tigers have cubs dogs have
puppies horses have colts cows have
calves oh so many words to remember
okay but it's very interesting okay next
one
oh what's wrong with him he had a bad
haircut
right he should sue his barber no i'm
just kidding
he wanted it that way obviously you have
to you have to
specifically ask for this type of
haircut okay
strange and unusual i'm making a comment
about it because it's not normal to see
somebody
with a haircut like this it is yeah you
could say
weird okay be strange she's unusual
you could also say unique
now it's interesting because if we say
weird weird has a little bit of a
negative
feeling to it you say it's weird it's
like oh that's weird
but if you say it's unique that can have
a little bit of a positive feeling about
it
so it depends on how you look at the
situation
if you look at him and says wow that's
cool he's unique
or you can look at him and say oh that's
not good it's
weird okay so be careful using weird
because weird usually means you have a
negative feeling
about something or unique can be
if you have a positive feeling about
something but it's strange it's unusual
then say oh that's unique okay so that's
more polite or better feeling associated
with unique
then weird okay so that's interesting
about these words here
next a container for carrying something
this is a container for carrying
something if you have to carry your pet
for example you will carry your pet in a
carrier
usually we only use this word though
it's usually
used for transporting animals a carrier
if you have a container for carrying
your books
you don't call it a carrier you call it
a backpack if you have a container for
carrying your food
to a school or to your office we don't
really call it a carrier you could but
it's a little strange
we just say it's a food container or if
you use the brand name it's tupperware
right so we carrier is usually
specifically used for
a container that carries animals for
transportation
next one number 13 a place where animals
are raised for food
now a lot of people they don't know
where their food comes from they think
oh
food comes from the supermarket but
that's not true
where does the supermarket get the food
the supermarket is not the original
place
where the food comes from the food comes
from animals
a lot of animals and also plants uh
where the animals are raised for food
like for example pork
or uh beef sogogy right if you want to
have
uh sorry i
bulgogi i had a hard time just
remembering that
bulgogi or duiji kalbi right that
meat comes from where it comes from a
farm
okay we say it's a farm where animals
are raised
for food okay sometimes people will also
call it
a ranch but a ranch has a little bit of
a different idea
a ranch is much bigger than a farm and a
ranch is usually where
you have a lot of cows or
cattle that's usually where cattle is
is raised and it's usually very big
farms tend to be small
and farms are also places where they
grow plants
like corn wheat things like that
but our ranch is where usually
specifically for
cows we have very big groups herds
of of cattle okay so anyway farm
and ranch usually we talk about farm a
place where animals are raised for food
okay next one now she looks like she's
doing yoga
right and she's stretching her body so
that her hands are pointing where
they're facing away from the front front
her fingers are
pointing away from her front they are
pointing
backward okay now if you turn around
right right now i'm i'm looking at you
i'm looking at you in the front
but i can turn this way now i'm looking
backward okay
it just means facing away from the front
looking backward or
stretching backward okay
next one a doctor who cares for animals
now there's a very long word
veterinarian we'll see that word later
in the reading
veterinarian but that's a hinduroa word
to pronounce
so a lot of people just say that so
veterinarian
just say vet because it's a lot easier
and most people just say
vet a vet is a doctor who cares for
animals
but be careful because vet
sometimes also can mean something else
that is completely
different a veteran a veteran
is a soldier who served in
a war or served for their country in the
military
sometimes people will call those people
a vet too
he's a vet he served in the iraq war
they're not talking about a person who
cares for animals okay
so be careful that can mean a former
ex-soldier right a person who used to be
a soldier
or it can be a doctor who cares for
animals so be careful don't be confused
if somebody says vet you have to know
the situation
what is the context of the situation
okay last word
kenjiro
a hard cover that goes over a part of
your body now unfortunately this girl
she
doesn't seem to be upset about it but
she's been injured right
she probably broke or sprained
her ankle or her foot so she has to
put something on that part of her body
to keep
the bones from moving you want to keep
the bones in the same position so they
can heal
together now when i first came to korea
it was konglish people called it gips
right gips but that's konglish the word
is
cast now i was very confused i was like
why do my students call this a gips
where does that come from well i learned
that this is made
of the same material that chalk white
chalk in your classroom is made of
and that's gypsum ah very interesting
so gibs comes from the material
that the caste is made from right and so
i don't know
where that started whether it comes from
japan or or you know
a lot of congress comes from japan i
don't know where that came from
but some somewhere people were thinking
okay well the cast is made of gypsum
so they just thought gipps and they
called it that well that's congress
americans don't have any idea about that
it confused me
when i first heard it i'm like where
does that come from we normally just say
cast right and you put a cast on it or
you
wear a cast just like a shoe
or a shirt you wear a cast wear a cast
okay or you could say the doctor put a
cast
on my foot now even though you wear it
it's not like a shoe
you can't take it off and put it back on
right
the doctor puts it on and then six weeks
later the doctor has to cut
it off right so it's not normal piece of
clothing but we use the same verb
wear a cast i have to wear a cast for
six
months and don't say this that's
konglish
okay let's review how well do we
remember these words
uh let's go over the uh comprehension
questions here
just the same as usual we have a blank
we need to choose the best word
to fill in the blank number one smallpox
i talked about that before smallpox was
a disease
a hundred years ago 200 years ago
terrible disease killed many many people
it was a sickness that is gone now
thanks to people getting what remember i
told you
when you're young it's important to get
that medicine to get a shot
what's in the shot is it a checkup is it
a vaccine
is it an injury or is it a doctor well
of course it's not a doctor you can't
put a person inside that shot that's
crazy
it's not an injury that doesn't make
sense it's not a checkup
it's of course a vaccine right
thanks to people getting the vaccine
smallpox is gone
nobody ever gets smallpox anymore
because
medicine has advanced so much that we
just get the
vaccine and the disease has died out in
human beings it's not there anymore
okay number two the pilot was beep badly
when his plane crashed
think about that somebody's flying a
plane and they don't land correctly the
plane crashes
well what's going to happen the pilot
was what celebrated
injured pregnant or treated you can't
get pregnant from crashing your plane
that's crazy okay
you're probably not going to be
celebrated with celebrated badly that
doesn't make any sense celebrated is a
good thing
uh treated he was treated badly when his
plane crashed that's possible actually
right
people said oh you shouldn't have
crashed a plane but more logically
he was injured badly that makes more
sense because of course when you think
about it
if you crash a plane or even if you
crash a car
or even your bicycle you crash you could
get
badly injured so be careful when you're
in a vehicle
or riding your bike you can become
injured
badly when your vehicle crashes whether
it's a plane it's a car
or a bike be careful and follow the
safety
rules and regulations okay number five
skipping up to number five
i get along well with my girlfriend do
you have a girlfriend or boyfriend
okay do you get along well with that
person
we have a lot what if you get along with
your girlfriend it doesn't have to be
girlfriend it could just be friend
you get along well with your friend
because we have a lot of what of
problems
we have a lot of boredom we have a lot
to forget
or we have a lot in common what makes
sense
if you have a lot of problems with your
girlfriend you don't get along well
maybe it's time to break up and
and go find somebody else who you don't
have problems with
uh we have a lot of boredom that doesn't
make sense right
that does you get along with somebody
because you're both bored together
that's ysung hail
we have a lot to forget strange too we
have a lot in common
ah remember in common means you share
something with somebody else so if you
share something with somebody else
you can understand them better so if you
have a lot
and we say a lot in common that's a
common expression
we have a lot in common then
you get along with the other person if
you don't get along with somebody
you can say we have nothing in common
that's the pandiro that's the opposite
right so if you meet somebody
you think they could be my friend but
they're very different from you
they don't like the same things that you
do they don't like the same movies or
the same
music they don't like the same books
they don't like the same hobbies that
you do
you're not going to be able to spend a
lot of time with them
because you don't like the things they
do you don't have
anything in common you have nothing in
common
but on the other situation if you have
many things in common
you have a lot in common you like the
same books you like the same hobbies
you like the same movies then you can
get along with that person well
okay number seven i can't believe you're
beep and you're going to have twins have
twins that means that somebody is going
to have babies now remember what we
talked about what's that word
if somebody has a baby in their belly
what are they are they necessary are
they small
are they slow or are they pregnant well
of course the only one that makes sense
is pregnant i can't believe you're
pregnant and you're gonna have twins
not just one baby but two babies right
at the same time
you're going to have twins necessary
doesn't make sense i can't believe
you're small
what does that mean how does that have
to do with twins
and i can't believe your slow is kind of
funny too the only one that makes sense
is
pregnant okay well let's take a break
now and we'll come back
and go over the reading together

hello everybody
00:10
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
00:12
i'm your host brian stewart
00:14
we're going over the same topic we're
00:16
talking about caring for animals
00:18
but in this lesson lesson nine we're
00:21
going to
00:22
focus on who helps sick or
00:25
injured pets the title of course is a
00:28
healthy pet
00:29
is a happy pet so if your pet is not
00:32
healthy
00:34
what happens who helps that pet who
00:36
helps a sick
00:37
or injured pet well that's what we're
00:39
going to read about
00:40
in today's lesson but as usual let's
00:44
learn some vocabulary first now our
00:46
first word is uh
00:47
oh here we have a problem right
00:50
hurt having a cut or other injury this
00:53
poor baseball player
00:55
looks to be injured right maybe they got
00:57
hit by the ball
00:59
or they twisted their leg or something
01:01
happened or another player
01:02
ran into that person so what do we call
01:06
a person
01:06
who becomes injured
01:11
while playing or working or doing
01:13
whatever right
01:14
you could be walking to school and you
01:16
can become injured right
01:18
so if you hurt yourself or you get hurt
01:21
somebody else hurts you
01:22
and you have a cut or you have a bruise
01:25
there are many types of
01:27
injuries right many types of injuries
01:31
but you are injured part of your body is
01:34
damaged
01:35
that means injured now be careful
01:37
because injured doesn't mean the same as
01:39
sick
01:40
if you're sick that means you have a
01:42
virus
01:43
or some kind of disease right that's
01:46
affecting your body
01:47
and you don't feel right if you're
01:49
injured there's been some kind of
01:51
physical
01:51
damage to your body okay so injury
01:55
and sickness are different remember that
01:58
okay
01:58
and that's how in the title we had to
02:00
say who helps sick
02:02
or injured animals because they're
02:05
different
02:06
a sick animal is not the same as an
02:08
injured animal
02:09
it's a different type of problem when
02:11
you're sick it's a different problem
02:13
than if you're injured okay so those are
02:16
two different
02:17
conditions okay next one
02:20
a medicine that help that keeps you from
02:22
getting sick
02:23
now right it's terrible and probably you
02:27
were in this situation before
02:28
but it's very important that you go to
02:30
the doctor and the doctor gives you
02:32
medicine usually a shot
02:33
right that helps you from becoming sick
02:38
later everybody has it right now we call
02:41
these things a vaccine
02:43
it's a it's a medicine that you get when
02:46
you're young
02:47
to prevent you from getting sick later
02:50
some people still have the bump on their
02:51
arm
02:52
from where they got a shot when they
02:54
were young usually it's for smallpox
02:57
or some other disease like that like
02:59
polio
03:01
and this is a vaccine of course we live
03:03
in a very
03:05
convenient age the modern age that we
03:08
live in
03:09
is very convenient we don't think about
03:10
it but medicine has developed so we can
03:13
take these vaccines when we're young
03:15
we don't have to worry about these
03:17
diseases a hundred years ago
03:20
200 years ago people died
03:23
by the thousands by the millions from
03:26
diseases that we don't worry about today
03:29
because of vaccines
03:31
so yes it hurts but it's important to
03:33
get
03:34
a vaccine people will say shot have you
03:36
gotten your
03:37
shots yet or i need to get a shot so to
03:40
get a shot
03:42
get a
03:45
shot because it's like a shot
03:48
that you get in your arm and that's
03:50
usually a vaccine
03:51
for something that will prevent you from
03:53
getting sick
03:54
nowadays we hear a lot about the flu
03:57
shot the flu shot
03:58
it's a vaccine to prevent you from
04:00
getting the flu and people will take it
04:02
every year before winter starts to
04:05
protect them from
04:06
the flu okay next one three
04:09
sharing equally with others so these two
04:13
artists or producers or i'm not sure
04:15
what's going on here
04:16
they're sharing their award equally what
04:19
they have that
04:20
award what do they have they have it in
04:23
common
04:24
if you have something in common with
04:25
somebody that means you share that
04:27
condition or that attribute right if
04:30
you and your mother are very similar
04:34
in appearance right your appearance you
04:37
share
04:37
your appearance in common if you and
04:39
your father have the same
04:41
sense of humor right you share that same
04:44
sense of humor
04:45
then you have a sense of humor in common
04:48
it means you have something similar to
04:50
somebody else
04:52
okay next one number four whoa that's
04:54
kind of a funny looking picture right
04:56
here's a little boy and he's meeting his
04:59
younger brother or sister but not yet
05:02
his younger brother or sister is still
05:03
in his mommy's
05:04
belly right having a baby growing inside
05:08

05:08
so mom here what can we say about mom
05:10
she has a baby
05:12
inside of her womb inside of her belly
05:15
right
05:16
it's she is pregnant so she is
05:19
pregnant sometimes people say she's with
05:22
child but she is pregnant okay
05:26
next one difficult something that is
05:28
very difficult to do
05:30
like climb uh the rocks without a shirt
05:33
on
05:33
that's that's tough okay i'm just
05:35
kidding about without the shirt on
05:37
it's it's tough even with a shirt on but
05:40
it's difficult
05:41
it's tough right so they're synonyms
05:44
basically if you say something is very
05:45
difficult you can say oh it's very
05:47
tough right for example if you have a
05:50
difficult
05:50
test you can say whoa that test was very
05:54
tough it was a tough test it was a
05:57
difficult test
05:59
right it was tough or it was difficult
06:02
next one
06:03
when a doctor cuts you open
06:07
and fixes you that's what's going on
06:09
here and this is
06:11
this is something that's extreme right
06:14
oh thankfully it's not very
06:15
common but sometimes some people maybe
06:18
us
06:19
maybe you maybe me might have a
06:21
situation
06:22
where the doctor needs to cut actually
06:25
cut open our body
06:26
and fix something inside to help
06:30
cure us what do we call that procedure
06:33
we say it is surgery okay
06:36
now the verb that we usually use with
06:38
surgery is
06:40
perform the doctor will perform
06:44
surgery uh or i need to
06:47
another way that we call this is
06:50
operation
06:51
an operation
06:54
i need to have
06:58
an operation so if i say if i'm in the
07:00
hospital and i say
07:02
i have to have an operation that means
07:05
the doctor will perform
07:07
surgery on me right the doctor performs
07:11
surgery on me i need to have
07:15
an operation those are the common ways
07:18
that we talk about this situation
07:21
also surgery can be used as an adjective
07:23
for example
07:24
the surgery room uh this is the
07:28
surgery preparation room or this is the
07:31
surgery
07:32
area of the hospital so sometimes
07:35
surgery can also be an adjective
07:37
not just a noun okay but remember when
07:39
it is a noun
07:40
we usually use say perform surgery and
07:43
we
07:44
also say i need to have an operation or
07:47
you need an operation that's the same
07:49
idea
07:50
okay so a couple of common expressions
07:52
for that situation
07:54
next one a visit to the doctor to check
07:58
your health now you should do this every
08:00
year some people go every six months
08:02
right maybe when they're younger it's
08:04
important to do that but you need to
08:06
regularly go to the doctor to check
08:10
your health and that's part of the word
08:12
right
08:13
check up because the doctor needs to
08:16
check
08:16
on you you need to check to make sure
08:19
you're not sick
08:21
it's called a checkup and usually people
08:23
go once a year for their annual
08:25
checkup okay number eight
08:29
a person who treats people for
08:31
sicknesses and injuries
08:34
when you go to the doctor to check for
08:36
sicknesses or if you have an injury
08:38
who do you go to what do you call that
08:40
person i think i just said it doctor
08:42
right this person this lady
08:44
she is a doctor right and there are many
08:46
different types of doctors right
08:49
some doctors will only specialize in
08:52
like the nose
08:53
the throat and the ears some doctors
08:56
will only specialize in treating
08:58
children some doctors will only
09:00
specialize
09:01
in fixing broken bones right there are
09:03
many different types of doctors
09:06
okay number nine happening at the same
09:09
time
09:10
every time so this is like uh uh
09:13
something that happens every time if you
09:15
wind this up this is
09:16
what musicians usually use right it goes
09:18
tick tick tick tick
09:21
every time at a certain time what do we
09:23
say
09:24
it's regular it's regular clocks
09:27
are regular they show us the time
09:31
all the time every time right and one
09:33
hour they go around the clock
09:35
regularly or clocks are very regular we
09:37
can depend on them
09:39
sometimes we have habits that are
09:41
regular for example every morning you
09:43
get up
09:44
you take a shower you brush your teeth
09:45
or eat breakfast then you brush your
09:47
teeth
09:48
that's your regular morning routine
09:50
that's regular
09:51
if you do something different that's
09:53
unusual right that would be the opposite
09:55
but happening at the same time every
09:57
time that's
09:59
regular okay next one
10:04
right we have a couple of cows here a
10:05
baby cow right
10:07
animals will have different names for
10:11
different sexes right male or female
10:14
they'll also have different names
10:15
for their age right we we don't really
10:18
say
10:19
we can't say baby cow but you could also
10:22
say
10:22
calf calf is more specific right
10:25
a baby horse you could say it's a baby
10:28
horse
10:28
or you could say it's a cult
10:32
right you could say a baby dog or you
10:35
can say
10:36
puppy right isn't it interesting in
10:39
english i don't know if it's the same in
10:41
korean but
10:42
in english we have all these special
10:44
words for baby
10:46
animals they're usually a lot different
10:48
right
10:49
there's also cub right for bears
10:52
and lions and tigers have cubs dogs have
10:56
puppies horses have colts cows have
11:00
calves oh so many words to remember
11:03
okay but it's very interesting okay next
11:06
one
11:06
oh what's wrong with him he had a bad
11:10
haircut
11:10
right he should sue his barber no i'm
11:13
just kidding
11:14
he wanted it that way obviously you have
11:16
to you have to
11:18
specifically ask for this type of
11:20
haircut okay
11:21
strange and unusual i'm making a comment
11:24
about it because it's not normal to see
11:26
somebody
11:26
with a haircut like this it is yeah you
11:29
could say
11:30
weird okay be strange she's unusual
11:33
you could also say unique
11:37
now it's interesting because if we say
11:39
weird weird has a little bit of a
11:41
negative
11:43
feeling to it you say it's weird it's
11:45
like oh that's weird
11:47
but if you say it's unique that can have
11:50
a little bit of a positive feeling about
11:51
it
11:52
so it depends on how you look at the
11:55
situation
11:56
if you look at him and says wow that's
11:58
cool he's unique
11:59
or you can look at him and say oh that's
12:02
not good it's
12:03
weird okay so be careful using weird
12:07
because weird usually means you have a
12:09
negative feeling
12:10
about something or unique can be
12:13
if you have a positive feeling about
12:14
something but it's strange it's unusual
12:16
then say oh that's unique okay so that's
12:20
more polite or better feeling associated
12:22
with unique
12:23
then weird okay so that's interesting
12:26
about these words here
12:28
next a container for carrying something
12:31
this is a container for carrying
12:33
something if you have to carry your pet
12:34
for example you will carry your pet in a
12:37
carrier
12:38
usually we only use this word though
12:41
it's usually
12:42
used for transporting animals a carrier
12:46
if you have a container for carrying
12:48
your books
12:50
you don't call it a carrier you call it
12:51
a backpack if you have a container for
12:54
carrying your food
12:55
to a school or to your office we don't
12:58
really call it a carrier you could but
13:00
it's a little strange
13:01
we just say it's a food container or if
13:03
you use the brand name it's tupperware
13:06
right so we carrier is usually
13:08
specifically used for
13:10
a container that carries animals for
13:13
transportation
13:14
next one number 13 a place where animals
13:17
are raised for food
13:19
now a lot of people they don't know
13:20
where their food comes from they think
13:22
oh
13:22
food comes from the supermarket but
13:24
that's not true
13:25
where does the supermarket get the food
13:27
the supermarket is not the original
13:29
place
13:30
where the food comes from the food comes
13:32
from animals
13:33
a lot of animals and also plants uh
13:36
where the animals are raised for food
13:38
like for example pork
13:40
or uh beef sogogy right if you want to
13:43
have
13:44
uh sorry i
13:47
bulgogi i had a hard time just
13:50
remembering that
13:51
bulgogi or duiji kalbi right that
13:54
meat comes from where it comes from a
13:57
farm
13:58
okay we say it's a farm where animals
14:01
are raised
14:02
for food okay sometimes people will also
14:05
call it
14:06
a ranch but a ranch has a little bit of
14:09
a different idea
14:10
a ranch is much bigger than a farm and a
14:13
ranch is usually where
14:14
you have a lot of cows or
14:18
cattle that's usually where cattle is
14:21
is raised and it's usually very big
14:23
farms tend to be small
14:25
and farms are also places where they
14:27
grow plants
14:28
like corn wheat things like that
14:31
but our ranch is where usually
14:34
specifically for
14:35
cows we have very big groups herds
14:38
of of cattle okay so anyway farm
14:41
and ranch usually we talk about farm a
14:44
place where animals are raised for food
14:46
okay next one now she looks like she's
14:49
doing yoga
14:50
right and she's stretching her body so
14:52
that her hands are pointing where
14:54
they're facing away from the front front
14:57
her fingers are
14:58
pointing away from her front they are
15:00
pointing
15:01
backward okay now if you turn around
15:04
right right now i'm i'm looking at you
15:06
i'm looking at you in the front
15:08
but i can turn this way now i'm looking
15:10
backward okay
15:12
it just means facing away from the front
15:14
looking backward or
15:16
stretching backward okay
15:19
next one a doctor who cares for animals
15:23
now there's a very long word
15:25
veterinarian we'll see that word later
15:27
in the reading
15:28
veterinarian but that's a hinduroa word
15:31
to pronounce
15:32
so a lot of people just say that so
15:34
veterinarian
15:37
just say vet because it's a lot easier
15:39
and most people just say
15:40
vet a vet is a doctor who cares for
15:43
animals
15:43
but be careful because vet
15:46
sometimes also can mean something else
15:50
that is completely
15:51
different a veteran a veteran
15:55
is a soldier who served in
15:58
a war or served for their country in the
16:00
military
16:01
sometimes people will call those people
16:03
a vet too
16:05
he's a vet he served in the iraq war
16:08
they're not talking about a person who
16:09
cares for animals okay
16:11
so be careful that can mean a former
16:15
ex-soldier right a person who used to be
16:17
a soldier
16:18
or it can be a doctor who cares for
16:20
animals so be careful don't be confused
16:23
if somebody says vet you have to know
16:25
the situation
16:26
what is the context of the situation
16:29
okay last word
16:33
kenjiro
16:36
a hard cover that goes over a part of
16:38
your body now unfortunately this girl
16:40
she
16:41
doesn't seem to be upset about it but
16:43
she's been injured right
16:44
she probably broke or sprained
16:47
her ankle or her foot so she has to
16:51
put something on that part of her body
16:54
to keep
16:54
the bones from moving you want to keep
16:56
the bones in the same position so they
16:58
can heal
17:00
together now when i first came to korea
17:03
it was konglish people called it gips
17:06
right gips but that's konglish the word
17:10
is
17:10
cast now i was very confused i was like
17:13
why do my students call this a gips
17:17
where does that come from well i learned
17:19
that this is made
17:21
of the same material that chalk white
17:23
chalk in your classroom is made of
17:25
and that's gypsum ah very interesting
17:29
so gibs comes from the material
17:32
that the caste is made from right and so
17:35
i don't know
17:36
where that started whether it comes from
17:38
japan or or you know
17:39
a lot of congress comes from japan i
17:41
don't know where that came from
17:43
but some somewhere people were thinking
17:45
okay well the cast is made of gypsum
17:48
so they just thought gipps and they
17:50
called it that well that's congress
17:51
americans don't have any idea about that
17:54
it confused me
17:56
when i first heard it i'm like where
17:57
does that come from we normally just say
18:00
cast right and you put a cast on it or
18:03
you
18:04
wear a cast just like a shoe
18:07
or a shirt you wear a cast wear a cast
18:11
okay or you could say the doctor put a
18:14
cast
18:15
on my foot now even though you wear it
18:17
it's not like a shoe
18:18
you can't take it off and put it back on
18:21
right
18:21
the doctor puts it on and then six weeks
18:24
later the doctor has to cut
18:26
it off right so it's not normal piece of
18:29
clothing but we use the same verb
18:32
wear a cast i have to wear a cast for
18:35
six
18:35
months and don't say this that's
18:38
konglish
18:39
okay let's review how well do we
18:42
remember these words
18:43
uh let's go over the uh comprehension
18:46
questions here
18:48
just the same as usual we have a blank
18:50
we need to choose the best word
18:52
to fill in the blank number one smallpox
18:56
i talked about that before smallpox was
18:59
a disease
19:00
a hundred years ago 200 years ago
19:02
terrible disease killed many many people
19:05
it was a sickness that is gone now
19:08
thanks to people getting what remember i
19:10
told you
19:10
when you're young it's important to get
19:12
that medicine to get a shot
19:14
what's in the shot is it a checkup is it
19:16
a vaccine
19:17
is it an injury or is it a doctor well
19:20
of course it's not a doctor you can't
19:21
put a person inside that shot that's
19:23
crazy
19:24
it's not an injury that doesn't make
19:26
sense it's not a checkup
19:27
it's of course a vaccine right
19:31
thanks to people getting the vaccine
19:33
smallpox is gone
19:34
nobody ever gets smallpox anymore
19:37
because
19:38
medicine has advanced so much that we
19:40
just get the
19:41
vaccine and the disease has died out in
19:44
human beings it's not there anymore
19:46
okay number two the pilot was beep badly
19:49
when his plane crashed
19:51
think about that somebody's flying a
19:52
plane and they don't land correctly the
19:55
plane crashes
19:56
well what's going to happen the pilot
19:58
was what celebrated
19:59
injured pregnant or treated you can't
20:03
get pregnant from crashing your plane
20:05
that's crazy okay
20:08
you're probably not going to be
20:09
celebrated with celebrated badly that
20:11
doesn't make any sense celebrated is a
20:13
good thing
20:14
uh treated he was treated badly when his
20:17
plane crashed that's possible actually
20:19
right
20:20
people said oh you shouldn't have
20:21
crashed a plane but more logically
20:24
he was injured badly that makes more
20:27
sense because of course when you think
20:28
about it
20:29
if you crash a plane or even if you
20:31
crash a car
20:32
or even your bicycle you crash you could
20:35
get
20:35
badly injured so be careful when you're
20:38
in a vehicle
20:39
or riding your bike you can become
20:42
injured
20:43
badly when your vehicle crashes whether
20:46
it's a plane it's a car
20:48
or a bike be careful and follow the
20:50
safety
20:51
rules and regulations okay number five
20:54
skipping up to number five
20:56
i get along well with my girlfriend do
20:58
you have a girlfriend or boyfriend
21:00
okay do you get along well with that
21:03
person
21:04
we have a lot what if you get along with
21:08
your girlfriend it doesn't have to be
21:09
girlfriend it could just be friend
21:11
you get along well with your friend
21:14
because we have a lot of what of
21:15
problems
21:17
we have a lot of boredom we have a lot
21:19
to forget
21:21
or we have a lot in common what makes
21:24
sense
21:25
if you have a lot of problems with your
21:27
girlfriend you don't get along well
21:29
maybe it's time to break up and
21:30
and go find somebody else who you don't
21:33
have problems with
21:34
uh we have a lot of boredom that doesn't
21:37
make sense right
21:38
that does you get along with somebody
21:40
because you're both bored together
21:41
that's ysung hail
21:43
we have a lot to forget strange too we
21:46
have a lot in common
21:47
ah remember in common means you share
21:50
something with somebody else so if you
21:53
share something with somebody else
21:54
you can understand them better so if you
21:57
have a lot
21:58
and we say a lot in common that's a
22:00
common expression
22:01
we have a lot in common then
22:05
you get along with the other person if
22:07
you don't get along with somebody
22:09
you can say we have nothing in common
22:12
that's the pandiro that's the opposite
22:14
right so if you meet somebody
22:16
you think they could be my friend but
22:18
they're very different from you
22:20
they don't like the same things that you
22:22
do they don't like the same movies or
22:24
the same
22:25
music they don't like the same books
22:27
they don't like the same hobbies that
22:28
you do
22:29
you're not going to be able to spend a
22:31
lot of time with them
22:32
because you don't like the things they
22:34
do you don't have
22:35
anything in common you have nothing in
22:38
common
22:38
but on the other situation if you have
22:41
many things in common
22:42
you have a lot in common you like the
22:45
same books you like the same hobbies
22:47
you like the same movies then you can
22:49
get along with that person well
22:51
okay number seven i can't believe you're
22:55
beep and you're going to have twins have
22:58
twins that means that somebody is going
23:01
to have babies now remember what we
23:03
talked about what's that word
23:04
if somebody has a baby in their belly
23:07
what are they are they necessary are
23:09
they small
23:10
are they slow or are they pregnant well
23:12
of course the only one that makes sense
23:13
is pregnant i can't believe you're
23:15
