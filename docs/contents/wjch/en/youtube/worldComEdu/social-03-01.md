how many types of groups do you belong
to
or do you know about in your home
or in your neighborhood in your life
in this unit we will discover different
types of groups
we will also discover different roles
or parts that people play
in groups are you interested
i am let's take a look first at the
vocabulary
our first word is grown-up
a grown-up is another word for adult
your mother and your father are adults
they are grown-ups one day
you will be a grown-up okay next word
group a group is a
collection of people right several
people two people
that's a pair right two people is a pair
right three people or more
that's a group a number of people who
live
work or play together right
who live work or play together
already you can see they're different
types of groups people who live together
one type of group people who work
together another type of group
people who play together could be
another type of group
okay so many different types types of
groups
types of
groups okay
next word is team a team is a
type of group remember i just said live
together work together
play together well a team is a group
that plays together
right a group of people who are on the
same
side in a game do you play soccer
if you play soccer you're part of a
soccer team
you play on the same side right another
team
they are the opposing team
a posing
team right you try to
beat them in the game right
a group of people who are on the same
side in a game
a soccer team or you know many different
types of team
could be a chess team could be a tennis
team
many types of teams
now here we have a video now it says
team here but
what kind of team is this what is going
on what is what do you see
this is very interesting let's take a
look these people look like
surfers
sir fur
z-s because there's many of them a
surfer is someone who rides a board when
the wave comes
let's check out the video here now
they're moving you can see that they're
moving and they're getting closer
and the water is getting uh higher
in front of them right but they're using
their arms and they're swimming through
the water
and they're going to uh when the water
gets up high
and they can go down the wave they can
stand up on their board and go down
now they're probably all part of the
same surfing team
you think about surfers are usually
individuals
in the video
an individual is one person not on a
team
but these are people are all together
maybe they're on the same
surfing team okay good
next we have class now class has many
different meanings
in this meaning it means a group of
students
who study together at school think about
your school you go and you study math
that is your math class
when you say are you in my class
you're talking about the group of people
who are
in the same room with the same teacher
at the same time that is your math class
i am part of your math class now
somebody who's
taking that subject they're studying
math but they're studying an
hour earlier than you maybe the same
teacher
maybe the same room but different time
they're not
part of your class your class is the
same group
of students who are studying in the same
room
with the same teacher at the same time
okay that is your class that's one
meaning of class
so a group of students who study
together at school
this looks like a nice uh nice friendly
class that's a good class yeah they like
each other
that's good okay next we have
guardian that's a hindu that's a
difficult word
guardian a guardian is someone who
protects
and takes care of a child like
a parent now that's interesting because
parents are also
guardians parent is a guardian your
mother
and your father is a guardian but
sometimes they're busy they
can't take care of you so they you know
they
they bring you to school and during
school time
your teacher is your guardian they take
care of you and they protect you
if need be if you're too young to go to
school maybe you go
to a daycare center and the people there
are your guardians maybe your mom and
dad
have some important business or for some
strange reason
they have to leave for a few days they
might give you
to your grandma or your grandpa
or an uncle or an aunt and then
they will be your guardian until your
parents come back
so a guardian is usually an adult
who takes care of you like a parent they
protect you
and they you know they take care of you
uh
while your parents are gone but your
parents are also guardians
okay so good
finally we have parents parents are the
father and the mother
of a person right parents are usually
two well two
right you have a man you have a woman
those are the parents they get together
they have a baby they are the parents
of the baby you have parents someday you
will grow up
you might meet um a handsome guy or a
beautiful woman
or just actually meet someone who you
like
who is your friend and that person you
can get together with them
you might have children of your own then
you will be
a parent too you and your best friend
will be best will be parents s
right parents okay good next we have
belong to now we've talked about groups
groups are you know three or more people
usually we talk about more people but
you have an individual right
who joins the group they belong to this
group which we can use those two words
belong to i belong to this group
remember i talked about
classes are you in my class yes
i belong to your class or we belong
to the same class that means to be
a member of a group i belong to
this team i belong to this group
okay good next we have
raise one's hand what do you do in class
well you raise your hand if you have a
question do you have a question
raise your hand i can't are you raising
your i'm sorry
of course i can't see if you're raising
your hand but if you have a question
in class you should raise your hand
don't just say it
raise your hand so that's something
that's kind of a
rule that you should follow when you're
in a group like a class so different
groups have different rules
and raising your hand is a rule
for that group it's a rule a rule is
something that you should
do as part of that group okay
those are that's our vocabulary for this
lesson
now let's take a closer look
okay we're taking a closer look at types
of groups and as i said before
think about the different kinds of
groups or different types of groups
right by the way it says types of groups
you could also say
kinds of kinds of
equals types
means the same thing kinds of groups
types of groups
so what kinds of groups do you belong to
you can say i belong to many groups in
this picture
in this diagram we can see well
everybody has a family right so you
belong to a
family that is a group in this case it's
four people could be three people
could even be two people right uh
parents before they have
parents before they have a kid that
doesn't make sense
a husband and wife before they have
a child a child they are not parents yet
but if they have a child then they are
parents okay so a family is a group
right that's a group that almost
everybody belongs to
a school class when you're young
right you go to school you are a member
of your
school class by the way that's i just
said something important
member
of a
group so remember is also an important
word when we talk about
groups right you are a member
of group that means you are one person
part of the group
right so you were a member of your
school class
okay so school class you were a member
you belong to that group
maybe from your school group you know
you might get together oh this
this math class is very difficult i
should study
with some other students in my class
so let's make a study group and you get
together after school
and you study that subject that is a
study group
right so hopefully you can learn
more in your study group after school
finally we have sports teams sports team
is another
kind of group or type of
group and probably you belong to a
sports team
maybe do you play tennis do you play
soccer
do you play badminton right you probably
belong to a team in that case and you
play sports together
it's a good way to stay healthy right
okay so those are different
types of groups now
in each group we can talk about roles
that's something i said at the very
beginning of this lesson you will
discover
the different roles that people play a
role is uh something that
a person does in a group a role
a leader plays a role right
they are the leader of the group right
so they have a role
now this is different from rules don't
get those too confused right
so a leader of a group will
have rules for that group to make sure
that everybody
uh gets along and the group
is efficient or the group
is successful okay so leaders
leaders a leader leads people in a group
most groups have leaders here we have a
picture right
and we see the arrow right here the
arrow pointing to this gentleman here
right and that gentleman that man
he looks like the coach okay this looks
like a
soccer team because we see the soccer
balls over here
so this is a soccer team and that man
is the coach when i was younger i did
the same thing i used to coach
uh young you know kids who were much
younger than me of course
i was already an adult i was a young
adult
and somebody asked me hey can you be a
coach for our soccer league i said sure
because i played soccer
when i was young so when i grew up they
remembered hey you played soccer can you
be a soccer coach
for the younger kids yeah sure it's kind
of a cycle that happens
but yeah that's important we need to
have coaches we need to have
teachers we need to have responsible
adults
who help lead groups
in our society because um these kids
they need to
have some instruction they need to have
somebody saying okay
i'll let can you do this and you do that
you do that
and to be a leader of the group now in
the groups we have
rules over on the other side we have
rules and this is
class rules so not soccer team but in
your class
you have class rules and rules help
people work together and be safe
in a group so rules
kind of like help people work together
and make sure that thing
that everything is fair that people know
what they're supposed to do
and also to make sure that everybody is
safe in the group so what are some class
rules you should listen when someone
else is
speaking it's a good idea right somebody
else is speaking
don't try to talk at the same time
listen to them
another rule work quietly at your desk
don't make a lot of noise don't play
with your partner
if the teacher says do the exercise
then work quietly at your desk
the next rule remember the vocabulary
expression we learned
raise your hand when you need help if
you're doing your exercise
oh i don't know this one
raise your hand your teacher will come
okay
that's a good rule then the next rule
number fourth rule wow
that is an important rule for every
group and in life
you're part of the human race that's a
group number four
very important treat others with respect
right that is a very important rule you
should always follow that rule
no matter what the group is in every
group
treat others with respect respect other
people
good next rule play
safely make wise choices i know
sometimes we get excited right we get
oh i really want to do this or
something's fun but just be
wise you know make sure you think about
if we do this
could it hurt somebody you don't want to
hurt anybody
so play safely be safe
and don't hurt yourself either right
don't do something crazy
that might hurt you right so play safely
right make wise choices
and finally respect the personal
property of others if your neighbor has
a pen
don't just take the pen right say may i
borrow your pen
may i use your pen right it's their pen
or their book or their bag
don't take it don't damage it respect
other people's property but of course
that's also very similar to
just respect other people treat others
with respect
again i emphasize really strongly that's
an important rule
okay that's a very good rule okay so
that's our close look
next let's take a look at the reading
okay we'll read a passage together
and practice the vocabulary
okay let's take a look at the reading
together and
as i read i encourage you to either read
with me out loud or read in your
mind at the same time that i'm reading
so that you
can practice the vocabulary that we
learned
and you can also focus on the
pronunciation
okay so let's begin the reading are you
ready
let's begin children
and grown-ups belong to groups
there are many different kinds of
groups i belong to my
family school class
sports team and study group
wow lots of groups okay very busy
next in my family
i am a son and
i am a brother to my sister
we listen to what our parents
tell us in my class
when we have a question we raise our
hands
and ask that's the rule
of my class okay
i am a goalkeeper
on my school's soccer team
i'm going to stop right there just i
want to highlight goalkeeper
goalkeeper is a position on a team
it is also another type
of role right before i said roll
there are many different types of roles
a leader is a role the coach is a role
a goalkeeper is a role now in soccer of
course you have different positions
right
you have full back half back and forward
maybe you have different words in
different countries that's what i
learned when i was a kid
so uh these are different roles right
and each person
has their own role to play
a role to
this is r roll to play
you have a whoops you have a role to
play
so whether you're a goalkeeper uh full
back
half back or forward those are different
roles
and you have different functions on your
team okay so
i am a goalkeeper on my school's soccer
team
and we practice once a week
after school it's not enough
two times three times a week okay anyway
that's i used to be a coach okay
i am also a member of a study group
we meet after class every day
okay my friend's
uncle helps us with our homework
he is my friend tom's guardian he
takes care of tom instead of
his parents okay that's interesting
right
tom's parents there might be some
problem or some issue you know sad to
say you know sometimes
kids in your class maybe their parents
are not there anymore right it's a sad
story but sometimes
uh that can happen but hopefully a
relative
like an uncle right your father's
brother
or your sister's brother i'm sorry your
father's brother or your mother's
brother not your sister's brother all
right your father's brother or your
mother's brother is your uncle and if
your mom and your dad
aren't able to take care of you then
hopefully
our relative can take care of you and
they will be your guardian
but remember parents are also guardians
they're your natural guardians
but there might be other guardians who
take care of you
take care of
okay good next last sentence
at the end of class and our group
study we have to pick up
all our things okay we have to
we have to have to that means it's a
rule
you have to follow the rules follow
the rules okay
so follow the rules of your group one of
the rules of this group is that at the
end of class they have to pick up all
their things that's a good rule
make sure that the classroom is clean
after you leave okay
now let's get into the reading skill for
every reading passage
we can organize it we can see how the
reading passage
is organized right in this reading
passage
this reading passage is talking about
groups that is the main idea right
you have you know at the top you think
okay what is the main idea of the
of the passage that's groups and then
you have details right
and in this case you have a main idea
but you have types of the main idea this
is a very
common organization for
writing passages now what is the main
idea and then what are the details
of that idea in this case like i said
the main idea
is that people belong to what beep they
belong to
of course we know this they belong to
groups
now you could put groups or you could
put
types oops types
of groups whoops
i'm sorry that doesn't look like that
that looks like an r
but i went too far on the oh sorry
types of groups or you could just say
groups too you don't have to say
children and grownups belong to groups
or children and grown-ups belong to
types of groups this unit is types of
groups
so let's use types of groups children
and grown-ups belong to
types of groups and that's better anyway
because
that's what the passage is going to be
talking about it's going to be talking
about
types of groups so it's better to use
that
so the first detail is
class the second detail is
team the third detail is study group
okay so one two three let's take a look
in my class we raise our hands and
ask that's the what remember we talked
about this
thing behavior that you should do in the
group to keep people safe
and to make sure everyone works together
well that's
the rule okay
that is the rule that's the rule
so different groups have different rules
so in my class we raise our hands and
ask that's
the rule okay the second detail the
second type
of group is a team right i'm a
goalkeeper on my school's
soccer i just set it team
so that's the second detail first the
first detail was class
second detail is team okay and the third
detail
is class and group study
right okay well mainly group study okay
so
at the end of class and group study we
have to beep
all our things you have to do what to
all your things well it's the end of the
time to be together
you want to leave the area clean
you want to make sure that you have all
your stuff so
you need to pick up we have to pick
up pick up
we have to pick up all our things we we
have to have to remember have to is
a rule okay get that over my head
okay we have to pick up all our things
that's a rule of the group right back
here
we see rule so in this unit
we talked about different types of
groups we saw there are many
types of groups and you probably belong
to many types of groups you belong to
your family
you go to school so you belong to a
class if you play a sport you belong
to a team belong to belong to belong to
right
okay and in these groups we have
rules that you should follow follow
the rules rules in the class
raise your hand if you need help raise
your hand
if you have a question at the
end of class pick up your stuff you have
to pick up your stuff
that is a rule groups are
important they help us work together and
they help make sure that we are
safe with each other and most
importantly groups
teach us to respect others
that is a very important rule okay
well i hope you enjoyed this lesson and
we'll see you in the next one take care

side in a game do you play soccer
02:30
if you play soccer you're part of a
02:32
soccer team
02:33

many types of teams
03:06
now here we have a video now it says
03:08
team here but
03:09
what kind of team is this what is going
03:11
on what is what do you see
03:14
this is very interesting let's take a
03:15
look these people look like
03:18
surfers
03:21
sir fur
03:24
z-s because there's many of them a
03:26
surfer is someone who rides a board when
03:29
the wave comes
03:30
let's check out the video here now
03:32
they're moving you can see that they're
03:34
moving and they're getting closer
03:35
and the water is getting uh higher
03:39
in front of them right but they're using
03:41
their arms and they're swimming through
03:43
the water
03:44
and they're going to uh when the water
03:46
gets up high
03:47
and they can go down the wave they can
03:50
stand up on their board and go down
03:52
now they're probably all part of the
03:54
same surfing team
03:56
you think about surfers are usually
03:58
individuals
04:00
in the video
04:04
an individual is one person not on a
04:07
team
04:07
but these are people are all together
04:10
maybe they're on the same
04:11
surfing team okay good
04:15
next we have class now class has many
04:19
different meanings
04:21
in this meaning it means a group of
04:23
students
04:24
who study together at school think about
04:28
your school you go and you study math
04:30
that is your math class
04:32
when you say are you in my class
04:36
you're talking about the group of people
04:38
who are
04:39
in the same room with the same teacher
04:42
at the same time that is your math class
04:46
i am part of your math class now
04:48
somebody who's
04:49
taking that subject they're studying
04:52
math but they're studying an
04:53
hour earlier than you maybe the same
04:56
teacher
04:56
maybe the same room but different time
04:59
they're not
05:00
part of your class your class is the
05:02
same group
05:03
of students who are studying in the same
05:06
room
05:06
with the same teacher at the same time
05:10
okay that is your class that's one
05:12
meaning of class
05:13
so a group of students who study
05:15
together at school
05:16
this looks like a nice uh nice friendly
05:19
class that's a good class yeah they like
05:21
each other
05:22
that's good okay next we have
05:25
guardian that's a hindu that's a
05:28
difficult word
05:29
guardian a guardian is someone who
05:32
protects
05:33
and takes care of a child like
05:36
a parent now that's interesting because
05:40
parents are also
05:41
guardians parent is a guardian your
05:44
mother
05:44
and your father is a guardian but
05:47
sometimes they're busy they
05:49
can't take care of you so they you know
05:51
they
05:52
they bring you to school and during
05:54
school time
05:55
your teacher is your guardian they take
05:58
care of you and they protect you
06:01
if need be if you're too young to go to
06:05
school maybe you go
06:06
to a daycare center and the people there
06:10
are your guardians maybe your mom and
06:13
dad
06:14
have some important business or for some
06:16
strange reason
06:17
they have to leave for a few days they
06:20
might give you
06:21
to your grandma or your grandpa
06:24
or an uncle or an aunt and then
06:27
they will be your guardian until your
06:30
parents come back
06:32
so a guardian is usually an adult
06:35
who takes care of you like a parent they
06:38
protect you
06:39
and they you know they take care of you
06:42
uh
06:43
while your parents are gone but your
06:44
parents are also guardians
06:46
okay so good
06:49

06:52
father and the mother
06:53
of a person right parents are usually
06:55
two well two
06:56
right you have a man you have a woman
06:58

07:11
beautiful woman
07:12
or just actually meet someone who you
07:14
like
07:15
who is your friend and that person you
07:18
can get together with them
07:20
you might have children of your own then
07:22
you will be
07:23
a parent too you and your best friend
07:27
will be best will be parents s
07:30
right parents okay good next we have
07:34
belong to now we've talked about groups
07:37
groups are you know three or more people
07:38
usually we talk about more people but
07:41
you have an individual right
07:43
who joins the group they belong to this
07:46
group which we can use those two words
07:48
belong to i belong to this group
07:50
remember i talked about
07:52
classes are you in my class yes
07:55
i belong to your class or we belong
07:59
to the same class that means to be
08:03
a member of a group i belong to
08:06
this team i belong to this group
08:10
okay good next we have
08:13
raise one's hand what do you do in class
08:17
well you raise your hand if you have a
08:19
question do you have a question
08:21
raise your hand i can't are you raising
08:24
your i'm sorry
08:24
of course i can't see if you're raising
08:26
your hand but if you have a question
08:29
in class you should raise your hand
08:31
don't just say it
08:33
raise your hand so that's something
08:35
that's kind of a
08:36
rule that you should follow when you're
08:40
in a group like a class so different
08:43
groups have different rules
08:45
and raising your hand is a rule
08:50
for that group it's a rule a rule is
08:52
something that you should
08:54
do as part of that group okay
08:57
those are that's our vocabulary for this
09:00
lesson
09:00
now let's take a closer look
09:08
okay we're taking a closer look at types
09:11
of groups and as i said before
09:15
think about the different kinds of
09:17
groups or different types of groups
09:19
right by the way it says types of groups
09:21
you could also say
09:23
kinds of kinds of
09:27
equals types
09:31
means the same thing kinds of groups
09:33
types of groups
09:35
so what kinds of groups do you belong to
09:38
you can say i belong to many groups in
09:41
this picture
09:42
in this diagram we can see well
09:45
everybody has a family right so you
09:48
belong to a
09:50
family that is a group in this case it's
09:52
four people could be three people
09:54
could even be two people right uh
09:56
parents before they have
09:57
parents before they have a kid that
09:58
doesn't make sense
10:01
a husband and wife before they have
10:04
a child a child they are not parents yet
10:07
but if they have a child then they are
10:09
parents okay so a family is a group
10:12
right that's a group that almost
10:14
everybody belongs to
10:16
a school class when you're young
10:19
right you go to school you are a member
10:22
of your
10:23
school class by the way that's i just
10:25
said something important
10:27
member
10:30
of a
10:33
group so remember is also an important
10:37
word when we talk about
10:39
groups right you are a member
10:42
of group that means you are one person
10:44
part of the group
10:45
right so you were a member of your
10:48
school class
10:49
okay so school class you were a member
10:52
you belong to that group
10:55
maybe from your school group you know
10:57
you might get together oh this
10:59
this math class is very difficult i
11:02
should study
11:03
with some other students in my class
11:07
so let's make a study group and you get
11:09
together after school
11:11
and you study that subject that is a
11:14
study group
11:15
right so hopefully you can learn
11:18
more in your study group after school
11:23
finally we have sports teams sports team
11:26
is another
11:27
kind of group or type of
11:30
group and probably you belong to a
11:34
sports team
11:34
maybe do you play tennis do you play
11:37
soccer
11:38
do you play badminton right you probably
11:42
belong to a team in that case and you
11:45
play sports together
11:46
it's a good way to stay healthy right
11:49
okay so those are different
11:50
types of groups now
11:54
in each group we can talk about roles
11:57
that's something i said at the very
11:58
beginning of this lesson you will
12:00
discover
12:01
the different roles that people play a
12:04
role is uh something that
12:08
a person does in a group a role
12:12
a leader plays a role right
12:15
they are the leader of the group right
12:17
so they have a role
12:19
now this is different from rules don't
12:20
get those too confused right
12:22
so a leader of a group will
12:26
have rules for that group to make sure
12:29
that everybody
12:30
uh gets along and the group
12:34
is efficient or the group
12:38
is successful okay so leaders
12:42
leaders a leader leads people in a group
12:46
most groups have leaders here we have a
12:48
picture right
12:49
and we see the arrow right here the
12:51
arrow pointing to this gentleman here
12:53
right and that gentleman that man
12:57
he looks like the coach okay this looks
13:00
like a
13:01
soccer team because we see the soccer
13:03
balls over here
13:04
so this is a soccer team and that man
13:08
is the coach when i was younger i did
13:11
the same thing i used to coach
13:13
uh young you know kids who were much
13:15
younger than me of course
13:16
i was already an adult i was a young
13:18
adult
13:19
and somebody asked me hey can you be a
13:22
coach for our soccer league i said sure
13:25
because i played soccer
13:26
when i was young so when i grew up they
13:29
remembered hey you played soccer can you
13:31
be a soccer coach
13:32
for the younger kids yeah sure it's kind
13:34
of a cycle that happens
13:36
but yeah that's important we need to
13:38
have coaches we need to have
13:40
teachers we need to have responsible
13:43
adults
13:43
who help lead groups
13:46
in our society because um these kids
13:49
they need to
13:50
have some instruction they need to have
13:52
somebody saying okay
13:54
i'll let can you do this and you do that
13:56
you do that
13:57
and to be a leader of the group now in
14:00
the groups we have
14:01
rules over on the other side we have
14:03
rules and this is
14:04
class rules so not soccer team but in
14:07
your class
14:08
you have class rules and rules help
14:11
people work together and be safe
14:15
in a group so rules
14:18
kind of like help people work together
14:20
and make sure that thing
14:22
that everything is fair that people know
14:24
what they're supposed to do
14:26
and also to make sure that everybody is
14:28
safe in the group so what are some class
14:31
rules you should listen when someone
14:34
else is
14:34
speaking it's a good idea right somebody
14:37
else is speaking
14:38
don't try to talk at the same time
14:40
listen to them
14:42
another rule work quietly at your desk
14:46
don't make a lot of noise don't play
14:48
with your partner
14:50
if the teacher says do the exercise
14:53
then work quietly at your desk
14:57
the next rule remember the vocabulary
15:00
expression we learned
15:02
raise your hand when you need help if
15:04
you're doing your exercise
15:05
oh i don't know this one
15:09
raise your hand your teacher will come
15:12
okay
15:12
that's a good rule then the next rule
15:15
number fourth rule wow
15:16
that is an important rule for every
15:18
group and in life
15:21
you're part of the human race that's a
15:23
group number four
15:25
very important treat others with respect
15:30
right that is a very important rule you
15:33
should always follow that rule
15:34
no matter what the group is in every
15:37
group
15:38
treat others with respect respect other
15:41
people
15:42
good next rule play
15:45
safely make wise choices i know
15:49
sometimes we get excited right we get
15:52
oh i really want to do this or
15:53
something's fun but just be
15:55
wise you know make sure you think about
15:58
if we do this
15:59
could it hurt somebody you don't want to
16:02
hurt anybody
16:03
so play safely be safe
16:06
and don't hurt yourself either right
16:08
don't do something crazy
16:10
that might hurt you right so play safely
16:13
right make wise choices
16:16
and finally respect the personal
16:19
property of others if your neighbor has
16:21
a pen
16:22
don't just take the pen right say may i
16:24
borrow your pen
16:26
may i use your pen right it's their pen
16:29
or their book or their bag
16:31
don't take it don't damage it respect
16:35
other people's property but of course
16:37
that's also very similar to
16:39
just respect other people treat others
16:41
with respect
16:42
again i emphasize really strongly that's
16:46
an important rule
16:47
okay that's a very good rule okay so
16:50
that's our close look
16:51
next let's take a look at the reading
16:54
okay we'll read a passage together
16:56
and practice the vocabulary
17:00
okay let's take a look at the reading
17:02
together and
17:04
as i read i encourage you to either read
17:07
with me out loud or read in your
17:11
mind at the same time that i'm reading
17:14
so that you
17:15
can practice the vocabulary that we
17:17
learned
17:18
and you can also focus on the
17:20
pronunciation
17:22
okay so let's begin the reading are you
17:24
ready
17:25
let's begin children
17:29
and grown-ups belong to groups
17:34
there are many different kinds of
17:37
groups i belong to my
17:41
family school class
17:44
sports team and study group
17:48
wow lots of groups okay very busy
17:51
next in my family
17:54
i am a son and
17:58
i am a brother to my sister
18:02
we listen to what our parents
18:06
tell us in my class
18:09
when we have a question we raise our
18:13
hands
18:14
and ask that's the rule
18:18
of my class okay
18:23
i am a goalkeeper
18:26
on my school's soccer team
18:29
i'm going to stop right there just i
18:31
want to highlight goalkeeper
18:34
goalkeeper is a position on a team
18:37
it is also another type
18:41
of role right before i said roll
18:44
there are many different types of roles
18:46
a leader is a role the coach is a role
18:49
a goalkeeper is a role now in soccer of
18:52
course you have different positions
18:53
right
18:54
you have full back half back and forward
18:57
maybe you have different words in
18:58
different countries that's what i
19:00
learned when i was a kid
19:02
so uh these are different roles right
19:04
and each person
19:06
has their own role to play
19:09
a role to
19:12
this is r roll to play
19:16
you have a whoops you have a role to
19:19
play
19:19
so whether you're a goalkeeper uh full
19:22
back
19:23
half back or forward those are different
19:25
roles
19:26
and you have different functions on your
19:28
team okay so
19:30
i am a goalkeeper on my school's soccer
19:33
team
19:34
and we practice once a week
19:38
after school it's not enough
19:41
two times three times a week okay anyway
19:43
that's i used to be a coach okay
19:46
i am also a member of a study group
19:50
we meet after class every day
19:54
okay my friend's
19:57
uncle helps us with our homework
20:01
he is my friend tom's guardian he
20:06
takes care of tom instead of
20:09
his parents okay that's interesting
20:12
right
20:13
tom's parents there might be some
20:16
problem or some issue you know sad to
20:19
say you know sometimes
20:20
kids in your class maybe their parents
20:23
are not there anymore right it's a sad
20:26
story but sometimes
20:28
uh that can happen but hopefully a
20:31
relative
20:32
like an uncle right your father's
20:35
brother
20:36
or your sister's brother i'm sorry your
20:39
father's brother or your mother's
20:41
brother not your sister's brother all
20:43
right your father's brother or your
20:46
mother's brother is your uncle and if
20:49
your mom and your dad
20:50
aren't able to take care of you then
20:53
hopefully
20:54
our relative can take care of you and
20:56
they will be your guardian
20:58
but remember parents are also guardians
21:00
they're your natural guardians
21:02
but there might be other guardians who
21:04
take care of you
21:06
take care of
21:09
okay good next last sentence
21:13
at the end of class and our group
21:16
study we have to pick up
21:20
all our things okay we have to
21:23
we have to have to that means it's a
21:26
rule
21:28
you have to follow the rules follow
21:33
the rules okay
21:37
so follow the rules of your group one of
21:39
the rules of this group is that at the
21:42
end of class they have to pick up all
21:44
their things that's a good rule
21:46
make sure that the classroom is clean
21:49
after you leave okay
21:53
now let's get into the reading skill for
21:56
every reading passage
21:58
we can organize it we can see how the
22:00
reading passage
22:01
is organized right in this reading
22:04
passage
22:05
this reading passage is talking about
22:08
groups that is the main idea right
22:12
you have you know at the top you think
22:14
okay what is the main idea of the
22:16
of the passage that's groups and then
22:18
you have details right
22:20
and in this case you have a main idea
22:22
but you have types of the main idea this
22:24
is a very
22:26
common organization for
22:29
writing passages now what is the main
22:31
idea and then what are the details
22:34
of that idea in this case like i said
22:36
the main idea
22:37
is that people belong to what beep they
22:40
belong to
22:41
of course we know this they belong to
22:44
groups
22:46
now you could put groups or you could
22:48
put
22:49
types oops types
22:53
of groups whoops
22:56
i'm sorry that doesn't look like that
22:58
that looks like an r
22:59
but i went too far on the oh sorry
23:02
types of groups or you could just say
23:05
groups too you don't have to say
23:06
children and grownups belong to groups
23:08
or children and grown-ups belong to
23:10
types of groups this unit is types of
23:13
groups
23:14
so let's use types of groups children
23:17
and grown-ups belong to
23:18
types of groups and that's better anyway
23:21
because
23:22
that's what the passage is going to be
23:23
talking about it's going to be talking
23:25
about
23:25
types of groups so it's better to use
23:28
that
23:28
so the first detail is
23:32
class the second detail is
23:35
team the third detail is study group
23:39
okay so one two three let's take a look
23:42
in my class we raise our hands and
23:45
ask that's the what remember we talked
23:48
about this
23:50
thing behavior that you should do in the
23:52
group to keep people safe
23:54
and to make sure everyone works together
23:57
well that's
23:58
the rule okay
24:01
that is the rule that's the rule
24:04
so different groups have different rules
24:08
so in my class we raise our hands and
24:09
ask that's
24:11
the rule okay the second detail the
24:14
second type
24:15
of group is a team right i'm a
24:18
goalkeeper on my school's
24:20
soccer i just set it team
24:24
so that's the second detail first the
24:26
first detail was class
24:28
second detail is team okay and the third
24:31
detail
24:32
is class and group study
24:35
right okay well mainly group study okay
24:38
so
24:39
at the end of class and group study we
24:41
have to beep
24:42
all our things you have to do what to
24:46
all your things well it's the end of the
24:48
time to be together
24:50
you want to leave the area clean
24:53
you want to make sure that you have all
24:54
your stuff so
24:56
you need to pick up we have to pick
25:00
up pick up
25:04
we have to pick up all our things we we
25:07
have to have to remember have to is
25:10
a rule okay get that over my head
25:14
okay we have to pick up all our things
25:17
that's a rule of the group right back
25:20
here
25:21
we see rule so in this unit
25:24
we talked about different types of
25:26
groups we saw there are many
25:27
types of groups and you probably belong
25:30
to many types of groups you belong to
25:32
your family
25:34
you go to school so you belong to a
25:35
class if you play a sport you belong
25:38
to a team belong to belong to belong to
25:41
right
25:42
okay and in these groups we have
25:46
rules that you should follow follow
25:49
the rules rules in the class
25:52
raise your hand if you need help raise
25:55
your hand
25:56
if you have a question at the
25:59
end of class pick up your stuff you have
26:02
to pick up your stuff
26:03
that is a rule groups are
26:07
important they help us work together and
26:09
they help make sure that we are
26:11
safe with each other and most
26:13
importantly groups
26:15
teach us to respect others
26:18
that is a very important rule okay
26:22
well i hope you enjoyed this lesson and
26:25
we'll see you in the next one take care
26:27
everybody bye bye
