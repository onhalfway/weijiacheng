hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
we're on social studies book three in
the final lesson of the book lesson 15
wow time really goes by fast in lesson
15
we're talking about how we we
as humans we change our environment
so we will discover in this lesson how
humans
change the environment and also who
rachel carson was
interesting okay let's get started
okay the first word in the vocabulary is
plow p and l
together plow
so p and then l sound your tongue is
on the roof of your mouth behind your
front teeth la
plow plow to plow
is it's a verb so it means to
turn over a field it doesn't mean of
course to take the whole field and turn
it over
it means to take the dirt or the soil
in the field and with an instrument like
a hoe
and bring the dirt that's on the bottom
to the top and that's called turning
over a field
or land with a farming tool now i
mentioned a hoe but of course there are
many different ways to do it you can do
it by hand
which is very difficult takes a long
time
of course people used horses donkeys
cows oxes but nowadays of course people
use machinery and that's the picture
that we see
and as you can see you have one two
three four
four pieces of metal digging into the
earth so that does the work
of four people or four horses at one
time
so of course machinery has made our
lives a lot easier
and has made work much more efficient so
to plow a field is to turn over the land
why do farmers do that
because what they're trying to do is
they're trying to
get the soil that's underneath the
ground up on the surface
and also to help uh get air into the uh
the soil to break it up so that the
land will absorb water more easily and
of course these are good conditions for
growing plants
basically they're preparing the land to
make it
more suitable for growing plants
so that the plants will grow faster and
better and healthier
okay next we have harvest
so you plow the field in the spring
right in the springtime the
farmers are out plowing the land and
then they plant the seeds of course
over the summer time those plants will
grow in the fall
it's time to harvest now harvest can be
a noun
or a verb in this case it's a verb to
harvest means
to collect the crops so after the plants
have grown
and they have produced fruit or
vegetables or whatever it is the farmers
are growing
in the fall it's time to go out and
gather all those crops
to send it to the supermarket so to
collect crops or
plants from the fields and hopefully
farmers
look forward to a good
harvest and thanksgiving in the fall
is a celebration of hopefully a good
harvest okay it's a way to celebrate oh
good we
we you know we the planting season is
over
we've harvest all the food let's have a
big feast to celebrate that many
thanksgivings are like that
but they celebrate the harvest in that
case the harvest is a noun
so harvest can be noun or it can be verb
okay
builder a builder is a person
that builds very easy right we have er
many words have er it means a person who
does
the action indicated in the root
of the word in this case to build build
builder right at a at a restaurant
you know if you wait if your job is to
wait for the customer
you are a waiter or waitress right so er
we add it to to designate that that's a
person
who does that thing not always but it's
a very common pattern in english
so a builder is a person that makes
buildings
right in this case this gentleman here
he is making a brick wall he is putting
he is uh putting bricks together to make
a brick wall to
make a building okay so that's a builder
dig and of course you can say digger
right this person is a digger
right but here we just have the verb
right dig
to dig to dig means to make a hole
in soil soil dirt the ground
with a tool or hands oh
don't do that you'll get all dirt all
over your hands and under your
fingernails but you'll notice that dogs
like to dig holes not with their hands
of course with their paws but it's like
their hands but we call them paws
p-a-w-s
p-a-w-s but they're still digging right
dogs don't use a tool they're not out
there with a shovel right
they're using their their paws to dig a
hole so
any time that uh a person or an animal
creates a hole in the ground that verb
is called to dig
and some animals are very good at
digging right they make their homes
underground okay so that's to dig
tunnel now a tunnel if you dig deep
enough and you go down and then you go
you go not down but you go across right
or maybe you dig
through a mountain especially in this
case right
there's a town here in a town here and
there's a mountain in between
well people will dig a tunnel through
the mountain of course a tunnel
is just an underground path that is made
through a mountain or a hill
also it could also be under some
other geological feature like uh
uh water for example there's a very
famous tunnel
between britain and france and that goes
under the channel
of the british channel or the english
channel and basically that's a tunnel
that they dug that
had to go down right to go under the
water and it comes you know it goes down
in britain
and it comes back up in france or goes
down in france and
comes up in england so that is of
another famous tunnel right so it's any
underground path that is made through a
mountain
a hill or even under water or even
under the city many of your if you live
in a large city you might have a subway
system
and the subway tunnels are under the
city so
any underground path okay whether it's
for
you know an animal right animals dig
tunnels
a person a walking tunnel a cars or even
trains
subways whatever they're all we all call
those
tunnels okay
damn dam is another uh very huge
project an engineering project that
people will build
builders will build and a dam is a kind
of wall
and as you can see it's a wall that uh
holds
water back so it's a wall that
uh that prevents water
from flowing naturally now of course
water is allowed
to flow through the dam and in fact
that's a very good way
to collect that energy that would be a
hydroelectric
dam high dro hydro by the way means
water and electric of course you know
electric
electricity elec oops electric yeah i'm
gonna
pay more attention to spelling and a
little less attention to talking
hydroelectric so hydro means electricity
from water
right hydro means water right
so this is a good way many dams are
hydroelectric dams
they take that energy from the flowing
water and they convert that
uh energy into electricity which is
another form of
energy so a dam is a kind of wall that
is built across a river of course
you know you build it across the river
to prevent water from
flowing of course it doesn't prevent
you're not saying okay you don't want
any water to flow you do
want water to flow but what dams do
usually
is to regulate that water
so for example you might live in an area
where there's a lot of rain
and every year it might flood downstream
but if you build a dam there
then you can control the amount of water
and make sure the amount of water that's
flowing on the dam
is the same all year round no matter
what the weather conditions are
so that's one reason why people build
dams another reason why people build
dams is because they want to have a
supply
of fresh water for a nearby city for
example
um hoover dam this isn't hoover dam
no that's not hoover dam but there's a
famous hoover dam near las vegas in
nevada
and of course las vegas
uses a lot of the water that is dammed
up there
for the city for the people who live in
the city so it's another reason to build
a dam
so there's a lot of different reasons
for dam building
okay negative
negative is something that is harmful
unpleasant
or bad what is the opposite of negative
of course the opposite of negative is
positive so if you're talking about
something and you're describing it
you can talk about the negative side
of something those are the harmful or
bad
unpleasant things or aspects
about a a person a place
a thing an object or on the other hand
you could talk about the positive things
and those are the
the the good things the the pleasant
things
the nice things that people like about
something
so negative positive they are opposite
okay pesticide
a pesticide now this is an interesting
word okay pesticide
pest if i don't know if you know this
what is a pest
a pest is something that bothers you
and of course insects bother people
are you trying to sleep there's a
mosquito buzzing around your head right
that's a pest
right or if you're walking through the
uh
the forest and you get insects on your
legs that are on your feet
or on your ankles that might bite you
right those you don't like those that's
bothering you that's a pest now what
does
side mean sai means to kill right
so side for example homicide
is uh the act of killing another person
a human being
a suicide is killing oneself genocide is
killing a whole
race of people or whole group of people
so side
means death or killing so basically this
means killing insects right
pesticide is a noun and it's a chemical
but it's actually a chemical it's a
poison because it's a type of chemical
that can kill living
organisms so pesticide is a poison that
is used
to kill right side to kill
insects pests that damage
crops so farmers will use pesticides
to kill the insects and that is of
course to prevent the insects from
eating
all of their crops right so of course
when the farmer goes through all this
work to grow crops whether it's corn
uh broccoli apples whatever they're
growing
this is a great food source for insects
to move in and eat all the food
right of course farmers don't want that
so they spray their crops with pesticide
and that will kill the insects and
prevent them from eating
all of their fruit however there are
some negative sides
to pesticides too so we have positive
you know we just talked about negative
and positive
so there are positive aspects to
pesticides there are als
are also of course negative aspects to
pesticides
as well so it's very important to
balance these two
okay so anyway that's pesticide and that
is our words
those are our words for today's lesson
let's talk about the two main ideas of
this lesson and the first main idea
is changing the environment right we
said how do humans
how do we change the environment there
are many different ways
first one way is that builders dig
beneath the earth to make tunnels so
that's one way to change the environment
a very famous tunnel
is the tunnel that connects england
britain
to france it's called the chunnel
because it goes under the channel
so it's a channel tunnel tunnel
okay so uh it's a it's a very famous
tunnel
that connects the two countries used to
be you know these
england britain is an island you can't
ride a horse or drive a car
from england to france you have to use
a boat or ship but now you don't you can
drive you can
there's a train also that runs through
the tunnel so diggers
dig beneath the earth to make tunnels
what's another way builders again we're
using builders in both of these because
they're building they're not just
building buildings they're building
a massive construction projects a tunnel
is not really a building but it is a
massive construction project
a dam is kind of like a building but
people don't live in it or work in it
but it's still a type of construction
it's it's a huge construction project
and actually this does look a little bit
like the hoover dam
i'm not sure but it kind of looks like
that it's the same
kind of area with the desert rock okay
but anyway builders
create dams to make electricity as i
explained with the hydroelectric dams
and finally we have farmers farmers use
pesticide
to have more crops they kill the insects
the insects can't eat the crops
so that means we have more crops for
ourselves and the farmers don't have to
work as much to get the same amount of
food
so we talked about negative and the
opposite of negative is
positive right so positive positive
are things that are good that we like
that we
want to have those are positive things
and when we think about these three ways
that we change the environment
there are positive effects and there are
negative
effects with everything really
positive positive what is the positive
things about these three types
of changing our environment well they
can make our lives better right
we don't have to get on a boat to go
from britain to france we can just drive
it's very easy
we don't have to have the added expense
of building a boat
or running a trans uh a transportation
company
over water so it's much easier we don't
have to go over the mountain
we can just go under the mountain or
through the mountain
we can make electricity cheaply and
without polluting the environment
with a hydroelectric dam with a
pesticide we have more food so these are
all positive effects
however there are also negative effects
right the negative effects are that they
can hurt the environment
right when you dig up a lot of earth and
you um
build a lot of or you you use a lot of
steel and metal
of course you have to impact the
environment in a negative way
when you create a dam all the land
that was before the dam that was
nice land is now under water it's gone
and downstream uh you know it may affect
uh the downstream down the river as well
and animals that live in that river well
now all of a sudden they can't move
from the upper part to the lower part of
the river so
those are negative effects pesticides
like i said they don't just kill
insects they kill birds and they're
harmful to other animals as well
so those are negative effects of
pesticides so everything has a positive
side
and a negative side
now the second idea is we're talking
about rachel
carson you may not have heard of her she
was a very but she's very famous
environmentalist and why is she famous
because she wrote a book
called silent spring she was a scientist
she was also a writer she wrote a famous
book called
silent spring
and what she did was she took a look at
the use of pesticides
that farmers were using in their fields
and she studied this
and she realized that these pesticides
are
killing other animals especially birds
the reason her book is called silent
spring
is because the idea is that these
pesticides were killing off
many types of birds and if it we
continued to use the pesticides
the birds would all die out and we
wouldn't hear their song
in the spring about in the springtime
you hear a lot of birds chirping
and singing different songs or making
different noises
but if we kept using pesticides all the
birds die
spring would be silent because of the
book
new laws were made to protect nature her
book had a very
important effect on at least
in america that the american government
passed
strict laws about the use of pesticides
and one pesticide i think was called
ddt which was very strong and very
powerful
it was banned so farmers cannot use it
anymore and farmers of course have to
regulate
their use of pesticide is now regulated
by a government
agency and so that's a good thing
of course pesticides are helpful they
help feed a lot of people
it protects a lot of people from dying
of starvation but
overuse can be harmful so with
everything you know we have a positive
effect and a negative effect
we should balance those right make sure
that we have some kind of
regulations or laws in place to make
sure that the negative effects
don't outweigh the positive effects
okay interesting okay now it's time to
take a look at the reading
so as usual read along in your mind with
me or read along
out loud practice the pronunciation and
focus on the key vocabulary that we're
learning
in this lesson are you guys ready let's
begin
people change their environment to make
their lives better
there are many ways in which people
change
their environment farmers
for example plow the land before
planting seeds they use machines
to harvest crops which can affect
the environment in many ways
builders dig beneath the earth
to make tunnels through mountains
and underground they also
create large dams to make
electricity such dams change the water
flow
of a river or stream
to make it easier to cross rivers
people build bridges which can change
the environment
of a river in many different ways
changing our environment makes our lives
better
but we should be careful
changing the environment can have
negative effects
on nature
we can have more crops by using
pesticides
but using too much pesticide
can kill animals plants and
even humans okay let's talk about how
this reading
passage was organized how is the
information
organized in the reading passage and
here we have a very common way to
organize
information in a written piece and that
is you have a main idea
and then details the main idea is like
the topic sentence it's the sentence
that you say
at the beginning and then you support it
with details or examples
in this case we have the main idea is
people beep
their environment to make their lives
better of course this whole lesson is
about
how people change their environment
change their environment to make
their lives better and by the way change
is a neutral word
so this sentence is neutral it's not
positive it's not negative
if we wanted a positive statement we
would say people
improve their environment to make their
lives better and that would be
argumentative
right change when you say people change
their environment to make their lives
better
that's just description right you could
also do negative by the way
people destroy their environment in an
attempt
to make their lives better so you could
have a positive or
negative statement but that's more of an
argumentative passage
this one is just a neutral people change
their environment so it's more
descriptive
interesting okay so people change their
environment that's the main idea
what are the details then we have three
main details
to support that idea first of all we
have
farmers beep the earth before planting
seeds
well we talked about this word farmers
plow
the earth and of course plough can be a
verb
or a noun they use a plow to plow the
earth
right they use beep to harvest
crops well actually it's the same thing
that they use to plow the earth
as they use to harvest the crops and in
the passage we saw that it was machines
so they use they of course farmers they
use machines
to harvest crops they also use machines
to plow the field
in the next detail we go to a different
group we talk about builders
builders dig the earth to make tunnels
they also
create beep to make electricity now we
talked about this quite a bit
of course we know the word is dams and
we have to have it plural
dams s because they don't just build one
dam right it's builders and we're
talking about all over the world so
there's many dams
they also create dams to make
electricity
hydroelectric dams finally
our last detail for this chart is to
make it easier to cross rivers people
build
beep so what do they build of course you
could say tunnels here
you could say that and that's possible
i'm thinking about a famous tunnel in
new york
that goes under i think it's the hudson
river i'm not sure or is it
yeah i'm not sure but it's a lincoln
tunnel and it connects jersey to
manhattan
and it goes under the river but in the
passage
they talked about bridges bridges are
easier and more common right it's a lot
easier to build a bridge than it is to
dig a tunnel
so to make it easier to cross rivers
people build bridges
and all of these things change the
environment
in an attempt to make people's lives
better so all these details support the
main
topic sentence or the main idea
okay well that about wraps it up for
this lesson as we can see
uh we're all talking about different
ways that human beings
change their environment to hopefully
improve their lives
and as we can see in this unit
there are positive effects and negative
effects so that that's an important
thing to remember
we all want to change our environment we
want to make our lives better but we
have to be careful
that the positive change that we're
looking for
doesn't cause negative side effects
that may destroy the positive effects
right that the negative effects are not
greater than
the positive outcomes that we desire
okay well then actually this wraps up
the entire book right this is the last
lesson of the book
so i hope you learned a lot with me
studying these different lessons and
a lot of new vocabulary a lot of ideas
about the people
and the world around us i think one of
the main ideas
from the book that we can take from many
of these lessons is that we all
work together to try to improve our
lives we all want to live happier more
productive lives and it's important
to not only take care of ourselves but
also to
take care of the people around us
respect each other
uh work hard to improve your life but
also be careful about the positive
and negative effects of what you're
doing that kind of wraps up this lesson
kind of wraps up the book as well
so thank you very much for studying with
me i hope to see you in the next book
okay take care everybody bye bye

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading
00:11
we're on social studies book three in
00:14
the final lesson of the book lesson 15
00:17
wow time really goes by fast in lesson
00:20
15
00:21
we're talking about how we we
00:24
as humans we change our environment
00:28
so we will discover in this lesson how
00:31
humans
00:32
change the environment and also who
00:35
rachel carson was
00:38
interesting okay let's get started
00:41
okay the first word in the vocabulary is
00:45
plow p and l
00:48
together plow
00:51
so p and then l sound your tongue is
00:55
on the roof of your mouth behind your
00:57
front teeth la
00:58
plow plow to plow
01:02
is it's a verb so it means to
01:05
turn over a field it doesn't mean of
01:07
course to take the whole field and turn
01:08
it over
01:09
it means to take the dirt or the soil
01:13
in the field and with an instrument like
01:16
a hoe
01:16
and bring the dirt that's on the bottom
01:20
to the top and that's called turning
01:22
over a field
01:24
or land with a farming tool now i
01:27
mentioned a hoe but of course there are
01:29
many different ways to do it you can do
01:30
it by hand
01:32
which is very difficult takes a long
01:34
time
01:35
of course people used horses donkeys
01:39
cows oxes but nowadays of course people
01:42
use machinery and that's the picture
01:44
that we see
01:44
and as you can see you have one two
01:47
three four
01:48
four pieces of metal digging into the
01:50
earth so that does the work
01:52
of four people or four horses at one
01:55
time
01:55
so of course machinery has made our
01:57
lives a lot easier
01:59
and has made work much more efficient so
02:02
to plow a field is to turn over the land
02:04
why do farmers do that
02:06
because what they're trying to do is
02:08
they're trying to
02:09
get the soil that's underneath the
02:11
ground up on the surface
02:13
and also to help uh get air into the uh
02:16
the soil to break it up so that the
02:18
land will absorb water more easily and
02:21
of course these are good conditions for
02:22
growing plants
02:24
basically they're preparing the land to
02:26
make it
02:28
more suitable for growing plants
02:31
so that the plants will grow faster and
02:34
better and healthier
02:35
okay next we have harvest
02:38
so you plow the field in the spring
02:41
right in the springtime the
02:42
farmers are out plowing the land and
02:44
then they plant the seeds of course
02:46
over the summer time those plants will
02:48
grow in the fall
02:50
it's time to harvest now harvest can be
02:53
a noun
02:53
or a verb in this case it's a verb to
02:56
harvest means
02:57
to collect the crops so after the plants
03:00
have grown
03:01
and they have produced fruit or
03:03
vegetables or whatever it is the farmers
03:05
are growing
03:06
in the fall it's time to go out and
03:09
gather all those crops
03:10
to send it to the supermarket so to
03:13
collect crops or
03:15
plants from the fields and hopefully
03:17
farmers
03:18
look forward to a good
03:21
harvest and thanksgiving in the fall
03:24
is a celebration of hopefully a good
03:27
harvest okay it's a way to celebrate oh
03:29
good we
03:30
we you know we the planting season is
03:33
over
03:33
we've harvest all the food let's have a
03:35
big feast to celebrate that many
03:37
thanksgivings are like that
03:39
but they celebrate the harvest in that
03:41
case the harvest is a noun
03:43
so harvest can be noun or it can be verb
03:46
okay
03:48
builder a builder is a person
03:51
that builds very easy right we have er
03:55
many words have er it means a person who
03:57
does
03:58
the action indicated in the root
04:01
of the word in this case to build build
04:04
builder right at a at a restaurant
04:08
you know if you wait if your job is to
04:10
wait for the customer
04:11
you are a waiter or waitress right so er
04:15
we add it to to designate that that's a
04:18
person
04:18
who does that thing not always but it's
04:20
a very common pattern in english
04:22
so a builder is a person that makes
04:24
buildings
04:25
right in this case this gentleman here
04:27
he is making a brick wall he is putting
04:30
he is uh putting bricks together to make
04:32
a brick wall to
04:33
make a building okay so that's a builder
04:37
dig and of course you can say digger
04:39
right this person is a digger
04:41
right but here we just have the verb
04:43
right dig
04:45
to dig to dig means to make a hole
04:48
in soil soil dirt the ground
04:51
with a tool or hands oh
04:54
don't do that you'll get all dirt all
04:56
over your hands and under your
04:58
fingernails but you'll notice that dogs
05:00
like to dig holes not with their hands
05:02
of course with their paws but it's like
05:04
their hands but we call them paws
05:06
p-a-w-s
05:08
p-a-w-s but they're still digging right
05:11
dogs don't use a tool they're not out
05:12
there with a shovel right
05:14
they're using their their paws to dig a
05:16
hole so
05:17
any time that uh a person or an animal
05:21
creates a hole in the ground that verb
05:24
is called to dig
05:25
and some animals are very good at
05:27
digging right they make their homes
05:29
underground okay so that's to dig
05:33
tunnel now a tunnel if you dig deep
05:36
enough and you go down and then you go
05:38
you go not down but you go across right
05:41
or maybe you dig
05:42
through a mountain especially in this
05:44
case right
05:45
there's a town here in a town here and
05:47
there's a mountain in between
05:49
well people will dig a tunnel through
05:51
the mountain of course a tunnel
05:53
is just an underground path that is made
05:56
through a mountain or a hill
06:00
also it could also be under some
06:03
other geological feature like uh
06:06
uh water for example there's a very
06:09
famous tunnel
06:10
between britain and france and that goes
06:13
under the channel
06:14
of the british channel or the english
06:15
channel and basically that's a tunnel
06:17
that they dug that
06:18
had to go down right to go under the
06:20
water and it comes you know it goes down
06:22
in britain
06:22
and it comes back up in france or goes
06:25
down in france and
06:26
comes up in england so that is of
06:29
another famous tunnel right so it's any
06:31
underground path that is made through a
06:33
mountain
06:34
a hill or even under water or even
06:37
under the city many of your if you live
06:39
in a large city you might have a subway
06:41
system
06:42
and the subway tunnels are under the
06:44
city so
06:46
any underground path okay whether it's
06:48
for
06:49
you know an animal right animals dig
06:52
tunnels
06:52
a person a walking tunnel a cars or even
06:56
trains
06:56
subways whatever they're all we all call
06:59
those
07:00
tunnels okay
07:03
damn dam is another uh very huge
07:07
project an engineering project that
07:09
people will build
07:10
builders will build and a dam is a kind
07:13
of wall
07:14
and as you can see it's a wall that uh
07:17
holds
07:17
water back so it's a wall that
07:21
uh that prevents water
07:24
from flowing naturally now of course
07:27
water is allowed
07:28
to flow through the dam and in fact
07:31
that's a very good way
07:32
to collect that energy that would be a
07:35
hydroelectric
07:36
dam high dro hydro by the way means
07:40
water and electric of course you know
07:42
electric
07:43
electricity elec oops electric yeah i'm
07:47
gonna
07:47
pay more attention to spelling and a
07:49
little less attention to talking
07:52
hydroelectric so hydro means electricity
07:56
from water
07:56
right hydro means water right
08:00
so this is a good way many dams are
08:02
hydroelectric dams
08:04
they take that energy from the flowing
08:05
water and they convert that
08:07
uh energy into electricity which is
08:09
another form of
08:10
energy so a dam is a kind of wall that
08:13
is built across a river of course
08:16
you know you build it across the river
08:17
to prevent water from
08:19
flowing of course it doesn't prevent
08:22
you're not saying okay you don't want
08:24
any water to flow you do
08:26
want water to flow but what dams do
08:28
usually
08:29
is to regulate that water
08:32
so for example you might live in an area
08:34
where there's a lot of rain
08:35
and every year it might flood downstream
08:38
but if you build a dam there
08:39
then you can control the amount of water
08:42
and make sure the amount of water that's
08:43
flowing on the dam
08:44
is the same all year round no matter
08:48
what the weather conditions are
08:49
so that's one reason why people build
08:51
dams another reason why people build
08:53
dams is because they want to have a
08:55
supply
08:56
of fresh water for a nearby city for
08:58
example
08:59
um hoover dam this isn't hoover dam
09:04
no that's not hoover dam but there's a
09:05
famous hoover dam near las vegas in
09:08
nevada
09:08
and of course las vegas
09:12
uses a lot of the water that is dammed
09:15
up there
09:15
for the city for the people who live in
09:17
the city so it's another reason to build
09:19
a dam
09:19
so there's a lot of different reasons
09:21
for dam building
09:23
okay negative
09:26
negative is something that is harmful
09:28
unpleasant
09:29
or bad what is the opposite of negative
09:33
of course the opposite of negative is
09:36
positive so if you're talking about
09:39
something and you're describing it
09:41
you can talk about the negative side
09:44
of something those are the harmful or
09:47
bad
09:48
unpleasant things or aspects
09:51
about a a person a place
09:54
a thing an object or on the other hand
09:57
you could talk about the positive things
09:59
and those are the
10:00
the the good things the the pleasant
10:02
things
10:03
the nice things that people like about
10:06
something
10:07
so negative positive they are opposite
10:11
okay pesticide
10:14
a pesticide now this is an interesting
10:16
word okay pesticide
10:17
pest if i don't know if you know this
10:20
what is a pest
10:21
a pest is something that bothers you
10:24
and of course insects bother people
10:28
are you trying to sleep there's a
10:29
mosquito buzzing around your head right
10:31
that's a pest
10:32
right or if you're walking through the
10:35
uh
10:35
the forest and you get insects on your
10:37
legs that are on your feet
10:39
or on your ankles that might bite you
10:41
right those you don't like those that's
10:43
bothering you that's a pest now what
10:46
does
10:46
side mean sai means to kill right
10:52
so side for example homicide
10:55
is uh the act of killing another person
10:58
a human being
10:59
a suicide is killing oneself genocide is
11:03
killing a whole
11:04
race of people or whole group of people
11:06
so side
11:07
means death or killing so basically this
11:11
means killing insects right
11:12
pesticide is a noun and it's a chemical
11:16
but it's actually a chemical it's a
11:18
poison because it's a type of chemical
11:20
that can kill living
11:24
organisms so pesticide is a poison that
11:27
is used
11:28
to kill right side to kill
11:31
insects pests that damage
11:34
crops so farmers will use pesticides
11:37
to kill the insects and that is of
11:39
course to prevent the insects from
11:41
eating
11:42
all of their crops right so of course
11:44
when the farmer goes through all this
11:46
work to grow crops whether it's corn
11:48
uh broccoli apples whatever they're
11:51
growing
11:53
this is a great food source for insects
11:55
to move in and eat all the food
11:57
right of course farmers don't want that
11:59
so they spray their crops with pesticide
12:01
and that will kill the insects and
12:03
prevent them from eating
12:04
all of their fruit however there are
12:06
some negative sides
12:08
to pesticides too so we have positive
12:10
you know we just talked about negative
12:11
and positive
12:12
so there are positive aspects to
12:14
pesticides there are als
12:16
are also of course negative aspects to
12:18
pesticides
12:19
as well so it's very important to
12:21
balance these two
12:22
okay so anyway that's pesticide and that
12:25
is our words
12:26
those are our words for today's lesson
12:30
let's talk about the two main ideas of
12:32
this lesson and the first main idea
12:34
is changing the environment right we
12:36
said how do humans
12:37
how do we change the environment there
12:40
are many different ways
12:42
first one way is that builders dig
12:46
beneath the earth to make tunnels so
12:48
that's one way to change the environment
12:50
a very famous tunnel
12:52
is the tunnel that connects england
12:54
britain
12:55
to france it's called the chunnel
12:58
because it goes under the channel
13:00
so it's a channel tunnel tunnel
13:03
okay so uh it's a it's a very famous
13:06
tunnel
13:06
that connects the two countries used to
13:08
be you know these
13:09
england britain is an island you can't
13:12
ride a horse or drive a car
13:14
from england to france you have to use
13:17
a boat or ship but now you don't you can
13:20
drive you can
13:21
there's a train also that runs through
13:23
the tunnel so diggers
13:24
dig beneath the earth to make tunnels
13:27
what's another way builders again we're
13:30
using builders in both of these because
13:32
they're building they're not just
13:33
building buildings they're building
13:35
a massive construction projects a tunnel
13:38
is not really a building but it is a
13:40
massive construction project
13:42
a dam is kind of like a building but
13:44
people don't live in it or work in it
13:46
but it's still a type of construction
13:48
it's it's a huge construction project
13:50
and actually this does look a little bit
13:52
like the hoover dam
13:54
i'm not sure but it kind of looks like
13:56
that it's the same
13:57
kind of area with the desert rock okay
13:59
but anyway builders
14:00
create dams to make electricity as i
14:03
explained with the hydroelectric dams
14:06
and finally we have farmers farmers use
14:08
pesticide
14:09
to have more crops they kill the insects
14:12
the insects can't eat the crops
14:15
so that means we have more crops for
14:16
ourselves and the farmers don't have to
14:18
work as much to get the same amount of
14:20
food
14:22
so we talked about negative and the
14:24
opposite of negative is
14:26
positive right so positive positive
14:30
are things that are good that we like
14:33
that we
14:34
want to have those are positive things
14:37
and when we think about these three ways
14:39
that we change the environment
14:40
there are positive effects and there are
14:43
negative
14:44
effects with everything really
14:47
positive positive what is the positive
14:50
things about these three types
14:52
of changing our environment well they
14:54
can make our lives better right
14:56
we don't have to get on a boat to go
14:58
from britain to france we can just drive
15:00
it's very easy
15:01
we don't have to have the added expense
15:03
of building a boat
15:04
or running a trans uh a transportation
15:08
company
15:08
over water so it's much easier we don't
15:10
have to go over the mountain
15:12
we can just go under the mountain or
15:13
through the mountain
15:15
we can make electricity cheaply and
15:18
without polluting the environment
15:20
with a hydroelectric dam with a
15:22
pesticide we have more food so these are
15:24
all positive effects
15:26
however there are also negative effects
15:29
right the negative effects are that they
15:32
can hurt the environment
15:34
right when you dig up a lot of earth and
15:36
you um
15:39
build a lot of or you you use a lot of
15:41
steel and metal
15:42
of course you have to impact the
15:44
environment in a negative way
15:46
when you create a dam all the land
15:50
that was before the dam that was
15:54
nice land is now under water it's gone
15:58
and downstream uh you know it may affect
16:01
uh the downstream down the river as well
16:04
and animals that live in that river well
16:06
now all of a sudden they can't move
16:08
from the upper part to the lower part of
16:09
the river so
16:11
those are negative effects pesticides
16:13
like i said they don't just kill
16:14
insects they kill birds and they're
16:16
harmful to other animals as well
16:17
so those are negative effects of
16:19
pesticides so everything has a positive
16:21
side
16:22
and a negative side
16:26
now the second idea is we're talking
16:28
about rachel
16:29
carson you may not have heard of her she
16:32
was a very but she's very famous
16:34
environmentalist and why is she famous
16:37
because she wrote a book
16:38
called silent spring she was a scientist
16:42
she was also a writer she wrote a famous
16:44
book called
16:45
silent spring
16:48
and what she did was she took a look at
16:50
the use of pesticides
16:52
that farmers were using in their fields
16:55
and she studied this
16:56
and she realized that these pesticides
16:59
are
17:00
killing other animals especially birds
17:02
the reason her book is called silent
17:04
spring
17:05
is because the idea is that these
17:07
pesticides were killing off
17:09
many types of birds and if it we
17:12
continued to use the pesticides
17:14
the birds would all die out and we
17:16
wouldn't hear their song
17:18
in the spring about in the springtime
17:19
you hear a lot of birds chirping
17:21
and singing different songs or making
17:24
different noises
17:25
but if we kept using pesticides all the
17:27
birds die
17:29
spring would be silent because of the
17:32
book
17:32
new laws were made to protect nature her
17:35
book had a very
17:36
important effect on at least
17:39
in america that the american government
17:42
passed
17:42
strict laws about the use of pesticides
17:45
and one pesticide i think was called
17:47
ddt which was very strong and very
17:50
powerful
17:51
it was banned so farmers cannot use it
17:54
anymore and farmers of course have to
17:56
regulate
17:57
their use of pesticide is now regulated
17:59
by a government
18:00
agency and so that's a good thing
18:04
of course pesticides are helpful they
18:06
help feed a lot of people
18:08
it protects a lot of people from dying
18:09
of starvation but
18:11
overuse can be harmful so with
18:13
everything you know we have a positive
18:15
effect and a negative effect
18:16
we should balance those right make sure
18:18
that we have some kind of
18:20
regulations or laws in place to make
18:23
sure that the negative effects
18:25
don't outweigh the positive effects
18:28
okay interesting okay now it's time to
18:31
take a look at the reading
18:32
so as usual read along in your mind with
18:36
me or read along
18:37
out loud practice the pronunciation and
18:39
focus on the key vocabulary that we're
18:42
learning
18:42
in this lesson are you guys ready let's
18:44
begin
18:46
people change their environment to make
18:49
their lives better
18:51
there are many ways in which people
18:53
change
18:54
their environment farmers
18:58
for example plow the land before
19:01
planting seeds they use machines
19:05
to harvest crops which can affect
19:08
the environment in many ways
19:13
builders dig beneath the earth
19:17
to make tunnels through mountains
19:20
and underground they also
19:24
create large dams to make
19:27
electricity such dams change the water
19:31
flow
19:32
of a river or stream
19:37
to make it easier to cross rivers
19:40
people build bridges which can change
19:43
the environment
19:44
of a river in many different ways
19:50
changing our environment makes our lives
19:53
better
19:54
but we should be careful
19:57
changing the environment can have
20:00
negative effects
20:01
on nature
20:05
we can have more crops by using
20:07
pesticides
20:09
but using too much pesticide
20:12
can kill animals plants and
20:15
even humans okay let's talk about how
20:19
this reading
20:20
passage was organized how is the
20:22
information
20:23
organized in the reading passage and
20:25
here we have a very common way to
20:27
organize
20:27
information in a written piece and that
20:30
is you have a main idea
20:32
and then details the main idea is like
20:33
the topic sentence it's the sentence
20:35
that you say
20:36
at the beginning and then you support it
20:38
with details or examples
20:40
in this case we have the main idea is
20:42
people beep
20:44
their environment to make their lives
20:45
better of course this whole lesson is
20:47
about
20:48
how people change their environment
20:51
change their environment to make
20:54
their lives better and by the way change
20:57
is a neutral word
20:58
so this sentence is neutral it's not
21:00
positive it's not negative
21:02
if we wanted a positive statement we
21:04
would say people
21:05
improve their environment to make their
21:07
lives better and that would be
21:09
argumentative
21:10
right change when you say people change
21:12
their environment to make their lives
21:14
better
21:15
that's just description right you could
21:17
also do negative by the way
21:19
people destroy their environment in an
21:21
attempt
21:22
to make their lives better so you could
21:24
have a positive or
21:26
negative statement but that's more of an
21:28
argumentative passage
21:30
this one is just a neutral people change
21:32
their environment so it's more
21:33
descriptive
21:35
interesting okay so people change their
21:36
environment that's the main idea
21:38
what are the details then we have three
21:40
main details
21:42
to support that idea first of all we
21:44
have
21:45
farmers beep the earth before planting
21:48
seeds
21:49
well we talked about this word farmers
21:51
plow
21:52
the earth and of course plough can be a
21:55
verb
21:55
or a noun they use a plow to plow the
21:58
earth
21:58
right they use beep to harvest
22:01
crops well actually it's the same thing
22:04
that they use to plow the earth
22:06
as they use to harvest the crops and in
22:08
the passage we saw that it was machines
22:13
so they use they of course farmers they
22:16
use machines
22:17
to harvest crops they also use machines
22:20
to plow the field
22:22
in the next detail we go to a different
22:24
group we talk about builders
22:26
builders dig the earth to make tunnels
22:29
they also
22:30
create beep to make electricity now we
22:33
talked about this quite a bit
22:34
of course we know the word is dams and
22:37
we have to have it plural
22:39
dams s because they don't just build one
22:41
dam right it's builders and we're
22:43
talking about all over the world so
22:44
there's many dams
22:45
they also create dams to make
22:48
electricity
22:49
hydroelectric dams finally
22:52
our last detail for this chart is to
22:55
make it easier to cross rivers people
22:57
build
22:57
beep so what do they build of course you
23:00
could say tunnels here
23:01
you could say that and that's possible
23:03
i'm thinking about a famous tunnel in
23:04
new york
23:05
that goes under i think it's the hudson
23:07
river i'm not sure or is it
23:08
yeah i'm not sure but it's a lincoln
23:10
tunnel and it connects jersey to
23:12
manhattan
23:13
and it goes under the river but in the
23:15
passage
23:16
they talked about bridges bridges are
23:18
easier and more common right it's a lot
23:20
easier to build a bridge than it is to
23:23
dig a tunnel
23:24
so to make it easier to cross rivers
23:26
people build bridges
23:28
and all of these things change the
23:30
environment
23:31
in an attempt to make people's lives
23:33
better so all these details support the
23:35
main
23:36
topic sentence or the main idea
23:39
okay well that about wraps it up for
23:41
this lesson as we can see
23:42
uh we're all talking about different
23:45
ways that human beings
23:47
change their environment to hopefully
23:49
improve their lives
23:51
and as we can see in this unit
23:54
there are positive effects and negative
23:56
effects so that that's an important
23:57
thing to remember
23:59
we all want to change our environment we
24:01
want to make our lives better but we
24:02
have to be careful
24:03
that the positive change that we're
24:05
looking for
24:06
doesn't cause negative side effects
24:09
that may destroy the positive effects
24:12
right that the negative effects are not
24:13
greater than
24:14
the positive outcomes that we desire
24:18
okay well then actually this wraps up
24:20
the entire book right this is the last
24:22
lesson of the book
24:23
so i hope you learned a lot with me
24:25
studying these different lessons and
24:27
a lot of new vocabulary a lot of ideas
24:29
about the people
24:31
and the world around us i think one of
24:33
the main ideas
24:34
from the book that we can take from many
24:35
of these lessons is that we all
24:37
work together to try to improve our
24:40
lives we all want to live happier more
24:41
productive lives and it's important
24:44
to not only take care of ourselves but
24:46
also to
24:47
take care of the people around us
24:48
respect each other
24:50
uh work hard to improve your life but
24:53
also be careful about the positive
24:55
and negative effects of what you're
24:57
doing that kind of wraps up this lesson
24:59
kind of wraps up the book as well
25:01

25:03
