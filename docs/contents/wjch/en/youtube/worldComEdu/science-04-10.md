hello everybody
and welcome back to american textbook
reading i'm brian stewart
and in this lesson we're taking a look
at science book 4
lesson 10 the moon planets
and stars so we're leaving earth
okay so in this unit we will discover
phases
of the moon and we will also discover
what
the solar system is
and you'll notice this picture here i
believe it's in your book
and i'm going to talk about something
here but notice this
pluto we'll talk about that in the
lesson okay
first word in our vocabulary is shine
shine means to reflect or to send
out light what's the difference reflect
means
if you have an object and it doesn't
give light off right but this is a black
surface so it's not very good
so let's say it's a shiny surface right
and the light hits it and the light
coming from another source hits it and
bounces back to you
that's reflect but
if the object oh now the object
is sending out light okay so in both
cases they shine
right whether the object is sending out
light or if it's just reflecting
in both cases they shine because
you can see the light that is coming
from them whether the light is
generated there or if it's just being
reflected
off of that object okay so to shine
ring i have a ring okay
a ring of course is a circular uh
shape and there's a hole in the middle
of course
so you can put your finger around it or
inside of it
but of course in this case we have a
planet
inside of a ring a ring is the small
pieces of matter
that circle a planet what famous planet
in
our solar system has a ring actually
there are a few
planets but the most famous one is
saturn saturn has a very amazing and
colorful
ring around it and it really puzzled
early astronomers who looked at it in a
telescope like what is that thing does
it have ears
what's going on so finally they figured
out it's a ring and it's just small
pieces of
rocks and ice that are circling the
planet
just like the moon circles our planet
except imagine the moon is broken up
into tiny little pieces
and makes our ring all the way around
the planet
okay phase we saw that word
in the introduction to this lesson and
what what is phase
a phase is the change in the changes
in the shape of the moon as seen by us
of course
if you go out at night and you look at
the moon sometimes it's a perfect
white circle shining in the sky
it's not giving off light it's
reflecting light from the sun
but still shining right and sometimes
you go out at night
and the moon is just a little sliver of
light
now the changes you know when it goes
from a full circle of light to no light
and then comes back we call those the
phases
of the moon it looks like the moon is
changing
shape not really it's just the the way
that the light is reflecting off the
moon
so the changes in the shape of the moon
as seen by
us because we're on earth right if we
were in outer space in the spacecraft
maybe we wouldn't see these changes
depends on where we are okay
telescope a telescope now this is a very
expensive telescope not many people have
one of these
but you can buy a cheaper telescope
that can enable you to see
really far away so if your friend is
on the other side of a very big parking
lot from you
you can look at the telescope and they
seem very big in the telescope
but of course you can look at the stars
and at the sky with the telescope
there's a very powerful telescope
which astronomers use to study
things that are very very very
very very far away in the night sky
so a device that makes things far away
look bigger okay
next we have constellation
that's a little difficult pronunciation
right con sta
lei shun so four syllables constellation
constellation is a group of stars a
group of stars
which form a pattern and have a name
thousands of years ago our
ancestors looked up in the sky
and they saw these lights shining
in the black of the sky and
as they looked they said hey wait a
minute those stars over there though
there's point they didn't know they were
stars
those lights look like a shape
right what is that shape and and their
imagination said oh that looks like a
lion
that looks like a hunter that looks like
a scorpion
right and so these shapes they gave them
names
right a leo orion scorpio
they gave these groups of patterns these
groups of lights in the sky they
patterned them in their mind
and they gave them names to represent
mythical or legendary characters or
creatures in their stories
in their myths and in their legends and
so we have a lot of different
types of constellations and you can see
them here
and many of them of course have names
and different cultures
might have different names for them now
of course that's just how we
see them from earth if you moved to
another star system
it would all be different all right okay
or if you move to another place in the
galaxy
all these uh constellations would change
it's only from our perspective on earth
that we see these shapes
now we have solar system the sun and
all the planets that go around it so of
course we have the sun here and you can
see the
orbits of all the planets we have
mercury venus earth mars
jupiter saturn uranus uranus some
people call it uranus okay neptune
and then we have pluto and i said before
wait a minute
that's an interesting point because
nowadays
astronomers do not regard pluto as a
planet
okay we'll see that in the in the next
section we'll talk about the different
planets
of the solar system so i'll touch upon
that
point soon okay one of the main ideas
in this unit is the phases of the moon
and as i said before
we see the moon in different shapes
depending on where the moon is in the
sky
in relation to the sun and of course to
our position
on earth so we have these what we call
new moon it's not a new moon it's been
there for billions of years
okay it's not new but it looks like it's
new because well we can't see it it's
it's black and why is it black because
imagine that the sun
okay on this picture it looks like well
okay imagine that the sun is over here
okay
so if the sun is over here it's shining
light at the earth
all the it's it's making this part of
the moon very bright
but we don't see any of that light if
you're up here you know
um you won't see the moon because all
the light is shining on the moon this
way
and the rest of the moon is dark
okay to us of course the moon is always
lit by the sun
but if we're here and the sun is here we
can't see the moon
but imagine if the moon is over here
right
and of course as long as the earth isn't
in the way of the sun
that would be an eclipse but that's
something different okay so if that's if
the moon
is over here on this side and the sun is
over here and of course it would be
night
on this part then we can see the moon in
all its glory
in very bright white and it's a circle
a perfect circle in the sky now if the
sun
is only shining part of the moon right
we can see only maybe
half of the moon and the same thing over
here because the moon has these
different cycles
as the moon orbits throughout the month
and the in the earth turns
and also orbits we see different
phases of the moon we don't see
different parts of them and we always
see the same part of the moon actually
that's another interesting point but
anyway we see
the different shadows or reflections
of the light on the moon so we have new
moon then we have the first
quarter moon so the moon uh we can see
like a quarter of the moon
quarter means one fourth right then we
can see the full moon
then we see the last quarter moon and
then it goes back to a new moon so
actually it looks like this diagram is
going this way
and as it says here the moon rotates
rotates means it orb well actually it
kind of
it it is rotating yes but it's also
orbiting
around the earth i would say it r orbits
i'm not sure
rotate is the best word here orbits
the moon orbits around the earth in
about 29 days that's a month
okay and that's interesting because
again a long time ago our ancestors
thousands of years ago of course they
watched the moon
and they divided the time of the year
into 12 different periods that they
called months
because that's about how many times the
earth will
go around the earth in the period
of one year so about 12 times
that the moon will rotate or orbit or
orbit is better word orbit around the
earth
in one year 12 times so divide the year
into 12
months it's not perfect right sometimes
we have to adjust it
but it's pretty pretty close okay and of
course we call talk about the phases of
the moon
whether it's a new moon you cannot see
the moon it's black so we can't see it
and then sometimes it grows slightly
it's a little bit you know one-eighth
and one-fourth then we can see half the
moon
then three quarters of the moon then a
full moon it's very bright
and you can walk around at night without
a flashlight
you can see because the moon's giving us
a lot of light
it's actually giving us the sunlight
reflecting off the moon
and then it turns back into the black
moon that we cannot see the reflection
of the sun off it anymore and that's
what happens during
the month okay next we have the solar
system now you can see here on this
picture
right we see mercury venus earth mars
jupiter saturn
uranus or uranus neptune where is pluto
pluto's gone okay we only have eight
planets
now that's interesting because when i
was growing up when i was a kid
we said there were nine planets but then
a very bad man
named dr neil degrasse tyson took pluto
away
no i'm just kidding i'm just kidding dr
tyson
is a very popular and entertaining
astronomer
and he jokes about this sometimes too
that people blame him
for uh the fact that astronomers no
longer
consider pluto as a planet but i have a
lot of respect
for dr tyson i really like him he's a
great
astronomer he's a great educator but
anyway uh
and of course it wasn't his decision
either it was it was a group of
astronomers
why did they do that because a long time
ago when pluto was discovered
the astronomers that discovered pluto by
looking through telescopes
they only saw pluto they didn't realize
that there were a lot of
other objects out there
and nowadays with better technology
and better tools astronomers have found
there are a lot of objects like pluto
out
way out on the edge of the solar system
and pluto is more like
them than pluto is like a planet
so that's why they said oh pluto really
shouldn't be considered as a planet
it's more like these other objects that
are out there so we no longer
count pluto as a planet don't blame dr
tyson i was just kidding
okay so anyway what are the planets
uh you probably learned these in school
mercury we think about mercury as the
first planet
because it's closest to the sun mercury
is a really
hot hellish place you could not live on
the surface of mercury because it's so
close to the sun
it is the closest planet to the sun it
is very very hot
on mercury and mercury goes around very
fast
that's why the greeks call mercury the
messenger of the gods
because it moves so quickly and of
course if you want to be the messenger
of the gods
you have to move very quickly so mercury
next in order in away from the sun
is venus now venus is an interesting
planet it's very similar to earth
but it is a hottest planet why is it
so hot because it's covered by thick
clouds of gas
astronomers sometimes think and you know
nobody can prove this they just imagine
they have
hypotheses and they think that venus may
have
been like earth a long long time ago
but as the atmosphere formed because it
was closer to the sun
there was a lot more heavy gases in the
atmosphere that formed
and the sun rays heated up the surface
of venus
and it's so hot okay next we have earth
i'm getting too
too much detail okay earth of course is
where we live
earth is in the perfect zone for life
not too close to the sun
not too far we have enough uh sunlight
warmth generated by the sun we also have
water liquid water on the surface and so
we have
life on earth earth has water air
and one moon okay mars has the largest
volcano it's a next
soul planted out as the largest volcano
and it has two moons but they're very
small
and they go around mars and mars is
smaller than the earth
the next planet out is jupiter jupiter
is the largest planet
with over 60 moons did you know that
jupiter has a lot of moons going around
it because it's so big and in fact
jupiter is so
big if it were a little bit bigger i'm
not sure how much bigger it could have
formed into a star
the gravitation could have made all that
matter collapse uh
ignite in in which is what the sun is
and we could have had two suns in our
solar system but then
could life have formed on earth if that
were the case we don't know but there
are cases where solar systems have two
stars
sometimes three stars circling around
each other okay anyway
the next planet out is saturn we talked
about it with the ring around it
the next one is uranus or some people
say
uranus uh because of certain jokes about
uranus
okay uh and it's a it's a big planet
it's also what we call a gas giant and
neptune is the same
it's also a giant now i'm going too fast
because this is
i could talk forever about this but
uranus has thin rings around it
so saturn isn't the only planet with
rings a uranus has
also thin rings around it neptune is a
blue planet it has
13 moons so there are a lot of different
moons around
these big planets jupiter saturn uranus
and neptune
they have also either moons or uranus
has thin rings around it but it's very
interesting astronomers are very
interested in
sending spaceships to these moons to see
what the conditions
are on those moons okay anyway
that's a lot again i could talk for a
very long time about this
read about it look on the internet check
it out there's some
fascinating things you can find out
about the different planets
in the solar system okay
let's do the reading okay in the reading
as usual i'll read it out loud you guys
repeat after me
or think about it in your mind okay
first of all
let's start with at night because that's
when we see the stars so let's begin
at night you can see many lights in the
sky
the moon rotates around the earth
in about 29 days it also rotates on its
axis about every 29 days
so the same side of the moon
always faces the earth
we never see the other side of the moon
interesting okay we always see the same
side
because as it's orbiting it's also
turning okay
so that's interesting we always see the
same side of the moon
the moon reflects light from the sun
as the moon orbits around the earth its
shape seems to change
these shapes are called the phases of
the moon
when you see the different shapes in
these pictures right this is a
crescent shape a crescent this is
half moon and full moon
full moon full moon half moon crescent
moon
crescent moon okay
the earth is one of the eight planets in
our solar system
not nine anymore just eight
jupiter is the largest planet
more than one thousand earths could fit
inside it jupiter has 62
moons wow that's a lot of moons
the planet saturn has a ring around it
you can see jupiter's moons and saturn's
i'm sorry you can see jupiter's moons
and saturn's ring with a
telescope many stars
shine in the night sky
stars are suns they are very very
far away we actually have to say very
very very very very very very
very far away okay
some stars have planets orbiting them
stars can make patterns in the sky which
are called
constellations constellations
okay very good that's the reading
passage
now how is the information in the
reading passage organized
here we have the classic or very common
organizational pattern of main idea and
then supporting details
so what is the main idea of this passage
the main idea is
the lights in the sky are the moon
planets and stars that's interesting i i
did want to mention that too because
the lights in the sky of course we know
what the moon is we can see it it's very
big
but many a long time ago many people
thought that planets
were also stars they didn't know the
difference
they just saw these lights moving around
jupiter looks like a star
in the night sky it wasn't until much
later when people had telescopes that
they could figure out and they also
studied the motion
they could figure hey these aren't stars
there are other planets
in our solar system okay so
what are the details that support this
main idea the lights in the sky are the
moon
planets and stars the first main detail
is
the moon planets and stars are all
lights that
beep in the sky and we talked about that
and i and i
mentioned that i used my cell phone as
an example right whether they're
reflecting the light
or they're giving the light off what do
they do
they shine
so are lights that shine in the sky
saturn is one of eight planets
in our beep what do we call the group of
planets
including earth our planet that orbit
the sun
we call that the solar system and it's
our solar system because we live here
solar system solar
system two words oops
that's right solar system so saturn is
one of eight planets in our solar
system saturn has a beep around it what
is it
of course it's a ring but it's not a
ring that you put on your finger
it's a ring that goes around a planet
okay saturn has a ring
around it which you can see with a what
with a telescope telescope
so if you go out and buy a telescope
and you have to get away from the city
so you can see there's no other light
around and then look at the night sky
and see what amazing things you can see
through your telescope okay next
some stars have beep orbiting them
so of course our star soul well that's
the name of our
son soul sol has
eight planets orbiting them now as we
look out to other stars astronomers
are able to detect other planets
so some stars have planets
orbiting them who lives there what lives
there
what are the planets like these are very
amazing or very mysterious questions
that we have
and someday of course they're very very
very far away it's very hard to get to
those
planets but it's a very interesting
question
okay stars can make patterns called
what we talked about this right the our
ancestors looked up in the sky and they
they made shapes according to their
stories their myths their legends
and they made uh the patterns they made
those groupings of the stars and we call
those
con
[Music]
lay shuns four syllables
constellations we call those patterns
constellations and those are interesting
also you can
check out books or charts on the
internet to find out what the different
constellations are
and what are the star the name of the
names of the stars
in those constellations and it's
interesting some of the stars in the
constellations
have actually blown up and they will
disappear
after hundreds thousands of years okay
so anyway uh this is a you know i'm
sorry if i went too long i
gave too much detail more than the
lesson has in the book
but this is really an interesting field
of study
and i encourage you to read more to read
books
about astronomy to go on the internet go
on the internet
check out just type in mars type in
saturn type in
the moons of jupiter and find out all
sorts of
interesting and amazing details about
the different
uh planets and moons that
are orbiting the same solar system that
we are in and also check out the
interesting questions that astronomers
have and what are astronomers nowadays
working on
what are they or what are their
questions and how are they going about
trying to find the answers to those
questions it's a very fascinating
and interesting subject and apologies to
dr tyson i was just joking
okay anyway thanks for studying with me
and we'll see you in the next lesson
take care everybody bye bye
[Music]
you

hello everybody
00:09
and welcome back to american textbook
00:11
reading i'm brian stewart
00:13
and in this lesson we're taking a look
00:15
at science book 4
00:17
lesson 10 the moon planets
00:21
and stars so we're leaving earth
00:24
okay so in this unit we will discover
00:27
phases
00:28
of the moon and we will also discover
00:31
what
00:31
the solar system is
00:34
and you'll notice this picture here i
00:37
believe it's in your book
00:38
and i'm going to talk about something
00:40
here but notice this
00:42
pluto we'll talk about that in the
00:44
lesson okay
00:47
first word in our vocabulary is shine
00:52
shine means to reflect or to send
00:55
out light what's the difference reflect
00:58
means
00:59
if you have an object and it doesn't
01:03
give light off right but this is a black
01:06
surface so it's not very good
01:07
so let's say it's a shiny surface right
01:10
and the light hits it and the light
01:12
coming from another source hits it and
01:15
bounces back to you
01:16
that's reflect but
01:20
if the object oh now the object
01:23
is sending out light okay so in both
01:26
cases they shine
01:28
right whether the object is sending out
01:30
light or if it's just reflecting
01:33
in both cases they shine because
01:36
you can see the light that is coming
01:38
from them whether the light is
01:40
generated there or if it's just being
01:42
reflected
01:43
off of that object okay so to shine
01:49
ring i have a ring okay
01:52
a ring of course is a circular uh
01:55
shape and there's a hole in the middle
01:58
of course
01:58
so you can put your finger around it or
02:01
inside of it
02:01
but of course in this case we have a
02:04
planet
02:05
inside of a ring a ring is the small
02:08
pieces of matter
02:09
that circle a planet what famous planet
02:12
in
02:12
our solar system has a ring actually
02:15
there are a few
02:16
planets but the most famous one is
02:19
saturn saturn has a very amazing and
02:22
colorful
02:23
ring around it and it really puzzled
02:26
early astronomers who looked at it in a
02:28
telescope like what is that thing does
02:30
it have ears
02:31
what's going on so finally they figured
02:33
out it's a ring and it's just small
02:35
pieces of
02:36
rocks and ice that are circling the
02:38
planet
02:39
just like the moon circles our planet
02:41
except imagine the moon is broken up
02:43
into tiny little pieces
02:45
and makes our ring all the way around
02:47
the planet
02:48
okay phase we saw that word
02:52
in the introduction to this lesson and
02:55
what what is phase
02:56
a phase is the change in the changes
02:59
in the shape of the moon as seen by us
03:02
of course
03:03
if you go out at night and you look at
03:04
the moon sometimes it's a perfect
03:07
white circle shining in the sky
03:10
it's not giving off light it's
03:11
reflecting light from the sun
03:13
but still shining right and sometimes
03:16
you go out at night
03:17
and the moon is just a little sliver of
03:20
light
03:21
now the changes you know when it goes
03:23
from a full circle of light to no light
03:25
and then comes back we call those the
03:28
phases
03:29
of the moon it looks like the moon is
03:31
changing
03:32
shape not really it's just the the way
03:34
that the light is reflecting off the
03:36
moon
03:36
so the changes in the shape of the moon
03:38
as seen by
03:40
us because we're on earth right if we
03:43
were in outer space in the spacecraft
03:45
maybe we wouldn't see these changes
03:48
depends on where we are okay
03:51
telescope a telescope now this is a very
03:54
expensive telescope not many people have
03:56
one of these
03:57
but you can buy a cheaper telescope
04:01
that can enable you to see
04:04
really far away so if your friend is
04:08
on the other side of a very big parking
04:11
lot from you
04:12
you can look at the telescope and they
04:14
seem very big in the telescope
04:16
but of course you can look at the stars
04:18
and at the sky with the telescope
04:20
there's a very powerful telescope
04:22
which astronomers use to study
04:25
things that are very very very
04:28
very very far away in the night sky
04:32
so a device that makes things far away
04:35
look bigger okay
04:38
next we have constellation
04:42
that's a little difficult pronunciation
04:43
right con sta
04:45
lei shun so four syllables constellation
04:50
constellation is a group of stars a
04:52
group of stars
04:54
which form a pattern and have a name
04:57
thousands of years ago our
05:00
ancestors looked up in the sky
05:03
and they saw these lights shining
05:07
in the black of the sky and
05:10
as they looked they said hey wait a
05:12
minute those stars over there though
05:14
there's point they didn't know they were
05:15
stars
05:15
those lights look like a shape
05:18
right what is that shape and and their
05:20
imagination said oh that looks like a
05:22
lion
05:23
that looks like a hunter that looks like
05:25
a scorpion
05:26
right and so these shapes they gave them
05:29
names
05:30
right a leo orion scorpio
05:34
they gave these groups of patterns these
05:37
groups of lights in the sky they
05:38
patterned them in their mind
05:40
and they gave them names to represent
05:43
mythical or legendary characters or
05:47
creatures in their stories
05:50
in their myths and in their legends and
05:53
so we have a lot of different
05:55
types of constellations and you can see
05:57
them here
05:58
and many of them of course have names
06:01
and different cultures
06:02
might have different names for them now
06:04
of course that's just how we
06:06
see them from earth if you moved to
06:09
another star system
06:10
it would all be different all right okay
06:13
or if you move to another place in the
06:15
galaxy
06:15
all these uh constellations would change
06:19
it's only from our perspective on earth
06:20
that we see these shapes
06:24
now we have solar system the sun and
06:28
all the planets that go around it so of
06:30
course we have the sun here and you can
06:32
see the
06:32
orbits of all the planets we have
06:34
mercury venus earth mars
06:36
jupiter saturn uranus uranus some
06:39
people call it uranus okay neptune
06:43
and then we have pluto and i said before
06:46
wait a minute
06:47
that's an interesting point because
06:49
nowadays
06:50
astronomers do not regard pluto as a
06:53
planet
06:54
okay we'll see that in the in the next
06:56
section we'll talk about the different
06:58
planets
06:58
of the solar system so i'll touch upon
07:01
that
07:02
point soon okay one of the main ideas
07:05
in this unit is the phases of the moon
07:08
and as i said before
07:09
we see the moon in different shapes
07:12
depending on where the moon is in the
07:14
sky
07:15
in relation to the sun and of course to
07:18
our position
07:19
on earth so we have these what we call
07:23
new moon it's not a new moon it's been
07:25
there for billions of years
07:27
okay it's not new but it looks like it's
07:29
new because well we can't see it it's
07:31
it's black and why is it black because
07:34
imagine that the sun
07:36
okay on this picture it looks like well
07:39
okay imagine that the sun is over here
07:42
okay
07:42
so if the sun is over here it's shining
07:44
light at the earth
07:46
all the it's it's making this part of
07:49
the moon very bright
07:50
but we don't see any of that light if
07:52
you're up here you know
07:53
um you won't see the moon because all
07:56
the light is shining on the moon this
07:57
way
07:58
and the rest of the moon is dark
08:02
okay to us of course the moon is always
08:04
lit by the sun
08:05
but if we're here and the sun is here we
08:08
can't see the moon
08:09
but imagine if the moon is over here
08:11
right
08:12
and of course as long as the earth isn't
08:14
in the way of the sun
08:16
that would be an eclipse but that's
08:17
something different okay so if that's if
08:19
the moon
08:19
is over here on this side and the sun is
08:22
over here and of course it would be
08:23
night
08:24
on this part then we can see the moon in
08:26
all its glory
08:27
in very bright white and it's a circle
08:31
a perfect circle in the sky now if the
08:34
sun
08:34
is only shining part of the moon right
08:37
we can see only maybe
08:38
half of the moon and the same thing over
08:41
here because the moon has these
08:42
different cycles
08:43
as the moon orbits throughout the month
08:45
and the in the earth turns
08:48
and also orbits we see different
08:51
phases of the moon we don't see
08:53
different parts of them and we always
08:54
see the same part of the moon actually
08:56
that's another interesting point but
08:58
anyway we see
09:00
the different shadows or reflections
09:03
of the light on the moon so we have new
09:05
moon then we have the first
09:07
quarter moon so the moon uh we can see
09:10
like a quarter of the moon
09:11
quarter means one fourth right then we
09:15
can see the full moon
09:16
then we see the last quarter moon and
09:18
then it goes back to a new moon so
09:20
actually it looks like this diagram is
09:22
going this way
09:24
and as it says here the moon rotates
09:28
rotates means it orb well actually it
09:31
kind of
09:32
it it is rotating yes but it's also
09:35
orbiting
09:35
around the earth i would say it r orbits
09:39
i'm not sure
09:40
rotate is the best word here orbits
09:44
the moon orbits around the earth in
09:46
about 29 days that's a month
09:48
okay and that's interesting because
09:50
again a long time ago our ancestors
09:52
thousands of years ago of course they
09:54
watched the moon
09:55
and they divided the time of the year
09:58
into 12 different periods that they
10:01
called months
10:02
because that's about how many times the
10:04
earth will
10:05
go around the earth in the period
10:09
of one year so about 12 times
10:13
that the moon will rotate or orbit or
10:15
orbit is better word orbit around the
10:17
earth
10:18
in one year 12 times so divide the year
10:20
into 12
10:21
months it's not perfect right sometimes
10:23
we have to adjust it
10:24
but it's pretty pretty close okay and of
10:27
course we call talk about the phases of
10:29
the moon
10:29
whether it's a new moon you cannot see
10:31
the moon it's black so we can't see it
10:34
and then sometimes it grows slightly
10:35
it's a little bit you know one-eighth
10:37
and one-fourth then we can see half the
10:39
moon
10:39
then three quarters of the moon then a
10:41
full moon it's very bright
10:43
and you can walk around at night without
10:45
a flashlight
10:46
you can see because the moon's giving us
10:48
a lot of light
10:49
it's actually giving us the sunlight
10:51
reflecting off the moon
10:53
and then it turns back into the black
10:56
moon that we cannot see the reflection
10:58
of the sun off it anymore and that's
11:00
what happens during
11:01
the month okay next we have the solar
11:04
system now you can see here on this
11:06
picture
11:07
right we see mercury venus earth mars
11:09
jupiter saturn
11:10
uranus or uranus neptune where is pluto
11:14
pluto's gone okay we only have eight
11:17
planets
11:18
now that's interesting because when i
11:20
was growing up when i was a kid
11:21
we said there were nine planets but then
11:24
a very bad man
11:26
named dr neil degrasse tyson took pluto
11:29
away
11:30
no i'm just kidding i'm just kidding dr
11:32
tyson
11:33
is a very popular and entertaining
11:36
astronomer
11:36
and he jokes about this sometimes too
11:38
that people blame him
11:40
for uh the fact that astronomers no
11:43
longer
11:44
consider pluto as a planet but i have a
11:47
lot of respect
11:48
for dr tyson i really like him he's a
11:50
great
11:51
astronomer he's a great educator but
11:53
anyway uh
11:55
and of course it wasn't his decision
11:56
either it was it was a group of
11:58
astronomers
11:58
why did they do that because a long time
12:01
ago when pluto was discovered
12:03
the astronomers that discovered pluto by
12:06
looking through telescopes
12:07
they only saw pluto they didn't realize
12:09
that there were a lot of
12:11
other objects out there
12:14
and nowadays with better technology
12:18
and better tools astronomers have found
12:21
there are a lot of objects like pluto
12:24
out
12:24
way out on the edge of the solar system
12:26
and pluto is more like
12:28
them than pluto is like a planet
12:32
so that's why they said oh pluto really
12:34
shouldn't be considered as a planet
12:35
it's more like these other objects that
12:37
are out there so we no longer
12:39
count pluto as a planet don't blame dr
12:42
tyson i was just kidding
12:43
okay so anyway what are the planets
12:47
uh you probably learned these in school
12:49
mercury we think about mercury as the
12:51
first planet
12:52
because it's closest to the sun mercury
12:55
is a really
12:56
hot hellish place you could not live on
12:58
the surface of mercury because it's so
13:00
close to the sun
13:01
it is the closest planet to the sun it
13:03
is very very hot
13:05
on mercury and mercury goes around very
13:08
fast
13:09
that's why the greeks call mercury the
13:11
messenger of the gods
13:12
because it moves so quickly and of
13:14
course if you want to be the messenger
13:16
of the gods
13:17
you have to move very quickly so mercury
13:20
next in order in away from the sun
13:23
is venus now venus is an interesting
13:26
planet it's very similar to earth
13:28
but it is a hottest planet why is it
13:31
so hot because it's covered by thick
13:33
clouds of gas
13:36
astronomers sometimes think and you know
13:38
nobody can prove this they just imagine
13:40
they have
13:41
hypotheses and they think that venus may
13:44
have
13:45
been like earth a long long time ago
13:48
but as the atmosphere formed because it
13:51
was closer to the sun
13:52
there was a lot more heavy gases in the
13:55
atmosphere that formed
13:56
and the sun rays heated up the surface
13:58
of venus
13:59
and it's so hot okay next we have earth
14:02
i'm getting too
14:03
too much detail okay earth of course is
14:05
where we live
14:06
earth is in the perfect zone for life
14:09
not too close to the sun
14:10
not too far we have enough uh sunlight
14:14
warmth generated by the sun we also have
14:17
water liquid water on the surface and so
14:20
we have
14:20
life on earth earth has water air
14:23
and one moon okay mars has the largest
14:27
volcano it's a next
14:29
soul planted out as the largest volcano
14:32
and it has two moons but they're very
14:34
small
14:34
and they go around mars and mars is
14:36
smaller than the earth
14:38
the next planet out is jupiter jupiter
14:40
is the largest planet
14:42
with over 60 moons did you know that
14:45
jupiter has a lot of moons going around
14:48
it because it's so big and in fact
14:50
jupiter is so
14:51
big if it were a little bit bigger i'm
14:54
not sure how much bigger it could have
14:56
formed into a star
14:57
the gravitation could have made all that
14:59
matter collapse uh
15:00
ignite in in which is what the sun is
15:03
and we could have had two suns in our
15:06
solar system but then
15:07
could life have formed on earth if that
15:09
were the case we don't know but there
15:11
are cases where solar systems have two
15:13
stars
15:13
sometimes three stars circling around
15:16
each other okay anyway
15:17
the next planet out is saturn we talked
15:19
about it with the ring around it
15:21
the next one is uranus or some people
15:23
say
15:24
uranus uh because of certain jokes about
15:27
uranus
15:27
okay uh and it's a it's a big planet
15:31
it's also what we call a gas giant and
15:33
neptune is the same
15:35
it's also a giant now i'm going too fast
15:38
because this is
15:38
i could talk forever about this but
15:40
uranus has thin rings around it
15:42
so saturn isn't the only planet with
15:44
rings a uranus has
15:46
also thin rings around it neptune is a
15:48
blue planet it has
15:50
13 moons so there are a lot of different
15:52
moons around
15:53
these big planets jupiter saturn uranus
15:56
and neptune
15:57
they have also either moons or uranus
16:00
has thin rings around it but it's very
16:02
interesting astronomers are very
16:03
interested in
16:04
sending spaceships to these moons to see
16:07
what the conditions
16:08
are on those moons okay anyway
16:11
that's a lot again i could talk for a
16:13
very long time about this
16:15
read about it look on the internet check
16:17
it out there's some
16:18
fascinating things you can find out
16:20
about the different planets
16:22
in the solar system okay
16:26
let's do the reading okay in the reading
16:28
as usual i'll read it out loud you guys
16:30
repeat after me
16:31
or think about it in your mind okay
16:34
first of all
16:35
let's start with at night because that's
16:38
when we see the stars so let's begin
16:40
at night you can see many lights in the
16:43
sky
16:44
the moon rotates around the earth
16:48
in about 29 days it also rotates on its
16:52
axis about every 29 days
16:57
so the same side of the moon
17:00
always faces the earth
17:05
we never see the other side of the moon
17:07
interesting okay we always see the same
17:09
side
17:10
because as it's orbiting it's also
17:12
turning okay
17:13
so that's interesting we always see the
17:15
same side of the moon
17:17
the moon reflects light from the sun
17:21
as the moon orbits around the earth its
17:24
shape seems to change
17:28
these shapes are called the phases of
17:31
the moon
17:32
when you see the different shapes in
17:33
these pictures right this is a
17:35
crescent shape a crescent this is
17:39
half moon and full moon
17:42
full moon full moon half moon crescent
17:45
moon
17:50
crescent moon okay
17:54
the earth is one of the eight planets in
17:57
our solar system
17:59
not nine anymore just eight
18:02
jupiter is the largest planet
18:06
more than one thousand earths could fit
18:09
inside it jupiter has 62
18:14
moons wow that's a lot of moons
18:18
the planet saturn has a ring around it
18:22
you can see jupiter's moons and saturn's
18:25
i'm sorry you can see jupiter's moons
18:29
and saturn's ring with a
18:32
telescope many stars
18:35
shine in the night sky
18:38
stars are suns they are very very
18:42
far away we actually have to say very
18:45
very very very very very very
18:47
very far away okay
18:51
some stars have planets orbiting them
18:54
stars can make patterns in the sky which
18:58
are called
18:59
constellations constellations
19:03
okay very good that's the reading
19:05
passage
19:07
now how is the information in the
19:09
reading passage organized
19:11
here we have the classic or very common
19:15
organizational pattern of main idea and
19:18
then supporting details
19:19
so what is the main idea of this passage
19:21
the main idea is
19:24
the lights in the sky are the moon
19:27
planets and stars that's interesting i i
19:31
did want to mention that too because
19:33
the lights in the sky of course we know
19:35
what the moon is we can see it it's very
19:37
big
19:38
but many a long time ago many people
19:40
thought that planets
19:41
were also stars they didn't know the
19:43
difference
19:44
they just saw these lights moving around
19:46
jupiter looks like a star
19:49
in the night sky it wasn't until much
19:51
later when people had telescopes that
19:53
they could figure out and they also
19:54
studied the motion
19:55
they could figure hey these aren't stars
19:57
there are other planets
19:59
in our solar system okay so
20:02
what are the details that support this
20:04
main idea the lights in the sky are the
20:05
moon
20:06
planets and stars the first main detail
20:08
is
20:09
the moon planets and stars are all
20:11
lights that
20:12
beep in the sky and we talked about that
20:15
and i and i
20:16
mentioned that i used my cell phone as
20:18
an example right whether they're
20:19
reflecting the light
20:20
or they're giving the light off what do
20:23
they do
20:23
they shine
20:27
so are lights that shine in the sky
20:32
saturn is one of eight planets
20:35
in our beep what do we call the group of
20:38
planets
20:40
including earth our planet that orbit
20:42
the sun
20:43
we call that the solar system and it's
20:46
our solar system because we live here
20:48
solar system solar
20:51
system two words oops
20:55
that's right solar system so saturn is
20:58
one of eight planets in our solar
21:00
system saturn has a beep around it what
21:03
is it
21:04
of course it's a ring but it's not a
21:06
ring that you put on your finger
21:08
it's a ring that goes around a planet
21:10
okay saturn has a ring
21:12
around it which you can see with a what
21:16
with a telescope telescope
21:20
so if you go out and buy a telescope
21:24
and you have to get away from the city
21:26
so you can see there's no other light
21:28
around and then look at the night sky
21:31
and see what amazing things you can see
21:33
through your telescope okay next
21:37
some stars have beep orbiting them
21:40
so of course our star soul well that's
21:43
the name of our
21:44
son soul sol has
21:47
eight planets orbiting them now as we
21:49
look out to other stars astronomers
21:51
are able to detect other planets
21:55
so some stars have planets
21:58
orbiting them who lives there what lives
22:01
there
22:02
what are the planets like these are very
22:05
amazing or very mysterious questions
22:08
that we have
22:09
and someday of course they're very very
22:12
very far away it's very hard to get to
22:14
those
22:14
planets but it's a very interesting
22:16
question
22:18
okay stars can make patterns called
22:21
what we talked about this right the our
22:23
ancestors looked up in the sky and they
22:25
they made shapes according to their
22:27
stories their myths their legends
22:29
and they made uh the patterns they made
22:32
those groupings of the stars and we call
22:34
those
22:35
con
22:37
[Music]
22:38
lay shuns four syllables
22:43
constellations we call those patterns
22:46
constellations and those are interesting
22:50
also you can
22:51
check out books or charts on the
22:53
internet to find out what the different
22:54
constellations are
22:56
and what are the star the name of the
22:58
names of the stars
22:59
in those constellations and it's
23:01
interesting some of the stars in the
23:02
constellations
23:03
have actually blown up and they will
23:06
disappear
23:07
after hundreds thousands of years okay
23:10
so anyway uh this is a you know i'm
23:12
sorry if i went too long i
23:14
gave too much detail more than the
23:16
lesson has in the book
23:17
but this is really an interesting field
23:20
of study
23:21
and i encourage you to read more to read
23:23
books
23:24
about astronomy to go on the internet go
23:27
on the internet
23:27
check out just type in mars type in
23:29
saturn type in
23:30
the moons of jupiter and find out all
23:33
sorts of
23:33
interesting and amazing details about
23:36
the different
23:37
uh planets and moons that
23:40
are orbiting the same solar system that
23:42
we are in and also check out the
23:45
interesting questions that astronomers
23:47
have and what are astronomers nowadays
23:49
working on
23:50
what are they or what are their
23:52
questions and how are they going about
23:54
trying to find the answers to those
23:56
questions it's a very fascinating
23:59
and interesting subject and apologies to
24:01
dr tyson i was just joking
24:03
okay anyway thanks for studying with me
24:06
and we'll see you in the next lesson
