hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
we're going over social studies book
4 lesson 14 getting near the end of the
book
and lesson 14 the subject is
various land forms so we will discover
what are some different
types of land forms and what are some
land forms
in the u.s the u.s of course is the
united states
oh by the way of course the picture that
you can see for this
is of the grand canyon and actually
i grew up some not not my entire
childhood
but some of my childhood i grew up in
arizona and my parents lived there now
and it's not far to go to the grand
canyon and it's a very impressive site
and that is a type of land form if you
get a chance to go
i would recommend it it's really amazing
okay
anyway let's continue
as usual we start with the vocabulary
and we have
the first word here land form right i
mentioned that
in the introduction of this lesson what
is a land
form well of course it has two
words two words were combined to make
one word
and we know what land is land of course
is
is the earth you know you look around
you see the land
form of course means shape so the land
has many different shapes right it's
a shape on the surface of the earth
and of course we can see that you look
around you can see
mountains well that's a shape of the
land that's just
a particular shape of the land that's a
land form
sometimes you see just very even if it's
just very flat we call those
planes right and that is another type of
land form so there are many different
land forms
let's take a look so the next word is
stretch
stretch means to reach out and the
reason we're looking at this word
here is because like i said i just said
you know sometimes you have planes
that's a land form
but if you look out across these planes
the land seems to
stretch out forever right it's
to reach out to stretches like to reach
out i'm i'm stretching
of course you might stretch in the
morning oh you're right you you reach
out with your
arms and your feet your hands and your
feet and you stretch your body right
well stretch out means just to reach out
it also means to like
like to pull or to uh go on forever it
seems to stretch out
and that's what this picture shows us
the land is stretching out
all the way to the horizon this
is i should just mention this
that's an h horizon teaching you a new
word here
horizon is where the land meets the sky
right that's the horizon so the land
stretches out
to the horizon okay
next word we have we talked about this
already mounted now i said
mountain but we can also add another
word
mountain range so what's the difference
between mountain
and mountain range well if you say look
at the mountain over there
it might just be one mountain just you
know there's a plane then boom there's a
mountain but it's all by itself it's
like
the lonely mountain from jared token's
hobbit okay
just one mountain sitting out there but
if there's
if the mountain is not alone if there's
a lot of mountains and they're all in a
row right they all
seem to be on a line and there's another
mountain
a bunch of mountains behind those we
call those mountain ranges
so a mountain range is a series of
mountains it's not just
one mountain it's many mountains next to
each other and they're all connected
right
you know you might have a mountain which
is the peak but you still have high land
connecting it to the next mountain and
that is a mountain range
and in the world there are many famous
and very big
uh very long mountain ranges
gulf a gulf is another type of land form
even though we're talking about water
but it's still you know it's a shape of
the land and the water
a gulf is an area of water that is
partly
partly surrounded that's important by
land it's partly because if it was
completely
surrounded it would be a lake or it
would be a sea
right not an ocean an ocean is not
completely
surrounded by land an ocean surrounds
the land
but if the land surrounds the body of
water
it's either like i said oh it could be a
pond a small lake
a lake or it could be a sea right
so in this case we're looking at the
gulf of mexico which is a famous gulf
you have america up here this is texas
you know it goes along the southern
states over here to florida
and then of course we have mexico coming
down here and the rest of central
america
but it's open you can't see the rest of
the map it's open to the atlantic ocean
so the gulf of mexico and the atlantic
ocean there's no land between them
so it's not a sea right it's a
gulf okay and of course you can see over
here the gulf of california it's very
similar right
because baja california comes down here
this is mexico of course
and then mexico the the rest of mexico
is over here
and you have some ocean that opens up
into the pacific ocean
it's not completely surrounded it's open
to a larger body of water so we call it
a gulf okay so that's a golf
located now in the previous lesson we
talked about locations right
and of course location is a noun
located you know where is
it located that describes um
where something exists or where it is
it is right not where it is being but
where it
exists or where it is in a certain place
okay so we use a sentence where is
it located where is the gulf of mexico
located okay uh south of america
east of mexico that is where it is
located so
where is it located where is it
okay good next peninsula
now peninsula is an interesting land
form right
uh and you know there are many countries
that are peninsulas there are some
states that are peninsulas
by the way i always have a little hard
time with the spelling of peninsula
and uh let me give you a little tip here
you know sometimes i i think is it
n p-e-n-n i want to put n n or s s i was
thinking is it that way
no just remember with peninsula it's one
one
one okay so if you get confused you
think should i put two ends or two s's
no no
it's one one one okay peninsula one n
then one n then one s not two ends
together
right they're separated so peninsula and
pronunciation
peninsula peninsula of course is it's
like the
opposite of a gulf okay think about it
it's an
area of land that has water around
three sides not completely surrounded
right
a gulf is not completely surrounded by
land
a peninsula is not completely surrounded
by water
it's connected to a larger body of land
take for example the korean peninsula
very famous peninsula right so you have
a peninsula but it's not completely
certain it's not the korean
island right no it's not an island it's
a peninsula because it's connected to
the rest of
asia right there is there you can walk
you don't have to cross any water
to go from korea to china to russia
right
it's all land right but
korea is surrounded on three sides
by water that makes it a peninsula
the state of florida in america you look
at a
map of america you see the state of
florida sticking down
on the east coast and that is another
peninsula surrounded by
the atlantic sea and the gulf of mexico
on the west side and the atlantic on the
east side
and the gulf of mexico comes around the
south as well
so those are peninsulas okay that's like
the opposite
of a gulf okay
trace trace means to follow something
and you probably know this word from art
class right
sometimes if you have a picture you say
oh that's a cool picture i want to draw
it so you put a piece of paper
thin paper so you can see the image
underneath and what do you do you draw
the outline
of you know i don't know what i'm
drawing here oh there we go okay now i
got it you draw the
that's a horrible heart i didn't know
where i was going okay
so you just trace the object underneath
the paper
and that's tracing so to trace means to
follow something so you're following you
know the other hearts
on the piece of paper that's a little
bit better but anyway this is also
tracing this guy here
looks like a detective he's tracing the
footprints
to find out who stole his cookie okay
so there's an there's a cookie jar back
here that's that's turned over and
there's lots of cookies on the floor and
one of them's eaten
okay so he's tracing to find out who ate
my cookie
so he's tracing the footsteps okay so to
trace means
to follow something okay those are our
words for the lesson
okay let's take a look at the first main
idea in this lesson and of course we're
talking about
land forms in the vocabulary section we
talked about
a few different land forms let's take a
look at some more
well first of all let's start at the top
and go around like a clock
that's a good logical way to look at a
diagram like this of course in the
middle we have land forms and these are
different types of landforms
now we already talked about peninsula
and i gave you the example
of the state of florida now
not the entire state of florida is a
peninsula right over here this is not a
peninsula
actually people call this that's an
interesting uh
geographical feature but of course it's
it's
made by people it's not made by nature
but you see this little piece of land
here
it's kind of stretching out it connects
to the rest of the state
we call that a pan
handle and oklahoma
oklahoma is another state sits above
texas it also has a panhandle
and texas has a panhandle at the top on
the on the west side
it also has a piece of it that kind of
sticks up
from the rest of the state we call those
we call those things
panhandles so if you're talking about
florida you can say i live in the
panhandle of florida
that means that the person lives
somewhere in the area that i'm
circling here if they live in the
peninsula then they live
somewhere along here so panhandle is
another word you can use
but anyway peninsula we talked about it
it's surrounded on three sides by water
it's the opposite of a gulf right that's
a peninsula
another land form of course is a valley
and that is between two mountains or
mountain ranges you have a valley and of
course
water usually comes down there you
usually have a river or a stream
at the bottom of a valley not always but
usually
we will have a valley next we have a
hill
and a hill of course is a small mountain
it's a mountain wannabe
okay maybe but a hill you know a hill is
easy to
climb over right well some hills are
easy to climb over some hills are more
difficult
but hills are not as big as a mountain
it's like think of a hill as a baby
mountain right that's an easy way to
think about
what is a hill okay next we have
island and i mentioned that when i was
talking about peninsula
because the peninsula is surrounded on
three sides by water but it's still
connected to the main
land mass but an island is completely
surrounded by water if you want to get
off the island
at some point you have to cross water to
get off the island
okay next we have mountain and of course
we talked about mountains before
you know you could have one single
mountain or you could have a mountain
range right many different mountains
that are connected and so you have
mountain or mountain range
and of course we also talked about plane
especially when we talk about stretch
right
planes stretch out for forever
it seems like forever but for a very
long way it's all the way to the horizon
as far as you can see that's how far the
plane stretches
and by the way when i see this i think
of the plains of texas
give you a little story one day a long
time ago my brother and i were driving
to see our sister who lived in dallas
texas and we drove across texas
and we drove from new mexico oh my gosh
it was a very very difficult trip
because we were driving in a jeep we had
the top off
so the sun was on us and we're driving
through texas and it kind of looks like
this
except it's it's worse than this there's
just
dirt and then the only thing that grew
were these oil rigs
and i'm just kidding they weren't
growing but it looked like they were the
only
the only vegetation just oil rigs as far
as you could see everywhere
and you're just driving for hours and
hours and the sun's coming down we're
like
where are we this is a very difficult
drive
but texas is a huge state it would take
you all day
to drive from one end of the state to
the next maybe two maybe a day and a
half
right it's a huge state anyway so that
reminded me of texas there
okay so those are different types of
land forms
now landforms in the u.s right what are
some different land forms in the us
again remember in the previous lesson i
taught you guys about key
a key shows you either a symbol or a
color in this case
and what that color represents or what
that symbol represents
in this case we're not talking about
symbols like we did in the last lesson
we're talking or we're looking at colors
so you can also use colors in a key
to show different things on your map in
this case
the color purple shows us where the
mountains are
and if you see these mountain range this
is a mountain range you see how long it
is
it extends for hundreds of miles or
hundreds of kilometers and this is the
appalachian range
on the east coast i've never been there
i would like to go there it's a very
beautiful area
i understand from pictures and from
movies too the last of the mohicans was
filmed
in the appalachian range now of course
many people know about the rocky
mountains and the rocky mountains aren't
just in
in america they also extend far into
canada and
this over here this is the coastal range
for mountains
it's not all mountains there are some
planes there but these are famous
are major mountain ranges in america
okay now highlands highlands of course
are like
uh they're flat but they're high
plateaus
and of course you'll find those acro
near mountains you find
the uh the plateaus here by the
appalachian mountains
you do have some plateaus right here in
the middle but this is also very famous
this high plateau we call it the high
plateau area
it's also called the the great inter
mountain
what's it called the intermountain
plateau or
the great basin it's also called the
great basin
and it's a very high area even though
it's flat it's
high in elevation because it's between
two mountain ranges the mountain
the land has been pushed up there so
even if you're living on a plane
your elevation the elevation the
distance between sea level
and where you are is quite great so
there's a lot of high deserts
and a lot of high plains in this area
now planes of course they might be a
little bit lower
uh planes are are basically
here and i i'm thinking about the great
plains that's the yellow part
the great plains are an important play
important part in american history
because they are the areas of america
that are very flat
and a long time ago huge herds of
buffalo
would migrate back and forth along these
plains you know
as winter came they went south and then
as it got warmer they went back
north and they would eat the grass and
the indians would hunt them
and the indians who lived in this area
and hunted the buffalo
they were called the great plains
indians and there were
a lot of them and so you know america
has a lot of planes in the middle
a lot of farming area in the middle very
good farming land
america grows a lot of crops and mostly
in what we call the
heartland or the middle of america then
you have mountain ranges on the west
and a mountain range on the east okay
let's do the reading and as usual i will
read it out loud
you guys repeat after me either out loud
or in your head
and focus on the vocabulary that we went
over so far
and also see if you can pick up some new
words okay let's begin you guys ready
let's start you can see many different
natural features such as mountains
on the earth's surface they
are called landforms
the landforms in north america
change from place to place
in central north america the great
plains
stretch out for thousands
of miles to the west
of the great plains the rocky mountain
ranges
reach up to the sky
and that's true i'll give you another
story one time i was driving
from the great plains towards colorado
it's coming from kansas
and i was driving towards colorado and
of course it's plains plains planes the
land rises a little bit but at a certain
point you see something in the distance
you say
what are those things and and they get
larger and larger and larger and like oh
my gosh those are mountain that's a
mountain range
that's the rocky mountain uh range and
it's
very impressive it's very amazing
because you're driving
and it's just flat flat flat also this
huge mountain range
shows up in front of you and so the to
the west of the great plains
the rocky mountain ranges reach up to
the sky it's like they're reaching up
and they're going to take up take
they're going to grab the sky that's how
tall they are
it's a very impressive sight okay
travel further west and you come to a
large
body of water called the pacific
ocean if you trace your finger
down the map you will come
to the gulf of
did this i have to interrupt here for a
second if you trace your finger down the
map along the pacific coast
you won't come to the gulf of mexico but
you if you jump over mexico
then you will come to the gulf of mexico
so be careful i got confused there the
first time i read that
so you go over mexico okay let's
continue
the gulf of mexico is located between
the united states
and mexico the south coast of the united
states
and the east coast of mexico
east of the gulf of mexico is the
florida
peninsula this is a large body of land
sticking out of the north american
continent the north american continent
has many different kinds of land forms
okay many different kinds of land forms
as we discussed
so far the lesson mountain ranges plains
uh highlands valleys all sorts of
different
types of land forms okay
that's the reading let's take a look at
how the information
is organized okay let's take a look at
how this
information in the reading passage was
organized here we have main
idea and details now of course i've said
this many times
when you do this you have a main idea
it's a general statement
it's a broad statement that you make and
then you have details that support it in
this case we have one two
three details actually four details
because the third box has two
examples but anyway we have four details
let's just put another mark there
so we have four details that support the
main
idea what is the main idea the main idea
is the north american continent
has different kinds of what well of
course in this lesson we've been talking
about
land forms so different kinds of land
forms and more than one you know there's
many different kinds of land forms what
are they well let's look at the details
the first example of a landform in the
north american continent oh by the way
the north american continent we're not
just talking about america
we're also talking about canada as well
so
don't you know that's an important point
obviously so what is the first detail
the first detail is the great
beep are in central north america
now the great what remember when i
talked about this i gave the example of
the buffalo right the great herds of
buffalo and also the
american native americans who would
travel with the buffalo and hunt them
and they were called the great
beep indians what is the blank the great
plains so in this case we're just
talking about the land form
so don't write indians the great plains
are
in central north america so those are
the great plains
and of course nowadays so it's an area
of a lot of
agriculture a lot of food is grown in
the great plains
so the rocky beep are to the west of the
great plains so if we if we're in the
great plains and we go to the west we
see this
landform rising up out of the out of the
earth
rising up huge like it's reaching up to
grab the sky
as i said before this is very impressive
what am i talking about
the rocky mountain ranges
the rocky mountain ranges the rocky
mountains
some very popular songs have been
written
about the rocky mountains and in this
case the
rocky mountain ranges that's what it
said in the reading passage
and you know it's not just one mountain
it's a range of mountains it's many
mountains connected to each other and
they
stretch uh not only not only across
america but also
into canada as well thousands of miles a
very
impressive very major feature
of the north american continent is the
rocky mountains
you find some very very tall mountains
in the rocky mountains
some very impressive scenery as well
okay moving on what's the next detail
the next detail is the beep of mexico is
located between the u.s
and mexico now what were we talking
about right between the south coast of
america
and the east coast of mexico but not
surrounded by land
right it's open so what do we call that
we call that the gulf
so the gulf the gulf of mexico is
located between the u.s and mexico
it's not surrounded by land right it's
open to the atlantic ocean
and the caribbean the caribbean is the
sea but it's
again the caribbean is not uh the
caribbean isn't
completely surrounded by land either but
we do call it the caribbean sea
so that's interesting anyway the gulf of
mexico is located between the u.s and
mexico that's the next example then we
have one more like i said there's four
details that support the main idea
because east of
it it what is it the gulf of mexico aha
east of the gulf of mexico you have this
land sticking out now this land sticking
out is not completely
surrounded by water so it's kind of like
i said it's the opposite of a gulf right
it's land that sticks out into water
surrounded on three sides
we call that of course a peninsula how
do we spell peninsula do you remember
p e is it two n's or one n
it's one n but then we have an i and
another
n is it two s's or one s it's
one s s u l a sorry my
s doesn't look great it looks like a g
okay there we go that's an s
s okay so it's a little difficult to
pronounce maybe
peninsula peninsula okay so the florida
peninsula and it's kind of interesting
when you think about it peninsula is
kind of the opposite of what a gulf is
peninsula's land a gulf is water a
peninsula is surrounded on three sides
by water
a gulf is surrounded on three sides by
land
interesting okay so our lesson
is about various land forms not just of
course
in america or the north american
continent but all over the world
think about the country in which you
live what are the
amazing land forms in your country are
there
great plains are there mountain ranges
do you live on a peninsula is there a
gulf nearby
interesting things to think about okay
well i hope you learned a lot in this
lesson not just vocabulary but also
some interesting ideas when you go out
when you take a trip
take a look around see what kind of
various land forms
you can see okay well we'll see in the
next lesson take care everybody
thanks for studying with me

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:11
textbook reading
00:13
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
00:15
we're going over social studies book
00:17
4 lesson 14 getting near the end of the
00:21
book
00:22
and lesson 14 the subject is
00:25
various land forms so we will discover
00:29
what are some different
00:31
types of land forms and what are some
00:34
land forms
00:36
in the u.s the u.s of course is the
00:38
united states
00:39
oh by the way of course the picture that
00:41
you can see for this
00:43
is of the grand canyon and actually
00:47
i grew up some not not my entire
00:50
childhood
00:51
but some of my childhood i grew up in
00:53
arizona and my parents lived there now
00:55
and it's not far to go to the grand
00:57
canyon and it's a very impressive site
01:00
and that is a type of land form if you
01:02
get a chance to go
01:03
i would recommend it it's really amazing
01:06
okay
01:07
anyway let's continue
01:10
as usual we start with the vocabulary
01:13
and we have
01:14
the first word here land form right i
01:16
mentioned that
01:17
in the introduction of this lesson what
01:20
is a land
01:21
form well of course it has two
01:24
words two words were combined to make
01:26
one word
01:27
and we know what land is land of course
01:30
is
01:30
is the earth you know you look around
01:32
you see the land
01:33
form of course means shape so the land
01:37
has many different shapes right it's
01:40
a shape on the surface of the earth
01:43
and of course we can see that you look
01:46
around you can see
01:47
mountains well that's a shape of the
01:49
land that's just
01:50
a particular shape of the land that's a
01:52
land form
01:53
sometimes you see just very even if it's
01:56
just very flat we call those
01:57
planes right and that is another type of
02:01
land form so there are many different
02:03
land forms
02:04
let's take a look so the next word is
02:07
stretch
02:08
stretch means to reach out and the
02:11
reason we're looking at this word
02:13
here is because like i said i just said
02:16
you know sometimes you have planes
02:18
that's a land form
02:19
but if you look out across these planes
02:21
the land seems to
02:22
stretch out forever right it's
02:26
to reach out to stretches like to reach
02:28
out i'm i'm stretching
02:29
of course you might stretch in the
02:30
morning oh you're right you you reach
02:32
out with your
02:33
arms and your feet your hands and your
02:35
feet and you stretch your body right
02:37
well stretch out means just to reach out
02:40
it also means to like
02:41
like to pull or to uh go on forever it
02:45
seems to stretch out
02:46
and that's what this picture shows us
02:48
the land is stretching out
02:50
all the way to the horizon this
02:54
is i should just mention this
02:57
that's an h horizon teaching you a new
03:00
word here
03:00
horizon is where the land meets the sky
03:04
right that's the horizon so the land
03:06
stretches out
03:07
to the horizon okay
03:10
next word we have we talked about this
03:12
already mounted now i said
03:13
mountain but we can also add another
03:16
word
03:17
mountain range so what's the difference
03:19
between mountain
03:21
and mountain range well if you say look
03:23
at the mountain over there
03:24
it might just be one mountain just you
03:26
know there's a plane then boom there's a
03:28
mountain but it's all by itself it's
03:30
like
03:30
the lonely mountain from jared token's
03:34
hobbit okay
03:34
just one mountain sitting out there but
03:37
if there's
03:38
if the mountain is not alone if there's
03:40
a lot of mountains and they're all in a
03:42
row right they all
03:43
seem to be on a line and there's another
03:45
mountain
03:46
a bunch of mountains behind those we
03:48
call those mountain ranges
03:50
so a mountain range is a series of
03:52
mountains it's not just
03:53
one mountain it's many mountains next to
03:56
each other and they're all connected
03:58
right
03:58
you know you might have a mountain which
04:00
is the peak but you still have high land
04:02
connecting it to the next mountain and
04:05
that is a mountain range
04:06
and in the world there are many famous
04:09
and very big
04:10
uh very long mountain ranges
04:15
gulf a gulf is another type of land form
04:18
even though we're talking about water
04:20
but it's still you know it's a shape of
04:21
the land and the water
04:23
a gulf is an area of water that is
04:26
partly
04:28
partly surrounded that's important by
04:31
land it's partly because if it was
04:33
completely
04:34
surrounded it would be a lake or it
04:36
would be a sea
04:38
right not an ocean an ocean is not
04:41
completely
04:42
surrounded by land an ocean surrounds
04:44
the land
04:45
but if the land surrounds the body of
04:47
water
04:48
it's either like i said oh it could be a
04:50
pond a small lake
04:51
a lake or it could be a sea right
04:54
so in this case we're looking at the
04:56
gulf of mexico which is a famous gulf
04:58
you have america up here this is texas
05:00
you know it goes along the southern
05:01
states over here to florida
05:03
and then of course we have mexico coming
05:05
down here and the rest of central
05:06
america
05:07
but it's open you can't see the rest of
05:08
the map it's open to the atlantic ocean
05:11
so the gulf of mexico and the atlantic
05:12
ocean there's no land between them
05:15
so it's not a sea right it's a
05:18
gulf okay and of course you can see over
05:20
here the gulf of california it's very
05:22
similar right
05:23
because baja california comes down here
05:25
this is mexico of course
05:26
and then mexico the the rest of mexico
05:29
is over here
05:30
and you have some ocean that opens up
05:32
into the pacific ocean
05:33
it's not completely surrounded it's open
05:36
to a larger body of water so we call it
05:38
a gulf okay so that's a golf
05:43
located now in the previous lesson we
05:45
talked about locations right
05:47
and of course location is a noun
05:50
located you know where is
05:53
it located that describes um
05:57
where something exists or where it is
06:00
it is right not where it is being but
06:03
where it
06:04
exists or where it is in a certain place
06:08
okay so we use a sentence where is
06:11
it located where is the gulf of mexico
06:15
located okay uh south of america
06:18
east of mexico that is where it is
06:21
located so
06:21
where is it located where is it
06:24
okay good next peninsula
06:28
now peninsula is an interesting land
06:30
form right
06:31
uh and you know there are many countries
06:35
that are peninsulas there are some
06:36
states that are peninsulas
06:38
by the way i always have a little hard
06:40
time with the spelling of peninsula
06:42
and uh let me give you a little tip here
06:44
you know sometimes i i think is it
06:47
n p-e-n-n i want to put n n or s s i was
06:49
thinking is it that way
06:50
no just remember with peninsula it's one
06:53
one
06:54
one okay so if you get confused you
06:56
think should i put two ends or two s's
06:58
no no
06:59
it's one one one okay peninsula one n
07:02
then one n then one s not two ends
07:05
together
07:05
right they're separated so peninsula and
07:08
pronunciation
07:09
peninsula peninsula of course is it's
07:12
like the
07:13
opposite of a gulf okay think about it
07:16
it's an
07:17
area of land that has water around
07:20
three sides not completely surrounded
07:23
right
07:24
a gulf is not completely surrounded by
07:26
land
07:27
a peninsula is not completely surrounded
07:29
by water
07:30
it's connected to a larger body of land
07:33
take for example the korean peninsula
07:37
very famous peninsula right so you have
07:39
a peninsula but it's not completely
07:41
certain it's not the korean
07:42
island right no it's not an island it's
07:44
a peninsula because it's connected to
07:47
the rest of
07:47
asia right there is there you can walk
07:50
you don't have to cross any water
07:52
to go from korea to china to russia
07:55
right
07:55
it's all land right but
07:59
korea is surrounded on three sides
08:02
by water that makes it a peninsula
08:05
the state of florida in america you look
08:08
at a
08:08
map of america you see the state of
08:10
florida sticking down
08:12
on the east coast and that is another
08:14
peninsula surrounded by
08:15
the atlantic sea and the gulf of mexico
08:18
on the west side and the atlantic on the
08:20
east side
08:21
and the gulf of mexico comes around the
08:23
south as well
08:24
so those are peninsulas okay that's like
08:27
the opposite
08:28
of a gulf okay
08:32
trace trace means to follow something
08:35
and you probably know this word from art
08:38
class right
08:39
sometimes if you have a picture you say
08:41
oh that's a cool picture i want to draw
08:43
it so you put a piece of paper
08:45
thin paper so you can see the image
08:46
underneath and what do you do you draw
08:48
the outline
08:49
of you know i don't know what i'm
08:51
drawing here oh there we go okay now i
08:53
got it you draw the
08:54
that's a horrible heart i didn't know
08:56
where i was going okay
08:58
so you just trace the object underneath
09:00
the paper
09:01
and that's tracing so to trace means to
09:03
follow something so you're following you
09:05
know the other hearts
09:06
on the piece of paper that's a little
09:07
bit better but anyway this is also
09:10
tracing this guy here
09:11
looks like a detective he's tracing the
09:13
footprints
09:14
to find out who stole his cookie okay
09:18
so there's an there's a cookie jar back
09:20
here that's that's turned over and
09:21
there's lots of cookies on the floor and
09:23
one of them's eaten
09:24
okay so he's tracing to find out who ate
09:26
my cookie
09:27
so he's tracing the footsteps okay so to
09:29
trace means
09:30
to follow something okay those are our
09:33
words for the lesson
09:38
okay let's take a look at the first main
09:40
idea in this lesson and of course we're
09:41
talking about
09:42
land forms in the vocabulary section we
09:45
talked about
09:46
a few different land forms let's take a
09:48
look at some more
09:50
well first of all let's start at the top
09:52
and go around like a clock
09:53
that's a good logical way to look at a
09:57
diagram like this of course in the
09:59
middle we have land forms and these are
10:00
different types of landforms
10:02
now we already talked about peninsula
10:04
and i gave you the example
10:06
of the state of florida now
10:09
not the entire state of florida is a
10:11
peninsula right over here this is not a
10:13
peninsula
10:14
actually people call this that's an
10:16
interesting uh
10:18
geographical feature but of course it's
10:20
it's
10:21
made by people it's not made by nature
10:24
but you see this little piece of land
10:25
here
10:26
it's kind of stretching out it connects
10:28
to the rest of the state
10:29
we call that a pan
10:32
handle and oklahoma
10:36
oklahoma is another state sits above
10:37
texas it also has a panhandle
10:39
and texas has a panhandle at the top on
10:42
the on the west side
10:43
it also has a piece of it that kind of
10:45
sticks up
10:47
from the rest of the state we call those
10:49
we call those things
10:50
panhandles so if you're talking about
10:52
florida you can say i live in the
10:54
panhandle of florida
10:55
that means that the person lives
10:57
somewhere in the area that i'm
10:59
circling here if they live in the
11:00
peninsula then they live
11:02
somewhere along here so panhandle is
11:05
another word you can use
11:07
but anyway peninsula we talked about it
11:09
it's surrounded on three sides by water
11:11
it's the opposite of a gulf right that's
11:15
a peninsula
11:16
another land form of course is a valley
11:19
and that is between two mountains or
11:22
mountain ranges you have a valley and of
11:24
course
11:24
water usually comes down there you
11:26
usually have a river or a stream
11:29
at the bottom of a valley not always but
11:31
usually
11:32
we will have a valley next we have a
11:35
hill
11:36
and a hill of course is a small mountain
11:39
it's a mountain wannabe
11:41
okay maybe but a hill you know a hill is
11:43
easy to
11:44
climb over right well some hills are
11:46
easy to climb over some hills are more
11:47
difficult
11:48
but hills are not as big as a mountain
11:50
it's like think of a hill as a baby
11:52
mountain right that's an easy way to
11:54
think about
11:55
what is a hill okay next we have
11:58
island and i mentioned that when i was
12:00
talking about peninsula
12:02
because the peninsula is surrounded on
12:03
three sides by water but it's still
12:05
connected to the main
12:06
land mass but an island is completely
12:10
surrounded by water if you want to get
12:12
off the island
12:13
at some point you have to cross water to
12:16
get off the island
12:18
okay next we have mountain and of course
12:20
we talked about mountains before
12:23
you know you could have one single
12:24
mountain or you could have a mountain
12:27
range right many different mountains
12:29
that are connected and so you have
12:31
mountain or mountain range
12:33
and of course we also talked about plane
12:35
especially when we talk about stretch
12:36
right
12:37
planes stretch out for forever
12:40
it seems like forever but for a very
12:42
long way it's all the way to the horizon
12:44
as far as you can see that's how far the
12:48
plane stretches
12:49
and by the way when i see this i think
12:51
of the plains of texas
12:53
give you a little story one day a long
12:55
time ago my brother and i were driving
12:57
to see our sister who lived in dallas
12:59
texas and we drove across texas
13:01
and we drove from new mexico oh my gosh
13:06
it was a very very difficult trip
13:08
because we were driving in a jeep we had
13:09
the top off
13:10
so the sun was on us and we're driving
13:12
through texas and it kind of looks like
13:14
this
13:15
except it's it's worse than this there's
13:18
just
13:18
dirt and then the only thing that grew
13:21
were these oil rigs
13:22
and i'm just kidding they weren't
13:24
growing but it looked like they were the
13:25
only
13:26
the only vegetation just oil rigs as far
13:28
as you could see everywhere
13:30
and you're just driving for hours and
13:32
hours and the sun's coming down we're
13:33
like
13:34
where are we this is a very difficult
13:37
drive
13:37
but texas is a huge state it would take
13:40
you all day
13:41
to drive from one end of the state to
13:42
the next maybe two maybe a day and a
13:44
half
13:45
right it's a huge state anyway so that
13:48
reminded me of texas there
13:49
okay so those are different types of
13:52
land forms
13:55
now landforms in the u.s right what are
13:57
some different land forms in the us
13:59
again remember in the previous lesson i
14:00
taught you guys about key
14:02
a key shows you either a symbol or a
14:05
color in this case
14:06
and what that color represents or what
14:08
that symbol represents
14:10
in this case we're not talking about
14:11
symbols like we did in the last lesson
14:13
we're talking or we're looking at colors
14:16
so you can also use colors in a key
14:18
to show different things on your map in
14:21
this case
14:22
the color purple shows us where the
14:25
mountains are
14:26
and if you see these mountain range this
14:28
is a mountain range you see how long it
14:30
is
14:30
it extends for hundreds of miles or
14:33
hundreds of kilometers and this is the
14:35
appalachian range
14:37
on the east coast i've never been there
14:40
i would like to go there it's a very
14:41
beautiful area
14:43
i understand from pictures and from
14:45
movies too the last of the mohicans was
14:47
filmed
14:48
in the appalachian range now of course
14:50
many people know about the rocky
14:52
mountains and the rocky mountains aren't
14:54
just in
14:54
in america they also extend far into
14:56
canada and
14:58
this over here this is the coastal range
15:01
for mountains
15:02
it's not all mountains there are some
15:04
planes there but these are famous
15:06
are major mountain ranges in america
15:10
okay now highlands highlands of course
15:13
are like
15:13
uh they're flat but they're high
15:16
plateaus
15:17
and of course you'll find those acro
15:19
near mountains you find
15:20
the uh the plateaus here by the
15:23
appalachian mountains
15:24
you do have some plateaus right here in
15:26
the middle but this is also very famous
15:29
this high plateau we call it the high
15:31
plateau area
15:32
it's also called the the great inter
15:36
mountain
15:36
what's it called the intermountain
15:38
plateau or
15:40
the great basin it's also called the
15:43
great basin
15:44
and it's a very high area even though
15:46
it's flat it's
15:47
high in elevation because it's between
15:49
two mountain ranges the mountain
15:51
the land has been pushed up there so
15:53
even if you're living on a plane
15:54
your elevation the elevation the
15:56
distance between sea level
15:58
and where you are is quite great so
16:01
there's a lot of high deserts
16:03
and a lot of high plains in this area
16:06
now planes of course they might be a
16:08
little bit lower
16:09
uh planes are are basically
16:13
here and i i'm thinking about the great
16:15
plains that's the yellow part
16:16
the great plains are an important play
16:19
important part in american history
16:20
because they are the areas of america
16:23
that are very flat
16:24
and a long time ago huge herds of
16:27
buffalo
16:28
would migrate back and forth along these
16:31
plains you know
16:32
as winter came they went south and then
16:34
as it got warmer they went back
16:36
north and they would eat the grass and
16:37
the indians would hunt them
16:39
and the indians who lived in this area
16:41
and hunted the buffalo
16:42
they were called the great plains
16:44
indians and there were
16:46
a lot of them and so you know america
16:49
has a lot of planes in the middle
16:51
a lot of farming area in the middle very
16:53
good farming land
16:54
america grows a lot of crops and mostly
16:57
in what we call the
16:58
heartland or the middle of america then
17:01
you have mountain ranges on the west
17:03
and a mountain range on the east okay
17:08
let's do the reading and as usual i will
17:10
read it out loud
17:12
you guys repeat after me either out loud
17:14
or in your head
17:15
and focus on the vocabulary that we went
17:17
over so far
17:18
and also see if you can pick up some new
17:20
words okay let's begin you guys ready
17:23
let's start you can see many different
17:26
natural features such as mountains
17:30
on the earth's surface they
17:33
are called landforms
17:38
the landforms in north america
17:41
change from place to place
17:45
in central north america the great
17:48
plains
17:49
stretch out for thousands
17:52
of miles to the west
17:56
of the great plains the rocky mountain
17:59
ranges
18:00
reach up to the sky
18:03
and that's true i'll give you another
18:04
story one time i was driving
18:07
from the great plains towards colorado
18:09
it's coming from kansas
18:10
and i was driving towards colorado and
18:13
of course it's plains plains planes the
18:15
land rises a little bit but at a certain
18:17
point you see something in the distance
18:18
you say
18:19
what are those things and and they get
18:21
larger and larger and larger and like oh
18:23
my gosh those are mountain that's a
18:24
mountain range
18:25
that's the rocky mountain uh range and
18:28
it's
18:28
very impressive it's very amazing
18:31
because you're driving
18:32
and it's just flat flat flat also this
18:34
huge mountain range
18:36
shows up in front of you and so the to
18:39
the west of the great plains
18:40
the rocky mountain ranges reach up to
18:42
the sky it's like they're reaching up
18:44
and they're going to take up take
18:45
they're going to grab the sky that's how
18:47
tall they are
18:48
it's a very impressive sight okay
18:51
travel further west and you come to a
18:55
large
18:56
body of water called the pacific
18:59
ocean if you trace your finger
19:02
down the map you will come
19:06
to the gulf of
19:09
did this i have to interrupt here for a
19:11
second if you trace your finger down the
19:13
map along the pacific coast
19:15
you won't come to the gulf of mexico but
19:17
you if you jump over mexico
19:19
then you will come to the gulf of mexico
19:21
so be careful i got confused there the
19:23
first time i read that
19:24
so you go over mexico okay let's
19:27
continue
19:28
the gulf of mexico is located between
19:32
the united states
19:33
and mexico the south coast of the united
19:36
states
19:37
and the east coast of mexico
19:42
east of the gulf of mexico is the
19:44
florida
19:45
peninsula this is a large body of land
19:49
sticking out of the north american
19:52
continent the north american continent
19:56
has many different kinds of land forms
20:00
okay many different kinds of land forms
20:02
as we discussed
20:04
so far the lesson mountain ranges plains
20:07
uh highlands valleys all sorts of
20:10
different
20:11
types of land forms okay
20:14
that's the reading let's take a look at
20:15
how the information
20:17
is organized okay let's take a look at
20:21
how this
20:22
information in the reading passage was
20:24
organized here we have main
20:26
idea and details now of course i've said
20:28
this many times
20:30
when you do this you have a main idea
20:31
it's a general statement
20:33
it's a broad statement that you make and
20:36
then you have details that support it in
20:38
this case we have one two
20:40
three details actually four details
20:44
because the third box has two
20:47
examples but anyway we have four details
20:49
let's just put another mark there
20:51
so we have four details that support the
20:53
main
20:54
idea what is the main idea the main idea
20:57
is the north american continent
20:59
has different kinds of what well of
21:02
course in this lesson we've been talking
21:03
about
21:04
land forms so different kinds of land
21:09
forms and more than one you know there's
21:13
many different kinds of land forms what
21:15
are they well let's look at the details
21:17
the first example of a landform in the
21:20
north american continent oh by the way
21:22
the north american continent we're not
21:23
just talking about america
21:24
we're also talking about canada as well
21:27
so
21:28
don't you know that's an important point
21:29
obviously so what is the first detail
21:32
the first detail is the great
21:33
beep are in central north america
21:36
now the great what remember when i
21:38
talked about this i gave the example of
21:40
the buffalo right the great herds of
21:42
buffalo and also the
21:44
american native americans who would
21:47
travel with the buffalo and hunt them
21:48
and they were called the great
21:50
beep indians what is the blank the great
21:53
plains so in this case we're just
21:55
talking about the land form
21:56
so don't write indians the great plains
21:59
are
22:00
in central north america so those are
22:02
the great plains
22:03
and of course nowadays so it's an area
22:06
of a lot of
22:07
agriculture a lot of food is grown in
22:10
the great plains
22:13
so the rocky beep are to the west of the
22:17
great plains so if we if we're in the
22:18
great plains and we go to the west we
22:20
see this
22:21
landform rising up out of the out of the
22:23
earth
22:24
rising up huge like it's reaching up to
22:27
grab the sky
22:28
as i said before this is very impressive
22:31
what am i talking about
22:32
the rocky mountain ranges
22:36
the rocky mountain ranges the rocky
22:38
mountains
22:39
some very popular songs have been
22:43
written
22:43
about the rocky mountains and in this
22:46
case the
22:46
rocky mountain ranges that's what it
22:48
said in the reading passage
22:50
and you know it's not just one mountain
22:54
it's a range of mountains it's many
22:56
mountains connected to each other and
22:58
they
22:58
stretch uh not only not only across
23:01
america but also
23:02
into canada as well thousands of miles a
23:06
very
23:07
impressive very major feature
23:10
of the north american continent is the
23:12
rocky mountains
23:13
you find some very very tall mountains
23:16
in the rocky mountains
23:17
some very impressive scenery as well
23:20
okay moving on what's the next detail
23:22
the next detail is the beep of mexico is
23:25
located between the u.s
23:27
and mexico now what were we talking
23:29
about right between the south coast of
23:31
america
23:31
and the east coast of mexico but not
23:33
surrounded by land
23:35
right it's open so what do we call that
23:37
we call that the gulf
23:39
so the gulf the gulf of mexico is
23:42
located between the u.s and mexico
23:44
it's not surrounded by land right it's
23:46
open to the atlantic ocean
23:48
and the caribbean the caribbean is the
23:50
sea but it's
23:51
again the caribbean is not uh the
23:53
caribbean isn't
23:54
completely surrounded by land either but
23:57
we do call it the caribbean sea
23:59
so that's interesting anyway the gulf of
24:01
mexico is located between the u.s and
24:03
mexico that's the next example then we
24:04
have one more like i said there's four
24:06
details that support the main idea
24:08
because east of
24:10
it it what is it the gulf of mexico aha
24:13
east of the gulf of mexico you have this
24:15
land sticking out now this land sticking
24:17
out is not completely
24:18
surrounded by water so it's kind of like
24:20
i said it's the opposite of a gulf right
24:23
it's land that sticks out into water
24:26
surrounded on three sides
24:27
we call that of course a peninsula how
24:30
do we spell peninsula do you remember
24:33
p e is it two n's or one n
24:36
it's one n but then we have an i and
24:38
another
24:39
n is it two s's or one s it's
24:42
one s s u l a sorry my
24:46
s doesn't look great it looks like a g
24:48
okay there we go that's an s
24:50
s okay so it's a little difficult to
24:52
pronounce maybe
24:53
peninsula peninsula okay so the florida
24:57
peninsula and it's kind of interesting
24:59
when you think about it peninsula is
25:00
kind of the opposite of what a gulf is
25:02
peninsula's land a gulf is water a
25:05
peninsula is surrounded on three sides
25:06
by water
25:07
a gulf is surrounded on three sides by
25:10
land
25:11
interesting okay so our lesson
25:15
is about various land forms not just of
25:17
course
25:18
in america or the north american
25:20
continent but all over the world
25:22
think about the country in which you
25:23
live what are the
25:25
amazing land forms in your country are
25:28
there
25:28
great plains are there mountain ranges
25:31

25:34

25:35
interesting things to think about okay
