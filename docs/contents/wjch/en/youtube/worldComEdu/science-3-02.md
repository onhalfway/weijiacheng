hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading i'm your host brian stewart
in this lesson we're going over science
book
3 lesson 2 plant
parts okay so we will discover
in this unit names for the different
plant
parts what are the different parts of
plants and what do we
call them also we'll discover what
plants do okay as usual we start with
the vocabulary
so let's get started
our first word is petal
petal is a very important part
of the plant the petal is the
the beautiful part of the plant right
they are the thin
colorful parts of a flower right
so many plants have flowers or they have
flowers
usually in the springtime right even
trees right
they will have these little green buds
and then the green buds will
open and they'll be blue or they'll be
red or white
and the the they're very thin they're
like
leaves almost but they're thin and they
feel almost like
plastic or wax and they're very colorful
so they're thin colorful
colorful sorry colorful parts
of a flower thin colorful
parts of a flower on many types of
plants
next we have a thorn ouch right
be careful a thorn is a
sharp pointed part of a plant
it's a good picture of thorns do you
like
roses many roses
when you pick be careful picking or
touching a rose bush
because they have many thorns so you
have to be very careful
if you want to give your mom or your
girlfriend
a rose be careful holding the rose right
because if you uh if the thorn
pricks your skin it actually
goes into your skin and an ow ouch
right it uh may hurt you and you have
blood right
so that's a thorn sharp pointed part of
a plant
be careful around some plants that have
thorns okay
next we have vine vine
now vines are cool plants because you
know they start off
low but as they grow they send out
little
uh we'll see the word later they're
called tendrils but they send out little
parts of the plant
that grow up a building or a wall and
it's kind of cool because
the picture shows it well you see the
vine sends out all these little branches
and they climb up or they climb along a
wall
they climb over a building many famous
colleges
in america are called ivy league
colleges because they're so old the
buildings are very old
and the vines that grew on the bottom
they grew
along the side of the building so you
don't see the building
you just see the vine so the buildings
are covered
with divines very interesting vine
okay next attract
attract is to cause someone or something
to move towards you to attract is you
know
to make someone like you or
something makes other people like it or
not just people
but it could be animals or in this case
insects
right so if you think about it a flower
has many beautiful petals
right so the is it the beautiful
colorful
petals that attract bees no
it's the smell of the the center of the
flower
the bees smell that and they're
attracted to it now of course scientists
are saying that sometimes the patterns
on the petal also attract bees so it
also helps bees but basically they're
saying hey bees
come here we've got some uh nice pollen
for you
so they're attracting bees to the flower
right if you have an ice cream truck
come through your neighborhood right you
hear the music
the music attracts all the kids to come
and get ice cream yay
or they hear the bell ding ding ding you
know the little the little musical
bells that play when the ice cream truck
comes through the neighborhood
so to attract means to to make people or
to cause people
to say oh great and they get excited and
they want to go
see something or they want to go get
something or
you know they come towards that thing
that is attracting them
okay interesting word next
support support is important
right support is uh when you hold
something in place
or you help something stand up let's say
something is not very strong
it will fall over if you don't support
it you put something here
you know maybe a a piece of wood or a
wall
to help it stand up buildings of course
have metal pieces uh to help support the
building
and a good foundation right uh older
people
might use a stick to support them as
they walk
along the trail when they go hiking
right
so support is something that helps hold
another thing
in place or helps hold another thing
upright
that's support of course we can also
talk about supporting other people
sometimes people get
sad or they feel they're not there
they need some help so you can support
other people you can cheer them up
you're helping them get back on their
feet
good job support okay
spread right before i talked about vines
right they grow up and around
they don't just grow up the building
they grow along the sides of the
building too
so so to spread means to cover a larger
and larger area over time they
spread out right spread out is usually a
common combination of words
to spread or to spread out vines
spread over the building right so they
spread out over a larger and larger area
over time to spread okay good
dandelion now everybody knows what a
dandelion is you probably see them
growing
everywhere actually my dad hated
dandelions because dandelions are
actually
weeds they're a wild plant they have
yellow flowers but like you know my dad
and many
other people they say they're they have
no use and they grow everywhere
they grow where you don't want them to
grow they will grow
in the cracks in the sidewalk my dad was
like oh we got to get rid of the
dandelions
or if he's trying to have he has grass
in front of his house
he doesn't like dandelions because
they'll take over
and they'll kill all the grass so
dandelions are a wild plant they're a
very
tough plant many people think of them as
weeds weeds is an unwanted plant
so dandelion although dandelions are
cool because you can pick them
and you can blow and all the seeds go
away so they're kind of cool too
okay dandelion cactus
now actually a cactus i have also
experienced with cactus
i used to live in arizona which is in
the southwest
part of america we had cactus
like this in our backyard they're called
saguaro that's a difficult word don't
worry
it's a type of cactus there are really
tall
cactus and there are small cactuses some
people say
cactuses some people say cacti
cacti is latin but a lot of people just
say cactuses
it's okay so there are big cactuses and
there are small cactuses there's
all different kinds of cactuses but
cactus
have one thing in common all kinds of
cactuses
they all have one thing in common do you
see on the picture
do you see those those little things
coming off the cactus
those are thorns remember we talked
about
thorns they're sharp parts of a plant
they're like
needles and on a cactus oh my gosh
they have a lot of these a lot of these
thorns
all over them right a plant covered
in thorns and they usually grow in the
desert like in
arizona where we used to live and so you
have to be careful
around the cactus because those thorns
will stick you
and even if you're walking in jeans
right they can even go through your
jeans
so you have to be careful around cacti
or cactuses okay it's a cactus
okay our last word remember i talked
about vines
they grow right as vines grow they sound
out
branches but you can also call them
tendrils
tendril is a part of a plant that can
grab onto things and if you look at the
picture you see the little curly things
at the ends
of the of the leaves on this branch
it looks like a kind of an ivy i don't
know maybe a palm
branch but those have little hooks
and they can reach out and they can grab
onto things and that's how a vine grows
up a building
they have little tendrils and little
hooks and they go into the concrete
or the brick wall and they kind of hold
on to it
and then so that supports it so it can
grow
even more and spread out over a larger
area so tendril we can see tendril is
important
but we also can see how it supports a
plant and also how it can
spread out over other areas so good word
we can use the other words we just
studied
to help explain what a tendril is
part of a plant that can grab onto
things don't worry it won't grab onto
you
it's not that fast it takes a long time
so
don't worry okay okay that wraps up our
vocabulary section
let's move on now it's time to take a
look at the visual
summary and here we can see there are
different parts of plants of course
there are
many many different kinds of plants and
some plants have
certain parts and other plants have
different parts
now many plants that grow in forests or
where there's a lot of water
they will have flowers and they will
have
petals so our picture is about petal and
thorn petals as we talked about before
they are the thin parts of a flower they
are
colorful they are colorful and they
attract
insects they make insects want to come
to them
also the smell the nectar or the pollen
also attracts insects now
other plants that grow in deserts
there's not a lot of water
they will have thorns so that's an
interesting uh
situation why do some plants have thorns
especially in the desert
well think about it in the desert
there's not a lot of water
if an animal wants to get water uh
in a forest usually in a forest there's
a stream
or there might be a lake nearby or
puddles of water
so the animals can just go and drink
from the stream
or they can drink from the lake but in
the desert there
isn't any water so what do animals do
they think well if i eat the plant the
plant has water
in it and many cacti do have water in it
you can take a cactus some kind of
cactus
and if you burn you use some kind of
torch
to burn the thorns off the cactus
then you can squeeze the cactus and
water will come out
so if you're ever in the desert and you
need water and hopefully you got a match
or some kind of a
torch with you you can burn the needles
off the
cactus you can get water that way so
anyway animals know that
so they might eat all the plants what
are the plants going to do
well the plants evolve to have thorns so
they protect the plants so the animal
doesn't come along and
eat the eat the uh cactus to get the
water
because animals don't want to eat thorns
ow
that would real wow that would really
hurt the inside of
their mouth they don't want to do that
so
some plants have thorns on their stems
thorns can protect a plant from
animals right the animals want to eat
the plant plant says no no no no
i'm going to hurt you if you try to eat
me and that's why
they have thorns okay interesting so
plants can defend themselves plants
sometimes attract animals
sometimes they say animals stay away
don't come near
okay interesting thing about plants
okay let's continue and let's look up
closer to the different
parts of a plant we already talked about
two right we saw petals attract
animals and insects to the to the uh
plant and thorns keep animals away those
are two
parts of plants what are some other
parts
of plants and you probably know some of
these or you've experienced
some of these the first word we have is
root
root now a root is a part of the plant
that is
underground right when we look at the
ground right
we only see the part of the plant that's
growing up out of the ground
but under the ground there's another
part some plants
are bigger they have really big roots
and we don't see it
and just a small part on the top so some
plants have more underground
that we can't see than they do above
ground
and think about trees trees are really
heavy and they're
big we only see them from the ground up
but trees must have really strong and
wide roots to support that heavy
tree above the ground so roots
are underground what do they do they
also they don't just support the tree or
the plant to stand it up
they also are very important because
they take in
water and nutrients from the soul
roots are like the mouth of plants they
eat the dirt around them they drink the
water
that goes into the ground and and comes
in the roots they drink that water
they eat the dirt around them so the
plant can grow
just like you eat food so that you grow
plants use their roots to take in water
and food so that they can grow and get
bigger
next we have the stem now as i said
before the stem
is usually the part that you see
sticking up from the ground underneath
of the roots
now the stem has to be supported the
roots
support the stem and the stem is
the usually long straight part
but not always you know sometimes it can
be on the ground
and it can be curvy but you know for
trees and other many other types of
plants the stem is straight and
it's long but it carries water and
nutrients
to the different parts of the plants for
example the leaves or the branches
right so that is the stem
now we have leaves of course when we
look at plants we see
wow they're green when we're in nature
especially in the spring
and the summertime we look around and
there's so much green
and those are the leaves on a plant the
leaves of course are the green parts on
the end of the branches
they're thin you can you can easily
break them or take them off of a tree
and what do leaves do well roots take in
water and they also take in food from
the soil
but leaves take in air
right they breathe the air and they also
very important plants do this we can't
do this
they use the power of the sun the energy
of the sun will hit the green leaves and
use that
energy and they'll turn it into food
for the the plant so the plant is eating
from the top and the bottom right the
plant is getting food
from many different places and energy
from many different places
leaves take in air and sunlight to make
food and help the plant grow so it's
like the plant has two different
types of mouths the roots are the mouths
but the leaves are also
kind of like mouths collecting air and
sunlight okay next we have flower
we already talked about the flower the
flowers
form fruit and seeds right now a plant
wants to reproduce right it wants to
make
more plants like it so what it usually
does
it has a little green bud that opens up
into a flower
insects come and they uh gather some of
that pollen
in the flower right and they might
use that pollen they go to another tree
and then that's how
some trees reproduce other trees like
apple trees
orange trees peach trees are you getting
hungry
they will grow fruit right and the fruit
of course they'll have a flower first
and that flower will turn into a
fruit and then you eat the fruit or
another animal eats the fruit and what's
inside the fruit
seeds so flowers form fruit
and seeds animals eat the seeds and then
walk away
and then later the seeds go we won't
talk about that but the seeds come out
of the animal
and they go onto the ground and a new
apple tree a new orange tree
a new uh pineapple a new
pineapple treasure will grow from
those seeds okay so watermelons we'll
also do it watermelons have
many seeds and you can grow not
watermelon trees
but watermelons grow on vines so many
plants will use seeds to reproduce
they make fruit and in the fruit there
are seeds to make
more plants of the same thing so that's
an important function of flowers
last we have cone now cones are only on
certain types of plants what kind of
plants can you find
uh where can you find a cone what kind
of plants
well cones are usually on what we call
pine trees or you could say fir trees
fur tree is a type of pine tree
pine tree is a tree that
doesn't really have leaves it has the
the needles probably you go into the
mountains or the hills near your house
or your apartment building
and you can see trees they don't have
leaves they have
these little thin they look like needles
and they they're not very strong but
they could uh prick you
they're a little sharp those are called
fur trees or pine trees
and they are green all year round they
don't lose their leaves
they don't turn brown in the winter like
some other trees
they are green all year round and those
trees
will produce cones and there's a picture
of a cone and they're very
very interesting they're kind of
beautiful even though they're brown
and not very bright colored but people
use them for decorations
so people will go through and they'll
pick up cones now inside the cones
though
there are seeds and squirrels usually go
and they find those seeds
and they'll keep them for the winter
time right but cones produce seeds
if those seeds fall out they will grow
another tree so
you know some flowers or some i'm sorry
some plants
will grow flowers and fruit make seeds
to reproduce
other plants like fir trees pine trees
we'll grow
cones to make seeds to make new trees
so we have lots of different parts of
plants
some parts are not on every plant but
they are common parts of plants we have
roots
all plants have roots all plants have
stems
most plants have leaves when we think
about leaves
fir trees are they leaves they're
needles they don't have leaves
some plants have flowers other plants
don't have flowers
and only a few types of plants pine
trees have cones
okay so that's interesting
about plant parts right some parts are
on every
plant but some plants are specialized
and they only have those parts only for
those
plants okay interesting okay let's move
on
next we're going to take a look at the
reading section
okay let's go over the reading section
so as usual
i will read it go ahead in your mind
read it with me
and if you want say it out loud with me
to practice speaking out loud
and pronouncing the words so in the
reading we will see
many of the vocabulary words that we
studied
are you ready let's begin
petals are the thin parts
of a flower they can be large
or small petals are
colorful and smell nice
they attract insects
dandelion flowers have many
yellow petals bees
like to visit dandelions
some plants have thorns on their stems
these thorns are sharp and
can hurt you should keep away from them
a cactus is a plant
that has many thorns
cactus plants live in
areas where there is little water
like a desert they store
water in their stems
animals want to drink this water
thorns can protect the cactus
from animals yeah we talked about that
right
animals want to drink the water in the
cactus
thorns say to the animals stay away
okay let's continue continuing
we have vines are plants
that climb or grow along the ground
vines have tendrils
they they refers back to
tendrils they are like fingers
tendrils are like fingers they are like
fingers they grab onto things
the tendrils support the vine and
hold it in place
vines can spread a long way
beans and watermelons grow
on vines
okay now let's talk about the reading
skill and this reading skill is
cause and effect cause and effect means
you have something that uh is
it happens and it creates
it because this happens another thing
happens so this is the cause
and the effect is the result of this
thing happening
so you have one action and this action
makes another action so this action is
the cause
and the other action that is a result of
that cause
cause and effect so
on the left side we see the causes
on the right side we see the effect
so the cause is just something that
happens right it's something that
maybe someone or something does
to cause another action so let's go over
this the first cause
petals smell nice if you take a flower
you smell oh smells nice very very good
what that that's that's an action right
that's a cause
what is the result or what is the effect
of that
well when insects smell the petals
they want to go to the flowers right
remember the vocabulary word that we
used or we studied
to say that if you make something
come to you you make them excited about
it and so they go
to that thing that means to attract
so petals attract attract
petals attract insects that's a c and a
t
okay so attract insects
so petals smell nice that's the cause
the effect is
insects come to smell them and to to
gather pollen
okay the next cause number two
these plant parts are sharp
and can hurt these plant parts
that's a clue right what plant parts
what are they talking about here oops
sorry right there
these plant parts right there these
plant parts are
sharp and they can hurt right they
protect plants
you should keep away from sharp things
right
so what are the part plants that are
sharp of course those are
thorns and we can say foreign
thorns so thorns protect plants
thorns are the plant's way of saying
stay away
don't come near you should keep away
from sharp things so
the cause many plants have thorns
thorns can hurt you the effect of that
is that they protect the plants
okay so the plants don't want animals to
eat them
for the water especially in deserts
where there is no water
right so thorns protect them okay the
third cause and effect is a vine
has tendrils they
they refers to tendrils they
grab onto things and beep
the vine okay so
the tendrils right think about a vine
growing up a wall
right if the if the tendrils don't grab
onto the wall
the vine will fall to the ground there's
no way for the vine to stay on the wall
the vine needs to have some what the
vine needs something to
support it so tendrils grab onto three
things and support support
support the vine so tendrils grab onto
the wall
little you know parts in the concrete or
the brick and they hold on to the wall
and they support the vine so the vine
can grow
the vine what beep a long way
so the vine is growing it's getting
bigger it's covering
more and more area over time
do you remember the vocabulary for that
yes it is
spread but we need another word here the
vine
well you could just put supports i guess
the vine but you can also put the vine
can well let's just put yeah let's put
can
can spread
that's one way another way the vine
spreads so
you have two possible okay
so the vine can spread a long way or
the vine spreads a long way
and that's because why because the vine
has tendrils
that is the cause it can support the
vine that's the cause what's the effect
the vine grows really
really far like i said many famous
colleges in america
called ivy school because the vine
spread all over the building
and the building is covered with vines
ivy so ivy league school okay
anyway that's our lesson for today very
interesting we learned about
plant parts and plants are very
interesting
organisms they're very they're not
animals they're organisms they're living
things they're different from animals
but they are very interesting because
they have a lot of different parts
and although they can't really think but
they can change
over time to respond to their natural
environment
so some flowers have petals to attract
insects
some plants grow fruit to drop seeds to
reproduce
some plants in the desert have thorns
and we have to be careful
of those so plants are very interesting
living things that we can study and we
can figure out
what you know what are about the plants
what are the causes
and what are the results of those
features
of the plants okay well that's our
lesson for today
as always thanks for studying with me
we'll see you next time
take care bye bye

hello everybody
00:10
welcome back to american textbook
00:12
reading i'm your host brian stewart
00:15
in this lesson we're going over science
00:18
book
00:18
3 lesson 2 plant
00:22
parts okay so we will discover
00:25
in this unit names for the different
00:28
plant
00:28
parts what are the different parts of
00:31
plants and what do we
00:32
call them also we'll discover what
00:35
plants do okay as usual we start with
00:39
the vocabulary
00:40
so let's get started
00:43
our first word is petal
00:47
petal is a very important part
00:50
of the plant the petal is the
00:53
the beautiful part of the plant right
00:56
they are the thin
00:58
colorful parts of a flower right
01:02
so many plants have flowers or they have
01:05
flowers
01:06
usually in the springtime right even
01:08
trees right
01:09
they will have these little green buds
01:12
and then the green buds will
01:14
open and they'll be blue or they'll be
01:16
red or white
01:18
and the the they're very thin they're
01:21
like
01:21
leaves almost but they're thin and they
01:23
feel almost like
01:25
plastic or wax and they're very colorful
01:28
so they're thin colorful
01:31
colorful sorry colorful parts
01:35
of a flower thin colorful
01:38
parts of a flower on many types of
01:41
plants
01:43
next we have a thorn ouch right
01:46
be careful a thorn is a
01:50
sharp pointed part of a plant
01:53
it's a good picture of thorns do you
01:56
like
01:57
roses many roses
02:00
when you pick be careful picking or
02:03
touching a rose bush
02:04
because they have many thorns so you
02:06
have to be very careful
02:08
if you want to give your mom or your
02:11
girlfriend
02:12
a rose be careful holding the rose right
02:15
because if you uh if the thorn
02:19
pricks your skin it actually
02:23
goes into your skin and an ow ouch
02:26
right it uh may hurt you and you have
02:29
blood right
02:30
so that's a thorn sharp pointed part of
02:34
a plant
02:35
be careful around some plants that have
02:38
thorns okay
02:42
next we have vine vine
02:45
now vines are cool plants because you
02:48
know they start off
02:48
low but as they grow they send out
02:51
little
02:52
uh we'll see the word later they're
02:54
called tendrils but they send out little
02:56
parts of the plant
02:57
that grow up a building or a wall and
03:00
it's kind of cool because
03:02
the picture shows it well you see the
03:04
vine sends out all these little branches
03:07
and they climb up or they climb along a
03:10
wall
03:10
they climb over a building many famous
03:13
colleges
03:15
in america are called ivy league
03:18
colleges because they're so old the
03:20
buildings are very old
03:21
and the vines that grew on the bottom
03:23
they grew
03:24
along the side of the building so you
03:26
don't see the building
03:27
you just see the vine so the buildings
03:30
are covered
03:31
with divines very interesting vine
03:34
okay next attract
03:38
attract is to cause someone or something
03:42
to move towards you to attract is you
03:45
know
03:46
to make someone like you or
03:49
something makes other people like it or
03:52
not just people
03:53
but it could be animals or in this case
03:56
insects
03:57
right so if you think about it a flower
04:00
has many beautiful petals
04:02
right so the is it the beautiful
04:04
colorful
04:05
petals that attract bees no
04:09
it's the smell of the the center of the
04:12
flower
04:13
the bees smell that and they're
04:15
attracted to it now of course scientists
04:17
are saying that sometimes the patterns
04:19
on the petal also attract bees so it
04:22
also helps bees but basically they're
04:24
saying hey bees
04:26
come here we've got some uh nice pollen
04:29
for you
04:30
so they're attracting bees to the flower
04:33
right if you have an ice cream truck
04:36
come through your neighborhood right you
04:38
hear the music
04:40
the music attracts all the kids to come
04:43
and get ice cream yay
04:45
or they hear the bell ding ding ding you
04:47
know the little the little musical
04:48
bells that play when the ice cream truck
04:51
comes through the neighborhood
04:53
so to attract means to to make people or
04:56
to cause people
04:57
to say oh great and they get excited and
04:59
they want to go
05:00
see something or they want to go get
05:02
something or
05:04
you know they come towards that thing
05:06
that is attracting them
05:08
okay interesting word next
05:11
support support is important
05:15
right support is uh when you hold
05:18
something in place
05:19
or you help something stand up let's say
05:22
something is not very strong
05:24
it will fall over if you don't support
05:27
it you put something here
05:28
you know maybe a a piece of wood or a
05:32
wall
05:33
to help it stand up buildings of course
05:36
have metal pieces uh to help support the
05:39
building
05:40
and a good foundation right uh older
05:43
people
05:44
might use a stick to support them as
05:47
they walk
05:48
along the trail when they go hiking
05:51
right
05:51
so support is something that helps hold
05:54
another thing
05:55
in place or helps hold another thing
05:58
upright
05:59
that's support of course we can also
06:01
talk about supporting other people
06:03
sometimes people get
06:05
sad or they feel they're not there
06:08
they need some help so you can support
06:10
other people you can cheer them up
06:12
you're helping them get back on their
06:15
feet
06:15
good job support okay
06:18
spread right before i talked about vines
06:22
right they grow up and around
06:24
they don't just grow up the building
06:25
they grow along the sides of the
06:27
building too
06:28
so so to spread means to cover a larger
06:31
and larger area over time they
06:34
spread out right spread out is usually a
06:38
common combination of words
06:40
to spread or to spread out vines
06:43
spread over the building right so they
06:46
spread out over a larger and larger area
06:50
over time to spread okay good
06:54
dandelion now everybody knows what a
06:57
dandelion is you probably see them
06:59
growing
07:00
everywhere actually my dad hated
07:03
dandelions because dandelions are
07:05
actually
07:07
weeds they're a wild plant they have
07:10
yellow flowers but like you know my dad
07:12
and many
07:13
other people they say they're they have
07:15
no use and they grow everywhere
07:17
they grow where you don't want them to
07:19
grow they will grow
07:21
in the cracks in the sidewalk my dad was
07:23
like oh we got to get rid of the
07:25
dandelions
07:26
or if he's trying to have he has grass
07:29
in front of his house
07:30
he doesn't like dandelions because
07:32
they'll take over
07:33
and they'll kill all the grass so
07:36
dandelions are a wild plant they're a
07:38
very
07:38
tough plant many people think of them as
07:41
weeds weeds is an unwanted plant
07:45
so dandelion although dandelions are
07:48
cool because you can pick them
07:50
and you can blow and all the seeds go
07:52
away so they're kind of cool too
07:54
okay dandelion cactus
07:58
now actually a cactus i have also
08:01
experienced with cactus
08:03
i used to live in arizona which is in
08:06
the southwest
08:07
part of america we had cactus
08:10
like this in our backyard they're called
08:14
saguaro that's a difficult word don't
08:17
worry
08:17
it's a type of cactus there are really
08:20
tall
08:20
cactus and there are small cactuses some
08:24
people say
08:24
cactuses some people say cacti
08:27
cacti is latin but a lot of people just
08:30
say cactuses
08:31
it's okay so there are big cactuses and
08:34
there are small cactuses there's
08:36
all different kinds of cactuses but
08:39
cactus
08:40
have one thing in common all kinds of
08:42
cactuses
08:43
they all have one thing in common do you
08:46
see on the picture
08:47
do you see those those little things
08:49
coming off the cactus
08:51
those are thorns remember we talked
08:54
about
08:54
thorns they're sharp parts of a plant
08:58
they're like
08:58
needles and on a cactus oh my gosh
09:02
they have a lot of these a lot of these
09:05
thorns
09:05
all over them right a plant covered
09:09
in thorns and they usually grow in the
09:12
desert like in
09:13
arizona where we used to live and so you
09:16
have to be careful
09:17
around the cactus because those thorns
09:20
will stick you
09:21
and even if you're walking in jeans
09:23
right they can even go through your
09:25
jeans
09:26
so you have to be careful around cacti
09:30
or cactuses okay it's a cactus
09:34
okay our last word remember i talked
09:36
about vines
09:38
they grow right as vines grow they sound
09:41
out
09:41
branches but you can also call them
09:44
tendrils
09:45
tendril is a part of a plant that can
09:47
grab onto things and if you look at the
09:50
picture you see the little curly things
09:52
at the ends
09:53
of the of the leaves on this branch
09:57
it looks like a kind of an ivy i don't
09:59
know maybe a palm
10:01
branch but those have little hooks
10:04
and they can reach out and they can grab
10:08
onto things and that's how a vine grows
10:10
up a building
10:11
they have little tendrils and little
10:12
hooks and they go into the concrete
10:15
or the brick wall and they kind of hold
10:17
on to it
10:18
and then so that supports it so it can
10:20
grow
10:21
even more and spread out over a larger
10:24
area so tendril we can see tendril is
10:28
important
10:28
but we also can see how it supports a
10:31
plant and also how it can
10:32
spread out over other areas so good word
10:36
we can use the other words we just
10:38
studied
10:39
to help explain what a tendril is
10:42
part of a plant that can grab onto
10:44
things don't worry it won't grab onto
10:46
you
10:47
it's not that fast it takes a long time
10:49
so
10:50
don't worry okay okay that wraps up our
10:52
vocabulary section
10:54
let's move on now it's time to take a
10:58
look at the visual
10:59
summary and here we can see there are
11:01
different parts of plants of course
11:03
there are
11:03
many many different kinds of plants and
11:06
some plants have
11:07
certain parts and other plants have
11:09
different parts
11:11
now many plants that grow in forests or
11:14
where there's a lot of water
11:16
they will have flowers and they will
11:19
have
11:19
petals so our picture is about petal and
11:23
thorn petals as we talked about before
11:26
they are the thin parts of a flower they
11:29
are
11:29
colorful they are colorful and they
11:32
attract
11:34
insects they make insects want to come
11:37
to them
11:37
also the smell the nectar or the pollen
11:40
also attracts insects now
11:44
other plants that grow in deserts
11:46
there's not a lot of water
11:48
they will have thorns so that's an
11:50
interesting uh
11:51
situation why do some plants have thorns
11:54
especially in the desert
11:56
well think about it in the desert
11:58
there's not a lot of water
11:59
if an animal wants to get water uh
12:03
in a forest usually in a forest there's
12:05
a stream
12:06
or there might be a lake nearby or
12:09
puddles of water
12:10
so the animals can just go and drink
12:12
from the stream
12:13
or they can drink from the lake but in
12:16
the desert there
12:17
isn't any water so what do animals do
12:20
they think well if i eat the plant the
12:22
plant has water
12:24
in it and many cacti do have water in it
12:27
you can take a cactus some kind of
12:30
cactus
12:30
and if you burn you use some kind of
12:33
torch
12:34
to burn the thorns off the cactus
12:37
then you can squeeze the cactus and
12:39
water will come out
12:40
so if you're ever in the desert and you
12:42
need water and hopefully you got a match
12:44
or some kind of a
12:46
torch with you you can burn the needles
12:49
off the
12:49
cactus you can get water that way so
12:52
anyway animals know that
12:53
so they might eat all the plants what
12:56
are the plants going to do
12:57
well the plants evolve to have thorns so
13:00
they protect the plants so the animal
13:02
doesn't come along and
13:03
eat the eat the uh cactus to get the
13:06
water
13:07
because animals don't want to eat thorns
13:10
ow
13:10
that would real wow that would really
13:12
hurt the inside of
13:13
their mouth they don't want to do that
13:16
so
13:17
some plants have thorns on their stems
13:21
thorns can protect a plant from
13:24
animals right the animals want to eat
13:26
the plant plant says no no no no
13:29
i'm going to hurt you if you try to eat
13:31
me and that's why
13:32
they have thorns okay interesting so
13:35
plants can defend themselves plants
13:37
sometimes attract animals
13:39
sometimes they say animals stay away
13:41
don't come near
13:42
okay interesting thing about plants
13:49
okay let's continue and let's look up
13:51
closer to the different
13:53
parts of a plant we already talked about
13:55
two right we saw petals attract
13:57
animals and insects to the to the uh
14:00
plant and thorns keep animals away those
14:04
are two
14:04
parts of plants what are some other
14:06
parts
14:07
of plants and you probably know some of
14:10
these or you've experienced
14:12
some of these the first word we have is
14:15
root
14:16
root now a root is a part of the plant
14:18
that is
14:19
underground right when we look at the
14:21
ground right
14:22
we only see the part of the plant that's
14:24
growing up out of the ground
14:26
but under the ground there's another
14:28
part some plants
14:29
are bigger they have really big roots
14:32
and we don't see it
14:33
and just a small part on the top so some
14:35
plants have more underground
14:37
that we can't see than they do above
14:39
ground
14:40
and think about trees trees are really
14:43
heavy and they're
14:44
big we only see them from the ground up
14:46
but trees must have really strong and
14:49
wide roots to support that heavy
14:53
tree above the ground so roots
14:56
are underground what do they do they
14:58
also they don't just support the tree or
15:00
the plant to stand it up
15:02
they also are very important because
15:04
they take in
15:05
water and nutrients from the soul
15:08
roots are like the mouth of plants they
15:12
eat the dirt around them they drink the
15:15
water
15:16
that goes into the ground and and comes
15:18
in the roots they drink that water
15:20
they eat the dirt around them so the
15:24
plant can grow
15:25
just like you eat food so that you grow
15:28
plants use their roots to take in water
15:31
and food so that they can grow and get
15:34
bigger
15:36
next we have the stem now as i said
15:39
before the stem
15:40
is usually the part that you see
15:41
sticking up from the ground underneath
15:43
of the roots
15:44
now the stem has to be supported the
15:46
roots
15:47
support the stem and the stem is
15:51
the usually long straight part
15:54
but not always you know sometimes it can
15:56
be on the ground
15:57
and it can be curvy but you know for
15:59
trees and other many other types of
16:02
plants the stem is straight and
16:05
it's long but it carries water and
16:08
nutrients
16:09
to the different parts of the plants for
16:11
example the leaves or the branches
16:14
right so that is the stem
16:18
now we have leaves of course when we
16:20
look at plants we see
16:21
wow they're green when we're in nature
16:24
especially in the spring
16:26
and the summertime we look around and
16:27
there's so much green
16:29
and those are the leaves on a plant the
16:32
leaves of course are the green parts on
16:34
the end of the branches
16:36
they're thin you can you can easily
16:38
break them or take them off of a tree
16:41
and what do leaves do well roots take in
16:44
water and they also take in food from
16:46
the soil
16:47
but leaves take in air
16:51
right they breathe the air and they also
16:54
very important plants do this we can't
16:56
do this
16:57
they use the power of the sun the energy
17:00
of the sun will hit the green leaves and
17:03
use that
17:04
energy and they'll turn it into food
17:07
for the the plant so the plant is eating
17:10
from the top and the bottom right the
17:13
plant is getting food
17:14
from many different places and energy
17:16
from many different places
17:18
leaves take in air and sunlight to make
17:22
food and help the plant grow so it's
17:25
like the plant has two different
17:27
types of mouths the roots are the mouths
17:29
but the leaves are also
17:31
kind of like mouths collecting air and
17:34
sunlight okay next we have flower
17:38
we already talked about the flower the
17:41
flowers
17:41
form fruit and seeds right now a plant
17:45
wants to reproduce right it wants to
17:47
make
17:47
more plants like it so what it usually
17:50
does
17:50
it has a little green bud that opens up
17:52
into a flower
17:54
insects come and they uh gather some of
17:57
that pollen
17:58
in the flower right and they might
18:02
use that pollen they go to another tree
18:04
and then that's how
18:05
some trees reproduce other trees like
18:08
apple trees
18:09
orange trees peach trees are you getting
18:12
hungry
18:13
they will grow fruit right and the fruit
18:17
of course they'll have a flower first
18:18
and that flower will turn into a
18:20
fruit and then you eat the fruit or
18:23
another animal eats the fruit and what's
18:24
inside the fruit
18:26
seeds so flowers form fruit
18:29
and seeds animals eat the seeds and then
18:32
walk away
18:34
and then later the seeds go we won't
18:36
talk about that but the seeds come out
18:38
of the animal
18:39
and they go onto the ground and a new
18:41
apple tree a new orange tree
18:43
a new uh pineapple a new
18:47
pineapple treasure will grow from
18:51
those seeds okay so watermelons we'll
18:54
also do it watermelons have
18:55
many seeds and you can grow not
18:57
watermelon trees
18:58
but watermelons grow on vines so many
19:01
plants will use seeds to reproduce
19:04
they make fruit and in the fruit there
19:06
are seeds to make
19:08
more plants of the same thing so that's
19:11
an important function of flowers
19:14
last we have cone now cones are only on
19:18
certain types of plants what kind of
19:21
plants can you find
19:23
uh where can you find a cone what kind
19:25
of plants
19:26
well cones are usually on what we call
19:29
pine trees or you could say fir trees
19:32
fur tree is a type of pine tree
19:34
pine tree is a tree that
19:38
doesn't really have leaves it has the
19:41
the needles probably you go into the
19:43
mountains or the hills near your house
19:45
or your apartment building
19:46
and you can see trees they don't have
19:48
leaves they have
19:49
these little thin they look like needles
19:52
and they they're not very strong but
19:54
they could uh prick you
19:56
they're a little sharp those are called
19:58
fur trees or pine trees
20:00
and they are green all year round they
20:03
don't lose their leaves
20:04
they don't turn brown in the winter like
20:06
some other trees
20:07
they are green all year round and those
20:10
trees
20:11
will produce cones and there's a picture
20:13
of a cone and they're very
20:15
very interesting they're kind of
20:17
beautiful even though they're brown
20:19
and not very bright colored but people
20:22
use them for decorations
20:24
so people will go through and they'll
20:25
pick up cones now inside the cones
20:27
though
20:28
there are seeds and squirrels usually go
20:30
and they find those seeds
20:32
and they'll keep them for the winter
20:33
time right but cones produce seeds
20:36
if those seeds fall out they will grow
20:38
another tree so
20:39
you know some flowers or some i'm sorry
20:42
some plants
20:43
will grow flowers and fruit make seeds
20:45
to reproduce
20:46
other plants like fir trees pine trees
20:49
we'll grow
20:49
cones to make seeds to make new trees
20:52
so we have lots of different parts of
20:55
plants
20:56
some parts are not on every plant but
20:59
they are common parts of plants we have
21:01
roots
21:01
all plants have roots all plants have
21:04
stems
21:06
most plants have leaves when we think
21:09
about leaves
21:10
fir trees are they leaves they're
21:11
needles they don't have leaves
21:13
some plants have flowers other plants
21:15
don't have flowers
21:16
and only a few types of plants pine
21:19
trees have cones
21:21
okay so that's interesting
21:24
about plant parts right some parts are
21:27
on every
21:28
plant but some plants are specialized
21:31
and they only have those parts only for
21:34
those
21:34
plants okay interesting okay let's move
21:37
on
21:38
next we're going to take a look at the
21:39
reading section
21:42
okay let's go over the reading section
21:45
so as usual
21:46
i will read it go ahead in your mind
21:49
read it with me
21:50
and if you want say it out loud with me
21:53
to practice speaking out loud
21:56
and pronouncing the words so in the
21:59
reading we will see
22:01
many of the vocabulary words that we
22:03
studied
22:04
are you ready let's begin
22:08
petals are the thin parts
22:11
of a flower they can be large
22:15
or small petals are
22:18
colorful and smell nice
22:22
they attract insects
22:28
dandelion flowers have many
22:31
yellow petals bees
22:34
like to visit dandelions
22:38
some plants have thorns on their stems
22:43
these thorns are sharp and
22:47
can hurt you should keep away from them
22:53
a cactus is a plant
22:56
that has many thorns
23:00
cactus plants live in
23:03
areas where there is little water
23:07
like a desert they store
23:10
water in their stems
23:14
animals want to drink this water
23:18
thorns can protect the cactus
23:22
from animals yeah we talked about that
23:26
right
23:27
animals want to drink the water in the
23:29
cactus
23:30
thorns say to the animals stay away
23:34
okay let's continue continuing
23:37
we have vines are plants
23:41
that climb or grow along the ground
23:46
vines have tendrils
23:50
they they refers back to
23:53
tendrils they are like fingers
23:57
tendrils are like fingers they are like
24:00
fingers they grab onto things
24:05
the tendrils support the vine and
24:08
hold it in place
24:11
vines can spread a long way
24:16
beans and watermelons grow
24:19
on vines
24:25
okay now let's talk about the reading
24:27
skill and this reading skill is
24:30
cause and effect cause and effect means
24:33
you have something that uh is
24:36
it happens and it creates
24:40
it because this happens another thing
24:42
happens so this is the cause
24:45
and the effect is the result of this
24:47
thing happening
24:48
so you have one action and this action
24:52
makes another action so this action is
24:56
the cause
24:57
and the other action that is a result of
25:00
that cause
25:01
cause and effect so
25:04
on the left side we see the causes
25:08
on the right side we see the effect
25:11
so the cause is just something that
25:13
happens right it's something that
25:15
maybe someone or something does
25:18
to cause another action so let's go over
25:21
this the first cause
25:22
petals smell nice if you take a flower
25:27
you smell oh smells nice very very good
25:30
what that that's that's an action right
25:33
that's a cause
25:34
what is the result or what is the effect
25:36
of that
25:37
well when insects smell the petals
25:40
they want to go to the flowers right
25:43
remember the vocabulary word that we
25:45
used or we studied
25:47
to say that if you make something
25:50
come to you you make them excited about
25:53
it and so they go
25:54
to that thing that means to attract
25:57
so petals attract attract
26:02
petals attract insects that's a c and a
26:05
t
26:06
okay so attract insects
26:09
so petals smell nice that's the cause
26:12
the effect is
26:12
insects come to smell them and to to
26:16
gather pollen
26:17
okay the next cause number two
26:21
these plant parts are sharp
26:24
and can hurt these plant parts
26:27
that's a clue right what plant parts
26:29
what are they talking about here oops
26:31
sorry right there
26:32
these plant parts right there these
26:34
plant parts are
26:35
sharp and they can hurt right they
26:38
protect plants
26:40
you should keep away from sharp things
26:43
right
26:43
so what are the part plants that are
26:45
sharp of course those are
26:47
thorns and we can say foreign
26:53
thorns so thorns protect plants
26:56
thorns are the plant's way of saying
26:58
stay away
26:59
don't come near you should keep away
27:01
from sharp things so
27:03
the cause many plants have thorns
27:06
thorns can hurt you the effect of that
27:09
is that they protect the plants
27:12
okay so the plants don't want animals to
27:14
eat them
27:15
for the water especially in deserts
27:17
where there is no water
27:18
right so thorns protect them okay the
27:22
third cause and effect is a vine
27:25
has tendrils they
27:28
they refers to tendrils they
27:32
grab onto things and beep
27:35
the vine okay so
27:39
the tendrils right think about a vine
27:41
growing up a wall
27:42
right if the if the tendrils don't grab
27:46
onto the wall
27:47
the vine will fall to the ground there's
27:49
no way for the vine to stay on the wall
27:51
the vine needs to have some what the
27:54
vine needs something to
27:56
support it so tendrils grab onto three
28:00
things and support support
28:04
support the vine so tendrils grab onto
28:08
the wall
28:09
little you know parts in the concrete or
28:11
the brick and they hold on to the wall
28:13
and they support the vine so the vine
28:16
can grow
28:16
the vine what beep a long way
28:20
so the vine is growing it's getting
28:22
bigger it's covering
28:24
more and more area over time
28:27
do you remember the vocabulary for that
28:28
yes it is
28:30
spread but we need another word here the
28:32
vine
28:33
well you could just put supports i guess
28:35
the vine but you can also put the vine
28:37
can well let's just put yeah let's put
28:40
can
28:41
can spread
28:44
that's one way another way the vine
28:48
spreads so
28:51
you have two possible okay
28:54
so the vine can spread a long way or
28:57
the vine spreads a long way
29:01
and that's because why because the vine
29:03
has tendrils
29:04
that is the cause it can support the
29:05
vine that's the cause what's the effect
29:08
the vine grows really
29:09
really far like i said many famous
29:11
colleges in america
29:13
called ivy school because the vine
29:15
spread all over the building
29:17
and the building is covered with vines
29:20
ivy so ivy league school okay
29:24
anyway that's our lesson for today very
29:26
interesting we learned about
29:28
plant parts and plants are very
29:31
interesting
29:32
organisms they're very they're not
29:33
animals they're organisms they're living
29:36
things they're different from animals
29:38
but they are very interesting because
29:40
they have a lot of different parts
29:42
and although they can't really think but
29:44
they can change
29:45
over time to respond to their natural
29:49
environment
29:49
so some flowers have petals to attract
29:52
insects
29:53
some plants grow fruit to drop seeds to
29:56
reproduce
29:57
some plants in the desert have thorns
30:00
and we have to be careful
30:01
of those so plants are very interesting
30:04
living things that we can study and we
30:07
can figure out
30:08
what you know what are about the plants
30:10
what are the causes
30:11
and what are the results of those
30:14
features
30:14
of the plants okay well that's our
30:17
lesson for today
30:18
as always thanks for studying with me
30:20
we'll see you next time
30:22
take care bye bye
