hello everyone welcome back to american
textbook reading
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
we're looking at science book 3
lesson 13. lesson 13 is about
magnets it's the title is exploring
magnets
i'm sure you've had fun playing with
magnets before
in this unit we'll talk about what
magnets
attract and how we can use
magnets okay so let's get started
of course we always begin with a
vocabulary section our first
word is attract
attract means for one object to cause
another
object to move towards it okay
attract and that is you know we're
talking about magnetism here
attraction but attraction can also be
between different people
if somebody if you see somebody and
they're very uh wow you really like them
or you like their personality
you are attracted to that person you
want to move closer to that person
don't get too close but okay but you
want to get closer to that person and be
with that person
hang around with that person well
magnets do the same thing of course they
can't think
their attraction is just natural okay
next we have repel repel is the opposite
of a tract
so if a track means the two objects are
moving closer to each other
repel means that they move away from
each other and repel is
for one object to cause another object
to move away from it
and attraction and repel are both types
of
forces right attraction will will it
will pull another thing towards it
with a certain force and repel there is
also some force
that is acting on the two objects to
separate them to make them move
away from each other
opposite opposite means to be completely
different
right if i'm going north and you're
going
south we are going in opposite
directions
okay so opposite is to be completely
uh different from each other to be
completely different direction
completely different personality a lot
of different types of
opposites
magnetic okay so now we get into some
words more specific about the
idea of this lesson magnetic means
acting like a magnet or affected
by a magnet magnetic is kind of like a
quality right
if you say um this metal is magnetic
it means that it acts like a magnet it
has that
that those forces of attraction or
repulsion
so magnetic
non-magnetic means it doesn't act like a
magnet
it's not affected by magnetic forces it
doesn't
attract other things to it it doesn't
push them away from it
it's non-magnetic okay
magnetic field now magnetic field is an
area around a magnet where the magnet's
power
is felt now this
diagram kind of shows um
the magnetic field around this magnet
and you can see the field
it's a very difficult it's a very
complicated diagram
actually if you take a look at the the
lines or somebody's artist's conception
of what a magnetic field is
but you can kind of see it this magnet
is attracting little pieces of iron
excuse me and you can see how the iron
is arranged if you just sprinkle the
iron
it will clump together like this and it
kind of shows the outlines of the
magnetic field a magnetic field is like
a field is like an invisible force
around an object you can't see it
but you can detect it using certain
tools right and there's a magnetic field
there's an electrical field
there are different these are two very
common fields
around natural objects you can't see
they're invisible
but they do have properties and we can
measure them and they do
exert some type of energy or force
around them and that's what a magnetic
field is so
an area around a magnet where the
magnet's power is felt now i'd like to
also point out one more thing though
a magnetic field isn't very large i mean
for huge objects it is but for a magnet
um
you know it doesn't take far a long
distance to get
out of the magnetic field to get away
from the area
that the magnet's power is the power of
a magnet
the area is very small right it's not
very large
so you notice that you know if you have
two magnets and you separate them
there's no there's nothing going on
between them but the closer you get
you have to get pretty close uh for the
for that
magnetic field to show itself or to
have some type of action okay so
interesting okay those are
are our vocabulary words for this lesson
let's talk about the two main ideas in
this unit the first idea is
what magnets attract so we talked about
magnets the
magnetic field around a magnet that
field will either attract another object
a magnetic object or it will
repel another magnetic object so
what do magnetics attract what do
magnets attract
they attract other magnetic objects so
what are other magnetic
objects what are examples of them well
paper clips is a good idea
or a good example if you have a magnet
you can go to your
stationary store or a little maybe in a
grocery store or
school supply store you can find lots of
magnets
and if you buy a box of paper clips you
can have fun
you know playing with the magnet and
making the paper clips do some strange
things
with the magnet okay so magnetic objects
like paper clips and
screws screws don't say nasa
right that is um
[Music]
not correct screws okay so
a screw of course is this little uh
piece of metal here you use a
screwdriver
a screwdriver to put it into wood and
you turn it it's different from a nail
although nails will also work a nail you
use a hammer
to put into the wood and then once your
nail is in the wood
you know it's done it's one use screws
can be used again and again
okay but anyway screws are made of metal
paper clips are made of metal
nails are made of metal so usually metal
objects
are magnetic magnetic objects are
attracted to magnets
but what are some things that aren't
attracted to magnets these are what we
call
non-magnetic objects and what are they
they're things like paper
wood actually paper is a type of wood
right paper is made from wood
okay and plastic plastic is
not magnetic these things do not have
metals inside of them so metals are
usually the things
that are magnetic so non-magnetic
objects are not attracted to magnets
okay if you have a magnet you try to
attract wood it won't work
if you try to attract a plastic toy with
your magnet
sorry it's not going to work okay
so how do we use magnets magnets have
this very interesting
force around them they can attract or
repel other objects
we can find very interesting uses for
magnets
and magnets are being used all around us
every day
there's one very common use of a magnet
it's been in use for hundreds of years
it used to help people find the
direction find out
which way to go okay especially for
people
on a ship right if you're on the ocean
there's no landmarks
sure you might have stars but what if
it's cloudy you can't see the sky
what do you do at night where do you go
if you have a compass
it will tell you where to go so a
compass has a magnetic
needle which always points north so if
you always know where north is
you know okay well we need we're not
going north but we're going east but we
know where north is
so we can figure out where east is so
even if you can't see the stars
there's no sun in the sky it's a very
cloudy day you can still find your
direction
using a compass next we have a crane a
magnetic crane that's interesting
a magnet at the end of the crane now
this is a very powerful magnet right
i said uh and again even though it's a
very powerful magnet it's not going to
operate over long distances
so if you if you're wearing a watch
don't worry about
a magnetic crane it's not you your arm's
not going to fly up out of the air
and hit the crane it has to be pretty
close to the crane so anyway
a magnet at the end of the crane lifts
heavy metal
objects from the trash pile so you have
like a trash pile the the main thing i
think of is like an
auto scrap yard where old automobiles
you know
people you know done with the automobile
the automobile is broken it doesn't run
anymore
they they put them in a scrap yard
and there's a crane with a metal on a
magnet on the top that'll come down
and the car will attach to the magnet
and then you can
move the car over to probably a crusher
or some machine that maybe
rips up the metal hopefully they recycle
that metal
but that's a magnetic crane of course it
can be used for a lot of different
things not just in a scrap yard
also in a refrigerator think about this
now don't do this too often because your
mom will get mad
but when you open the refrigerator door
and you close it you notice
as soon as you the door closes almost
closed it's like a force kind of
makes it close by itself and it stays
shut right
why doesn't the refrigerator door ever
just you know just
come open by itself it won't because
there are magnets
along the door and the frame of the
refrigerator
to keep it closed and that's why when
you close the refrigerator
you get almost closed it seems like it
shuts itself
also it's you don't open the
refrigerator door very easily right you
have to use some force
to break that magnetic attraction
between the magnets
thankfully refrigerator manufacturers
don't put really strong magnets on the
refrigerator
or the freezer because you'll never be
able to get the ice cream right so
it can't be a very strong magnet should
be a weaker magnet
so that you can open the refrigerator
and the freezer part
and get what you're getting whether it's
a cold drink or an ice cream bar
okay so magnets keep the refrigerator
door closed and that's important because
the door just opened by itself all that
cold air will come
out and your drinks wouldn't be cold
anymore and your ice cream would all
melt away so that's no good
so we use magnets all around us every
day
okay let's do the reading and in the
reading part as usual you can read along
with me or read along
in your mind practice pronunciation and
focus on the vocabulary that we learned
in this lesson
you guys ready let's begin
a magnet is an object that has a strong
magnetic
field most magnets are made from nickel
or iron nickel or iron are two types of
metal a magnet has two
opposite poles they are called the north
and the south poles okay not the n and
the s poles the north and the south
poles
okay the magnetic field
is the strongest at the poles
magnets can attract or repel other
magnets
if you put two magnets together what
will happen
if you put the same poles together they
repel each other
if you put opposite poles together they
attract each other
magnets can attract magnetic objects
a paper clip is magnetic if you point a
magnet
at a paper clip the magnet attracts it
magnets do not attract non-magnetic
objects paper is non-magnetic
a magnetic field can go through objects
but it will be weakened a magnet can
still attract a paperclip
through paper and that's a good trick
right if you have a magnet
and you put a piece of paper on top of
your magnet and then you put a paper
clip on top of the piece of paper
you can move the paper clip around the
piece of paper
using the magnet underneath now if
you're inventive or creative about doing
this
you can fool your friends by saying
there's some magical force
moving the paper clip around the paper
of course the more you know about
science
the more you will be able to understand
or realize that somebody who says
something is magic
that it's not true it's you know
everything has a natural
or uh scientific explanation
so the more you know about science the
more you'll be able to explain things
that you see
in nature so that's important okay good
so what is the main idea of this reading
passage the main idea is that you have a
main idea or topic
sentence and then you support that main
idea
or topic sentence with details so you
say
something and then now you want to back
it up or give examples
so what is the main idea of this reading
passage
the main idea is a magnet is an object
that has a strong magnetic field
okay and that's true that's that's a
good that's a good statement to make
and now you want to back that up by
giving examples what are examples of
that
well the first one is objects like paper
clips
are beep while paper is beep okay so we
talked about two types of things that
was the first main idea we went over
in this lesson and we talked about
things that are magnetic
like paper clips paper clips remember
are made of metal so they are magnetic
magnetic well paper is non-magnetic
magnetic paper doesn't have any metal
tin iron other types of metal in it so
it is not magnetic it doesn't is not
affected by the forces of
magnetism it is non-magnetic
so what
can magnets do magnets can beep magnetic
objects so we talked about these forces
of the magnetic field right we talked
there are two main forces attraction
and repelling or repulsion but the verb
to attract to repel so magnets can
if if you have a magnetic object next to
a magnet what happens do they
do they repel each other no they attract
each other so magnets can
attract
oops attract there we go magnus can
attract magnetic
objects right if you beep a magnet at a
paperclip the magnet will attract it
so what do you do remember the magnet
has a north and south pole so you have
to
point the magnet in the right direction
at the paper clip so you point if you
point whoops there we go if you point
a magnet at a paperclip the magnet will
attract it
it will make it come towards it it's
kind of cool really it's almost it's
like magic but it's not magic okay
it's science okay the same poles of two
magnets will okay the same poles if you
have a
south pole of one magnet and the south
pole of another magnet
what happens if you push them together
it's all really hard it's really and
this is a good experiment get two strong
magnets
and and try to push them together and
it's really hard and
they won't stick together if you let go
you stop applying force them
they'll like fly apart so the same poles
of two magnets will
repel each other repel
and the peepholes of two magnets will
attract each other so he had
the same poles what's the what's the
opposite of saying
well the opposite of same is opposite
like we talked about that that was one
of our
vocabularies so the opposite poles right
north
north pole and south pole are opposite
poles but if you
push them together right they will
attract each other you don't have to
push them very hard they will
they will attract and stick together
without much force if you just move them
close to each other
the so we have same and the pandiro or
i'm sorry
opposite opposite opposite
whoops there we go opposite so the
opposite poles of two magnets
will attract each other and they'll
stick together okay
so that wraps up our lesson for today uh
it's interesting about magnets magnets
are kind of cool to play with
you know i know maybe you get bored of
them after a little while but
they're kind of neat it's also kind of
neat to think about the magnetic force
not just around magnets but you know the
earth is like a big magnet too
it's interesting to read more about
magnetism
and magnetic fields and how they work
around us and especially
the different applications that
scientists and
people who work in technology have been
able to invent
to make our lives easier easier of
course a very common example
is the refrigerator door that's a very
easy one but what other examples can you
think of
there's magnets are in use all around us
all the time and they're very helpful to
us
and it's very interesting to think about
their their forces
not just with magnetism but then you
also get into electricity as well but
anyway that's a huge lesson
anyway i hope you learned some good
words
in this lesson and kind of use this as
maybe an introduction
into magnetism and how magnets work okay
well thanks for studying with me as
always and we'll see you in the next
lesson
take care everybody bye bye

hello everyone welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading
00:11
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
00:13
we're looking at science book 3
00:16
lesson 13. lesson 13 is about
00:19
magnets it's the title is exploring
00:22
magnets
00:23
i'm sure you've had fun playing with
00:25
magnets before
00:26
in this unit we'll talk about what
00:29
magnets
00:30
attract and how we can use
00:33
magnets okay so let's get started
00:36
of course we always begin with a
00:38
vocabulary section our first
00:40
word is attract
00:43
attract means for one object to cause
00:46
another
00:47
object to move towards it okay
00:50
attract and that is you know we're
00:52
talking about magnetism here
00:54
attraction but attraction can also be
00:56
between different people
00:57
if somebody if you see somebody and
00:59
they're very uh wow you really like them
01:01
or you like their personality
01:02
you are attracted to that person you
01:05
want to move closer to that person
01:06
don't get too close but okay but you
01:09
want to get closer to that person and be
01:11
with that person
01:12
hang around with that person well
01:14
magnets do the same thing of course they
01:15
can't think
01:16
their attraction is just natural okay
01:20
next we have repel repel is the opposite
01:23
of a tract
01:23
so if a track means the two objects are
01:26
moving closer to each other
01:27
repel means that they move away from
01:30
each other and repel is
01:31
for one object to cause another object
01:34
to move away from it
01:35
and attraction and repel are both types
01:39
of
01:39
forces right attraction will will it
01:42
will pull another thing towards it
01:44
with a certain force and repel there is
01:47
also some force
01:48
that is acting on the two objects to
01:50
separate them to make them move
01:52
away from each other
01:55
opposite opposite means to be completely
01:59
different
01:59
right if i'm going north and you're
02:02
going
02:03
south we are going in opposite
02:05
directions
02:06
okay so opposite is to be completely
02:09
uh different from each other to be
02:12
completely different direction
02:14
completely different personality a lot
02:16
of different types of
02:17
opposites
02:20
magnetic okay so now we get into some
02:23
words more specific about the
02:24
idea of this lesson magnetic means
02:28
acting like a magnet or affected
02:31
by a magnet magnetic is kind of like a
02:35
quality right
02:36
if you say um this metal is magnetic
02:39
it means that it acts like a magnet it
02:42
has that
02:43
that those forces of attraction or
02:45
repulsion
02:47
so magnetic
02:50
non-magnetic means it doesn't act like a
02:52
magnet
02:53
it's not affected by magnetic forces it
02:56
doesn't
02:57
attract other things to it it doesn't
02:59
push them away from it
03:00
it's non-magnetic okay
03:05
magnetic field now magnetic field is an
03:08
area around a magnet where the magnet's
03:11
power
03:11
is felt now this
03:14
diagram kind of shows um
03:18
the magnetic field around this magnet
03:20
and you can see the field
03:22
it's a very difficult it's a very
03:23
complicated diagram
03:25
actually if you take a look at the the
03:27
lines or somebody's artist's conception
03:30
of what a magnetic field is
03:32
but you can kind of see it this magnet
03:34
is attracting little pieces of iron
03:37
excuse me and you can see how the iron
03:39
is arranged if you just sprinkle the
03:41
iron
03:41
it will clump together like this and it
03:43
kind of shows the outlines of the
03:44
magnetic field a magnetic field is like
03:47
a field is like an invisible force
03:49
around an object you can't see it
03:51
but you can detect it using certain
03:54
tools right and there's a magnetic field
03:57
there's an electrical field
03:59
there are different these are two very
04:01
common fields
04:02
around natural objects you can't see
04:04
they're invisible
04:06
but they do have properties and we can
04:08
measure them and they do
04:09
exert some type of energy or force
04:13
around them and that's what a magnetic
04:15
field is so
04:16
an area around a magnet where the
04:18
magnet's power is felt now i'd like to
04:20
also point out one more thing though
04:21
a magnetic field isn't very large i mean
04:24
for huge objects it is but for a magnet
04:27
um
04:28
you know it doesn't take far a long
04:30
distance to get
04:31
out of the magnetic field to get away
04:33
from the area
04:35
that the magnet's power is the power of
04:37
a magnet
04:38
the area is very small right it's not
04:40
very large
04:42
so you notice that you know if you have
04:44
two magnets and you separate them
04:46
there's no there's nothing going on
04:48
between them but the closer you get
04:49
you have to get pretty close uh for the
04:52
for that
04:53
magnetic field to show itself or to
04:56
have some type of action okay so
04:58
interesting okay those are
05:00
are our vocabulary words for this lesson
05:04
let's talk about the two main ideas in
05:06
this unit the first idea is
05:08
what magnets attract so we talked about
05:10
magnets the
05:11
magnetic field around a magnet that
05:13
field will either attract another object
05:16
a magnetic object or it will
05:18
repel another magnetic object so
05:21
what do magnetics attract what do
05:23
magnets attract
05:24
they attract other magnetic objects so
05:27
what are other magnetic
05:29
objects what are examples of them well
05:30
paper clips is a good idea
05:32
or a good example if you have a magnet
05:34
you can go to your
05:35
stationary store or a little maybe in a
05:38
grocery store or
05:40
school supply store you can find lots of
05:42
magnets
05:43
and if you buy a box of paper clips you
05:46
can have fun
05:47
you know playing with the magnet and
05:50
making the paper clips do some strange
05:51
things
05:52
with the magnet okay so magnetic objects
05:55
like paper clips and
05:56
screws screws don't say nasa
06:00
right that is um
06:01
[Music]
06:04
not correct screws okay so
06:07
a screw of course is this little uh
06:09
piece of metal here you use a
06:11
screwdriver
06:12
a screwdriver to put it into wood and
06:15
you turn it it's different from a nail
06:17
although nails will also work a nail you
06:19
use a hammer
06:20
to put into the wood and then once your
06:22
nail is in the wood
06:23
you know it's done it's one use screws
06:26
can be used again and again
06:28
okay but anyway screws are made of metal
06:30
paper clips are made of metal
06:31
nails are made of metal so usually metal
06:34
objects
06:34
are magnetic magnetic objects are
06:38
attracted to magnets
06:40
but what are some things that aren't
06:42
attracted to magnets these are what we
06:44
call
06:45
non-magnetic objects and what are they
06:47
they're things like paper
06:49
wood actually paper is a type of wood
06:52
right paper is made from wood
06:54
okay and plastic plastic is
06:57
not magnetic these things do not have
07:01
metals inside of them so metals are
07:04
usually the things
07:05
that are magnetic so non-magnetic
07:09
objects are not attracted to magnets
07:12
okay if you have a magnet you try to
07:14
attract wood it won't work
07:16
if you try to attract a plastic toy with
07:18
your magnet
07:19
sorry it's not going to work okay
07:22
so how do we use magnets magnets have
07:25
this very interesting
07:27
force around them they can attract or
07:29
repel other objects
07:31
we can find very interesting uses for
07:33
magnets
07:34
and magnets are being used all around us
07:36
every day
07:37
there's one very common use of a magnet
07:40
it's been in use for hundreds of years
07:42
it used to help people find the
07:45
direction find out
07:46
which way to go okay especially for
07:49
people
07:49
on a ship right if you're on the ocean
07:52
there's no landmarks
07:53
sure you might have stars but what if
07:55
it's cloudy you can't see the sky
07:58
what do you do at night where do you go
08:00
if you have a compass
08:01
it will tell you where to go so a
08:03
compass has a magnetic
08:05
needle which always points north so if
08:08
you always know where north is
08:09
you know okay well we need we're not
08:11
going north but we're going east but we
08:12
know where north is
08:13
so we can figure out where east is so
08:15
even if you can't see the stars
08:17
there's no sun in the sky it's a very
08:18
cloudy day you can still find your
08:21
direction
08:21
using a compass next we have a crane a
08:25
magnetic crane that's interesting
08:27
a magnet at the end of the crane now
08:29
this is a very powerful magnet right
08:31
i said uh and again even though it's a
08:34
very powerful magnet it's not going to
08:36
operate over long distances
08:37
so if you if you're wearing a watch
08:39
don't worry about
08:41
a magnetic crane it's not you your arm's
08:43
not going to fly up out of the air
08:45
and hit the crane it has to be pretty
08:47
close to the crane so anyway
08:49
a magnet at the end of the crane lifts
08:51
heavy metal
08:52
objects from the trash pile so you have
08:55
like a trash pile the the main thing i
08:58
think of is like an
08:59
auto scrap yard where old automobiles
09:02
you know
09:02
people you know done with the automobile
09:04
the automobile is broken it doesn't run
09:06
anymore
09:06
they they put them in a scrap yard
09:09
and there's a crane with a metal on a
09:12
magnet on the top that'll come down
09:14
and the car will attach to the magnet
09:16
and then you can
09:17
move the car over to probably a crusher
09:19
or some machine that maybe
09:22
rips up the metal hopefully they recycle
09:23
that metal
09:25
but that's a magnetic crane of course it
09:27
can be used for a lot of different
09:29
things not just in a scrap yard
09:31
also in a refrigerator think about this
09:33
now don't do this too often because your
09:35
mom will get mad
09:36
but when you open the refrigerator door
09:38
and you close it you notice
09:40
as soon as you the door closes almost
09:42
closed it's like a force kind of
09:44
makes it close by itself and it stays
09:47
shut right
09:48
why doesn't the refrigerator door ever
09:50
just you know just
09:51
come open by itself it won't because
09:54
there are magnets
09:56
along the door and the frame of the
09:58
refrigerator
09:59
to keep it closed and that's why when
10:01
you close the refrigerator
10:02
you get almost closed it seems like it
10:04
shuts itself
10:06
also it's you don't open the
10:08
refrigerator door very easily right you
10:10
have to use some force
10:11
to break that magnetic attraction
10:13
between the magnets
10:14
thankfully refrigerator manufacturers
10:17
don't put really strong magnets on the
10:19
refrigerator
10:20
or the freezer because you'll never be
10:21
able to get the ice cream right so
10:23
it can't be a very strong magnet should
10:25
be a weaker magnet
10:27
so that you can open the refrigerator
10:29
and the freezer part
10:30
and get what you're getting whether it's
10:31
a cold drink or an ice cream bar
10:33
okay so magnets keep the refrigerator
10:36
door closed and that's important because
10:38
the door just opened by itself all that
10:40
cold air will come
10:41
out and your drinks wouldn't be cold
10:43
anymore and your ice cream would all
10:44
melt away so that's no good
10:46
so we use magnets all around us every
10:49
day
10:50
okay let's do the reading and in the
10:52
reading part as usual you can read along
10:54
with me or read along
10:55
in your mind practice pronunciation and
10:58
focus on the vocabulary that we learned
11:00
in this lesson
11:01
you guys ready let's begin
11:04
a magnet is an object that has a strong
11:07
magnetic
11:08
field most magnets are made from nickel
11:12
or iron nickel or iron are two types of
11:16
metal a magnet has two
11:19
opposite poles they are called the north
11:23
and the south poles okay not the n and
11:26
the s poles the north and the south
11:29
poles
11:29
okay the magnetic field
11:33
is the strongest at the poles
11:36
magnets can attract or repel other
11:39
magnets
11:41
if you put two magnets together what
11:44
will happen
11:47
if you put the same poles together they
11:50
repel each other
11:52
if you put opposite poles together they
11:54
attract each other
11:59
magnets can attract magnetic objects
12:02
a paper clip is magnetic if you point a
12:06
magnet
12:07
at a paper clip the magnet attracts it
12:13
magnets do not attract non-magnetic
12:17
objects paper is non-magnetic
12:21
a magnetic field can go through objects
12:25
but it will be weakened a magnet can
12:28
still attract a paperclip
12:31
through paper and that's a good trick
12:33
right if you have a magnet
12:34
and you put a piece of paper on top of
12:36
your magnet and then you put a paper
12:38
clip on top of the piece of paper
12:40
you can move the paper clip around the
12:43
piece of paper
12:44
using the magnet underneath now if
12:46
you're inventive or creative about doing
12:49
this
12:49
you can fool your friends by saying
12:51
there's some magical force
12:53
moving the paper clip around the paper
12:56
of course the more you know about
12:57
science
12:58
the more you will be able to understand
13:02
or realize that somebody who says
13:05
something is magic
13:07
that it's not true it's you know
13:09
everything has a natural
13:11
or uh scientific explanation
13:14
so the more you know about science the
13:15
more you'll be able to explain things
13:17
that you see
13:18
in nature so that's important okay good
13:23
so what is the main idea of this reading
13:24
passage the main idea is that you have a
13:26
main idea or topic
13:27
sentence and then you support that main
13:30
idea
13:30
or topic sentence with details so you
13:33
say
13:34
something and then now you want to back
13:35
it up or give examples
13:37
so what is the main idea of this reading
13:40
passage
13:41
the main idea is a magnet is an object
13:44
that has a strong magnetic field
13:48
okay and that's true that's that's a
13:50
good that's a good statement to make
13:51
and now you want to back that up by
13:53
giving examples what are examples of
13:55
that
13:55
well the first one is objects like paper
13:59
clips
13:59
are beep while paper is beep okay so we
14:03
talked about two types of things that
14:05
was the first main idea we went over
14:07
in this lesson and we talked about
14:09
things that are magnetic
14:10
like paper clips paper clips remember
14:13
are made of metal so they are magnetic
14:18
magnetic well paper is non-magnetic
14:23
magnetic paper doesn't have any metal
14:27
tin iron other types of metal in it so
14:30
it is not magnetic it doesn't is not
14:32
affected by the forces of
14:34
magnetism it is non-magnetic
14:37
so what
14:41
can magnets do magnets can beep magnetic
14:44
objects so we talked about these forces
14:47
of the magnetic field right we talked
14:49
there are two main forces attraction
14:51
and repelling or repulsion but the verb
14:54
to attract to repel so magnets can
14:58
if if you have a magnetic object next to
15:01
a magnet what happens do they
15:03
do they repel each other no they attract
15:05
each other so magnets can
15:07
attract
15:10
oops attract there we go magnus can
15:13
attract magnetic
15:14
objects right if you beep a magnet at a
15:18
paperclip the magnet will attract it
15:20
so what do you do remember the magnet
15:22
has a north and south pole so you have
15:24
to
15:24
point the magnet in the right direction
15:26
at the paper clip so you point if you
15:28
point whoops there we go if you point
15:32
a magnet at a paperclip the magnet will
15:35
attract it
15:36
it will make it come towards it it's
15:38
kind of cool really it's almost it's
15:40
like magic but it's not magic okay
15:42
it's science okay the same poles of two
15:45
magnets will okay the same poles if you
15:47
have a
15:48
south pole of one magnet and the south
15:50
pole of another magnet
15:52
what happens if you push them together
15:54
it's all really hard it's really and
15:55
this is a good experiment get two strong
15:57
magnets
15:58
and and try to push them together and
16:00
it's really hard and
16:01
they won't stick together if you let go
16:04
you stop applying force them
16:05
they'll like fly apart so the same poles
16:08
of two magnets will
16:09
repel each other repel
16:13
and the peepholes of two magnets will
16:16
attract each other so he had
16:17
the same poles what's the what's the
16:20
opposite of saying
16:21
well the opposite of same is opposite
16:23
like we talked about that that was one
16:24
of our
16:25
vocabularies so the opposite poles right
16:27
north
16:28
north pole and south pole are opposite
16:30
poles but if you
16:31
push them together right they will
16:33
attract each other you don't have to
16:34
push them very hard they will
16:35
they will attract and stick together
16:37
without much force if you just move them
16:39
close to each other
16:40
the so we have same and the pandiro or
16:43
i'm sorry
16:44
opposite opposite opposite
16:48
whoops there we go opposite so the
16:51
opposite poles of two magnets
16:53
will attract each other and they'll
16:54
stick together okay
16:56
so that wraps up our lesson for today uh
16:59
it's interesting about magnets magnets
17:00
are kind of cool to play with
17:02
you know i know maybe you get bored of
17:04
them after a little while but
17:05
they're kind of neat it's also kind of
17:07
neat to think about the magnetic force
17:09
not just around magnets but you know the
17:11
earth is like a big magnet too
17:13
it's interesting to read more about
17:15
magnetism
17:16
and magnetic fields and how they work
17:19
around us and especially
17:20
the different applications that
17:22
scientists and
17:24
people who work in technology have been
17:27
able to invent
17:28
to make our lives easier easier of
17:30
course a very common example
17:31
is the refrigerator door that's a very
17:33
easy one but what other examples can you
17:34
think of
17:35
there's magnets are in use all around us
17:37
all the time and they're very helpful to
17:39
us
17:40
and it's very interesting to think about
17:42
their their forces
17:43
not just with magnetism but then you
17:45
also get into electricity as well but
17:46
anyway that's a huge lesson
17:48
anyway i hope you learned some good
17:51
words
17:51
in this lesson and kind of use this as
17:54
maybe an introduction
17:56
into magnetism and how magnets work okay
17:59
well thanks for studying with me as
18:01
always and we'll see you in the next
18:02
lesson
18:03
take care everybody bye bye
