in every group there is one leader and
many
followers right and sometimes people

if you are
trustworthy if you trust somebody and
you are honest to that person
and even if they do something that you
think is not
good or maybe they hurt you a little bit
but you say
no i forgive them and i will continue to
help them and be honest with them
then you are loyal okay everybody makes
mistakes right
so if you can forgive that person maybe
they made an honest mistake
but don't give up on that person be
loyal dogs
are very loyal to their masters right
dogs will follow
and they will trust and they will you
know dogs will be honest i guess
to their owners because they're loyal
they will follow their
owners dogs are very loyal okay next one
simple and necessary something that's
simple
and necessary what could that word be
we're talking about
basic something that's very basic basic
means
easy right when you go to school you go
to elementary school first
that's basic you learn the basic skills
reading writing and doing math
arithmetic reading writing and
arithmetic
so we learn the basic skills the first
or simple
skills simple but necessary you need to
learn the basic skills
in order to advance and become better at
something
okay next one
to get rid of solid waste from your body
right in korean i think you say right uh
be careful
joshim hail right if you have a dog in
your apartment
oh you can step in the what
in the poop in the poop them say and
it's on your foot oh no
then you have to wash it off right by
the way this is poop
another one where the doggy goes to the
bathroom but it's like
water i think you say ojong ojum ojum
yeah ojun
then you say p so
p and poop well actually by the way
people will also say poo right
p and poo sometimes people will say poop
also it's just you know it doesn't
matter you can say poo
or poop doesn't matter p usually is just
p
okay very interesting lesson here right
okay
so a couple of things you have to be
careful of especially when you have a
pet
you get up in the morning you're going
to the bathroom and oh
oh no did you step and pee or did you
step and poo
okay then you have to say to the dog hey
go to the bathroom in the right place
okay next one trash this is just
another word for trash there's many
different words for trash
and that is another one is garbage be
careful
sometimes people will say waste
but waste is not so commonly used
for the things that you throw away from
your house right
in your house you have garbage mom will
say
take out the garbage throw away the
garbage
she could also say throw away the trash
she would never say
throw away the waste no waste is usually
used
when we're talking about a factory or
industry or like pollution we don't
usually use
waste when we're talking about the
garbage in our houses
or in our classroom right waste is
usually things that are
that are left over or things that are uh
not used or just thrown away on a big
scale like
industrial scale in a factory in our
houses we say garbage
or trash and you could say like hujitong
right
we can say trash can or garbage can
we don't say waste well but some people
say waste
waste paper can or waste bin that's
possible but it's common to say trash
can
or garbage can or been okay next one
11 to honor and look up to
if you honor somebody and look up to
that person what are you doing
you respect that person okay respect can
be a verb
it can also be a noun that's a v sorry
about that
that's a v so verb and noun you can
have respect for someone and
you can respect someone so as a verb i
respect you as a noun i
have respect for you okay
so respect can be a verb or a noun next
one
to try oh whoa this is kind of cool whoa
look at that
right he's what is this cat doing and
this cat is like oh watch out
this cat is trying to harm of course
they're just playing right cats are very
cute kyoto right when they're playing so
this cat is attacking attack right of
course you probably know attack from
playing video games right a lot of video
games
you attack the other team or the other
player
okay next one to not
pay attention to she looks upset right
she's not happy with him
right and he's sorry he's like saying
i'm sorry but she's not happy she
doesn't want to talk to him
what is she doing she is ignoring him
to ignore somebody sometimes when you're
angry with your friends you ignore them
right because you're angry
but be patient right be patient listen
to them
try to forgive them okay what did they
do but by the way this is interesting
she turned
her back
on so the expression is turn someone's
back on another person so she
turned her back on him that's a good
expression to use
in fact if you watch the lion king it's
kind of an old movie but it's a great
movie
there's a good scene in there where scar
the evil lion
walks away from mufasa right and mufasa
says don't turn your back on me
right and that's a very interesting uh
expression right don't turn your back on
me don't ignore me
so it's a good idiom okay next one
whoa this guy looks really weird looks
strange he's
mad another word for mad is angry right
we already uh
talked about that right when i was
talking about patience right it's very
easy to get very angry at something
but another word for angry is mad
but be careful americans say mad
is the same as angry that's american
american english if you're british
usually british people will say mad is
the same as
crazy right michi right
crazy oh he's mad so a british person if
a british person says oh he's mad
it means he's crazy but if an american
person say
says he's mad it means he's angry
okay so be careful there's difference
between american english and british
english
on several several ways and this is one
of them
okay a room with a toilet sink and
usually a shower
or bath okay of course you go to this
place every morning right you
you you go poo there you pee there
okay but be careful using poo and pee
usually people say
you go to the bathroom in this room you
take a shower in this room
you brush your teeth in this room what
is it
of course it's the bathroom and of
course
because there's a bath there that's the
important thing it's the bathroom
okay next one being afraid
who likes to go to the dentist i don't
like to go to the dentist oh
so we might be scared of the dentist
we're scared of the dentist we're afraid
of the dentist
right hopefully your dentist is good and
doesn't make you
scared but don't worry you need to go to
the dentist
many times in your life next one
okay let's talk about the review
okay let's see how well we remember
these words
our instructions are choose the word
that best completes the sentence
here are our words down here and here
are blanks and you'll notice
we're skipping all the even numbers so
we're just going to do one
three five seven okay so we'll just do
four
okay so number one john is a beep friend
he would never lie to me so
think about that word again somebody who
is
honest and trustworthy you can depend on
them
what word did we learn that means that
okay
loyal bad basic or new well if you
remember
we said loyal loyal friend is a person
who never lies to you it's somebody who
you can trust and who is always honest
to you
lie is the opposite of honest right
so if somebody is loyal to you they are
always honest with you they are loyal
they won't lie to you they won't
do something to hurt you okay they are
loyal
okay number three the teacher will beep
us with a pizza
party but only if we do well on the test
so
we got a couple things here right we
have one thing is
pizza party a pizza party that's a great
thing right yay we're very happy to get
a pizza party
that's something very good but we only
get it
if if
what we do well on the test if we
do a good job on the test the teacher
will
do something right what word did we
learn
that means something like that the
teacher will give us a gift
if we do a good job what word means that
a train b reward
c inform and d let
and of course they're all verbs because
only a verb will fit in here
after will so train reward inform or let
of course you remember the word is
reward
the teacher will reward us because if we
do a good job
we do well on the test the teacher will
reward us
what is the reward a pizza party yay
not trained not informed not let those
don't fit the best word is reward okay
next one number five fighting and lying
are bad
what okay now think about it
the rules at school think about the
rules at school or the rules at your
home
are you allowed to fight and to lie at
home
no that's against the rules at home in
school
are you allowed to fight your classmates
or lie to your teacher
no that's against the rules of the
school
so behavior that is against the rules of
something
okay i just said the answer there right
is like fighting and lying
is it a patience b problem c behavior
or d tricks right i just said behavior
right
fighting and lying are bad behavior it's
against the rules of a certain place
that's what we talked about before it's
not bad patience that doesn't make sense
bad problem fighting and lying are bad
problems
right you could do that but remember you
have to have
s at the end of that fighting and lying
are bad tricks
that's ysung hail it's best to say
fighting and lying or bad behavior
that's the best answer there
okay number seven the new team
beep is very strong okay
so the new team what remember on a team
there are many people
right and who are those people a lot of
those people
are followers but there's one person in
that group
who's going to do what a homework be
trick
c treat or d leader okay so think about
that which word makes sense here the new
team homework
doesn't make sense the new team trick
that doesn't fit the new team treat
that doesn't make any sense at all the
new team leader ah
that's the only one that makes sense
right so
that must be the answer the new team
leader
is very strong right so the leader of
the team
is a strong person so that team is
probably
also pretty strong you got to be careful
okay
well that wraps up the vocabulary
section of the lesson
let's take a short break and go to the
reading

09:50
respect you as a noun i
09:53
have respect for you okay
09:56
so respect can be a verb or a noun next
10:00
one
10:01
to try oh whoa this is kind of cool whoa
10:03
look at that
10:04
right he's what is this cat doing and
10:06

10:10
they're just playing right cats are very
10:12
cute kyoto right when they're playing so
10:15
this cat is attacking attack right of
10:18
course you probably know attack from
10:20
playing video games right a lot of video
10:22
games
10:22
you attack the other team or the other
10:25
player
10:26
okay next one to not
10:29
pay attention to she looks upset right
10:32
she's not happy with him
10:34
right and he's sorry he's like saying
10:36
i'm sorry but she's not happy she
10:38
doesn't want to talk to him
10:39
what is she doing she is ignoring him
10:43
to ignore somebody sometimes when you're
10:47
angry with your friends you ignore them
10:49
right because you're angry
10:50
but be patient right be patient listen
10:53
to them
10:54
try to forgive them okay what did they
10:55
do but by the way this is interesting
10:58
she turned
11:02
her back
11:07
on so the expression is turn someone's
11:10
back on another person so she
11:13
turned her back on him that's a good
11:16
expression to use
11:18
in fact if you watch the lion king it's
11:20
kind of an old movie but it's a great
11:21
movie
11:22
there's a good scene in there where scar
11:24
the evil lion
11:26
walks away from mufasa right and mufasa
11:28
says don't turn your back on me
11:30
right and that's a very interesting uh
11:33
expression right don't turn your back on
11:35
me don't ignore me
11:37
so it's a good idiom okay next one
11:41
whoa this guy looks really weird looks
11:43
strange he's
11:44
mad another word for mad is angry right
11:48
we already uh
11:49
talked about that right when i was
11:50
talking about patience right it's very
11:52
easy to get very angry at something
11:54
but another word for angry is mad
11:57
but be careful americans say mad
12:01
is the same as angry that's american
12:05
american english if you're british
12:08
usually british people will say mad is
12:11
the same as
12:12
crazy right michi right
12:15
crazy oh he's mad so a british person if
12:18
a british person says oh he's mad
12:20
it means he's crazy but if an american
12:23
person say
12:24
says he's mad it means he's angry
12:27
okay so be careful there's difference
12:28
between american english and british
12:30
english
12:31
on several several ways and this is one
12:33
of them
12:34

12:38
usually a shower
12:39

12:42
place every morning right you
12:43

12:46

12:48
usually people say
12:49

12:52

12:53
you brush your teeth in this room what
12:56
is it
12:56
of course it's the bathroom and of
12:59
course
13:00
because there's a bath there that's the
13:02
important thing it's the bathroom
13:04
okay next one being afraid
13:08
who likes to go to the dentist i don't
13:11
like to go to the dentist oh
13:13
so we might be scared of the dentist
13:17
we're scared of the dentist we're afraid
13:19
of the dentist
13:20
right hopefully your dentist is good and
13:23
doesn't make you
13:24
scared but don't worry you need to go to
13:28
the dentist
13:30
many times in your life next one
13:33
okay let's talk about the review
13:36
okay let's see how well we remember
13:38
these words
13:40
our instructions are choose the word
13:41
that best completes the sentence
13:43
here are our words down here and here
13:45
are blanks and you'll notice
13:46
we're skipping all the even numbers so
13:49
we're just going to do one
13:50
three five seven okay so we'll just do
13:53
four
13:54
okay so number one john is a beep friend
13:57
he would never lie to me so
14:00
think about that word again somebody who
14:03
is
14:03
honest and trustworthy you can depend on
14:07
them
14:08
what word did we learn that means that
14:10
okay
14:11
loyal bad basic or new well if you
14:14
remember
14:15
we said loyal loyal friend is a person
14:18
who never lies to you it's somebody who
14:21
you can trust and who is always honest
14:24
to you
14:25
lie is the opposite of honest right
14:28
so if somebody is loyal to you they are
14:30
always honest with you they are loyal
14:32
they won't lie to you they won't
14:35
do something to hurt you okay they are
14:38
loyal
14:39
okay number three the teacher will beep
14:41
us with a pizza
14:42
party but only if we do well on the test
14:45
so
14:46
we got a couple things here right we
14:48
have one thing is
14:49
pizza party a pizza party that's a great
14:53
thing right yay we're very happy to get
14:55
a pizza party
14:56
that's something very good but we only
14:59
get it
15:00
if if
15:03
what we do well on the test if we
15:07
do a good job on the test the teacher
15:09
will
15:10
do something right what word did we
15:13
learn
15:13
that means something like that the
15:15
teacher will give us a gift
15:17
if we do a good job what word means that
15:20
a train b reward
15:24
c inform and d let
15:27
and of course they're all verbs because
15:29
only a verb will fit in here
15:31
after will so train reward inform or let
15:35
of course you remember the word is
15:37
reward
15:38
the teacher will reward us because if we
15:41
do a good job
15:42
we do well on the test the teacher will
15:44
reward us
15:45
what is the reward a pizza party yay
15:49
not trained not informed not let those
15:51
don't fit the best word is reward okay
15:54
next one number five fighting and lying
15:58
are bad
15:59
what okay now think about it
16:02
the rules at school think about the
16:04
rules at school or the rules at your
16:06
home
16:06
are you allowed to fight and to lie at
16:09
home
16:10
no that's against the rules at home in
16:13
school
16:13
are you allowed to fight your classmates
16:16
or lie to your teacher
16:17
no that's against the rules of the
16:20
school
16:21
so behavior that is against the rules of
16:23
something
16:24
okay i just said the answer there right
16:26
is like fighting and lying
16:27
is it a patience b problem c behavior
16:31
or d tricks right i just said behavior
16:34
right
16:35
fighting and lying are bad behavior it's
16:38
against the rules of a certain place
16:41
that's what we talked about before it's
16:43
not bad patience that doesn't make sense
16:46
bad problem fighting and lying are bad
16:48
problems
16:50
right you could do that but remember you
16:52
have to have
16:53
s at the end of that fighting and lying
16:55
are bad tricks
16:57
that's ysung hail it's best to say
16:59
fighting and lying or bad behavior
17:01
that's the best answer there
17:03
okay number seven the new team
17:06
beep is very strong okay
17:09
so the new team what remember on a team
17:12
there are many people
17:14
right and who are those people a lot of
17:16
those people
17:17
are followers but there's one person in
17:20
that group
17:20
who's going to do what a homework be
17:23
trick
17:24
c treat or d leader okay so think about
17:27
that which word makes sense here the new
17:30
team homework
17:31
doesn't make sense the new team trick
17:34
that doesn't fit the new team treat
17:37
that doesn't make any sense at all the
17:39
new team leader ah
17:40
that's the only one that makes sense
17:43
right so
17:44
that must be the answer the new team
17:46
leader
17:47
is very strong right so the leader of
17:50
the team
17:51
is a strong person so that team is
17:54
probably
17:54
also pretty strong you got to be careful
17:57
okay
17:58
well that wraps up the vocabulary
18:00
section of the lesson
18:01
let's take a short break and go to the
18:12
