you have many pictures in your mind
right if you think about something
you can make different pictures some
ideas come into your mind
so you make pictures in your mind what

sounds
and put them together quickly imagine

excuse me to imagine okay next word
number two
whoa what's going on here this is the
earth and there are people
all around the earth on the surface

of something
what do we say it is surrounding that
thing
surround surround you can hear
two sounds su round

everything's
calm everybody's friendly everybody's
happy peace
and it's full it's full of peace so
peaceful peaceful
it's peaceful in the park i hope so
okay it's peaceful in the park okay
moving on our next word here
this is a very old structure there are
many
old ruins in the world we don't know
who built them or why they were built so
it's a puzzle or a secret we don't know
if something is a puzzle or a secret we
don't know
the answer to it it is a mystery
mystery how many sounds mystery
three sounds mister
re mystery mystery
okay put them together quickly mystery
it's a mystery
i don't know it's a mystery so when you
don't know
it's a mystery okay next one number five
nice
picture right sailing on a boat to move
by boat using the wind and i just said
it right
to sailing on a boat to sail to sail
these people are sailing they are going
across the water
not with an engine right they're not
using an engine
they're using these big pieces of cloth
and the wind is blowing them across the
water
so they are sailing to sail means to go
across the water with the power of the
wind
not with an engine with the power of a
wind
of the wind that's really what sail
means however
motor boats big boats with big engines
people still say
let's they are sailing across the
pacific ocean for example
sometimes people still do that but
really that the the
first and uh most uh first meaning that
comes to mind when you think of sail
is to move across the water with wind
power
okay okay so that's the sail next one
see-through now this picture is a little
um i have to explain it a little bit
to see through means you can see through
the air
very easily right you can see through
the air
very easily also another thing that you
can see through
is a window a window
you can see through the glass of a
window see through
but you can't see through the window if
the window's not
clear if the window is dirty you can't
see through it
because it's not clear if it's a cloudy
day
or there's a lot of smoke or dust in the
air
then it's not clear it's dirty you can't
see through it
but something that you can see through
is clear
you can see wow you can really see far
and you can see
very well because it's clear whether
it's
glass whether it's air water can be
clear you can see very
clearly through water so these things
are clear
okay number seven
this is an interesting picture it looks
like they're at the north pole or maybe
the south pole
they're uh in a boat and they're looking
around to look around
and discover especially people who go
someplace for the first time right it's
hard to discover
new places in the world these days
because
most places have already been discovered
what do we call that if you're going to
explore something
you're discovering something explore and
then of course the person who does this
is an explorer
and explorer a hundred years ago
there were many explorers a hundred
hundred fifty years ago
there were many explorers who explored
different parts of the world and
discovered many new things
okay next one eight not moving much
if there's a leaf on the water and the
leaf is not moving
it's just you know moving maybe a little
bit but not a lot
right it's just staying still what do we
say it's
calm actually we saw this word before
right
when we saw the park it's calm and not
violent
peaceful well another word for peaceful
is calm
now you have these two l m calm
calm right it's calm the water is
calm it doesn't move much it moves a
little bit maybe
but not much or it doesn't move at all
it's calm
no motion no action it's calm
some people say calm is boring but
sometimes calm is peaceful
and nice too so it depends what you want
okay next one number nine wow that is
not calm that's exciting right
it's violent it's uh uh it's got a lot
of
energy right so wow this is really cool
very cool picture a hill of water moving
across the sea
well of course it doesn't usually look
like this this is when it breaks
right when it when it hits land but if
we look over here we can see a better
example
of it right here what do we call this
and surfers right
let's go surfing now everybody's
learning right surfers
will use these to go surfing on very
cool we of course call it a wave
a wave and waves move through the water
like this right these are waves it's
like a hill
right says it's a hill it's like a small
hill of course this is where the wave
breaks right and this is a wave but it's
breaking they don't usually
go like this they only do this when they
hit land or rocks or something under
water that makes them do that that's
really unusual very unique picture
okay next one ten a very big boat this
is a very big boat
huge boat uh you know it's using an
engine so there's no
sails on the boat right this this uh
boat is moving
by engine power right by gasoline but
what do we call this big
boat we call it a ship right a ship
is a very big boat now ships can have
engines
ships can also have sails right a ship
is just a really big
boat if you're in a small row boat with
your friend
going across the river you're not in a
ship you're in a boat
right but if you're on a really big boat
you know that has many rooms
and can carry a lot of people or can
carry a lot of
things then that is a ship okay next one
11. wow she's happy she's got ton maria
sayo right
she's got a lot of money right so to
find
pleasure in she's very happy she's
finding pleasure
in money i hope she finds pleasure in
other things besides money
right in her life right we can find
pleasure in our friends
we find pleasure in spending time with
our family
right so what do we do when we're with
our friends and we're having a good time
or we're going camping with our family
everybody's having a good time
we say they're enjoying they're enjoying
themselves to enjoy themselves
means to have fun together we are
enjoying
ourselves if you go watch a movie you
can enjoy the movie it's a good movie
let's go enjoy a movie together okay
enjoy
next one number 12. now be careful with
this one we see these children
they're going across the street okay i
just use the word there
from one side to the other side if
you're talking about
from one side to the other side let's
say you have a cliff here and there's a
river
there's another cliff okay and you build
a bridge
this is a bridge okay and
okay i'm not a good artist but anyway
that's a bridge this bridge is going
across across right it goes from one
side
to the other from one side to the other
side this is a cross
this line goes across the street
be careful many students make a mistake
they say these children will across the
street
a cross is not a verb
these children are not acrossing the
street these children are
crossing the street
to cross the street
so if you are giving directions to
somebody
you say go to the intersection
then cross the street
cross is a verb don't say
across the street because that's not a
verb you can't tell
somebody to across the street across as
a preposition right
it means from one side to the other it's
not a verb
don't tell people to across the street
tell people to cross the street
you should cross the street here
at the light don't cross the street
in the middle of the block that's
dangerous
cross the street here not here
here cross the street here so be careful
between
a cross and cross don't make a mistake
the bridge goes across the river
people cross the street okay please
remember that i hear many mistakes
okay next one number 13. so
these kids are having fun right they got
their bikes what are they doing
uh well here we have a definition here a
trip
in a vehicle such as a car bicycle or
train so it's an interesting word here
and the word
is to ro a ride now that's interesting
ride
can be a noun a ride
for example let's take a ride
right let's take a bike ride let's take
a a
a ride in our car let's take a ride by
train
that's a noun but ride can also be
a verb right let's ride
a bicycle to ride a bicycle
right so we're gonna ride a bicycle
ride in a car ride on a train
okay but be careful when you ride you
ride
on a bicycle
right you don't ride in a bicycle
you can't ride inside the bicycle that's
very strange right
you can't get inside your bicycle you
can ride on top of your bicycle
ride on a bicycle ride on
a train but be careful we say
on a train but we're not on top of the
train that's crazy right that'd be
really dangerous we're inside the train
but we say ride on a train english is
crazy sometimes i'm sorry
what about car yeah we ride in a car
we ride in a car in a car in
whoops in a car so be careful
we ride on a bicycle on a train but we
ride
in a car that makes sense don't ride on
a car right that's dangerous
okay so you're right in a car so ride
can be a noun
take a ride let's go on a
bicycle ride that's a noun or verb
ride on a bicycle let's ride on a
bicycle
let's ride in a car okay so ride can
mean
different things depending how you use
it okay
next one ah

at this picture
right because helping you to rest oh
very calm
very peaceful nice wind warm weather
there's a nice hammock on the beach
beautiful scenery what is this place
this

that's not relaxing right you want it to
be quiet
dark you know then you can relax and go
to sleep
okay next one uh underwater right the
lowest part of something
uh maybe you're at the uh well i don't
want to say the word
but the very lowest part right let's say
you have the ocean right here's the
ocean
well imagine that's very big and there's
the water
we're talking about the lowest part of
something the
lowest part what do we call it we call
it the bottom
this is the bottom of the ocean or the
bottom
of the lake okay the bottom
bottom bottom so two sounds
bottom bottom okay you say botum
you could do that but most people just
say bottom
bottom okay so the bottom of something
is the lowest part
of something the bottom okay
16. a person who studies a science
a person who studies some kind of
science of course it's very easy
it's a person who studies science we use
this word and we make it a little bit
different
scientist scientist
people who study things you can use ist
very commonly scientist first let's
concentrate on this word
psy and tist how many sounds do you hear
psy and tist psy
and tist scientist
scientist okay so that's the word and
remember
ist is used for many things especially
when we're talking about science
people who study geology what are they
called

ist people who study biology
biologists
wow okay what about people who study
chemistry any idea
chemist chemist
chemist okay so geologist biologist
chemist okay these are people usually
you use ist to talk about the
people who study these sciences
okay okay let's
review the words let's do some word
vocabulary exercises
how well do you remember the words let's
go over them what we're doing is we're
going to use these words we have
four definitions right we want to write
the word
next to its meaning or its definition
these are our words first of all we have
imagine imagine
imagine that's the first word sale is
our second word
sale next mystery
mystery mystery mystery
so mystery and then we have calm
calm okay those are our four words we
need to match them
to our definitions number one a puzzle
or
secret something that you don't know
right we talked about this i don't know
it's a what is it it's a mystery
i hope that question was not a mystery
to you
you should know the answer right away
so it's not a mystery to you because we
studied that before
hopefully none of these questions are a
mystery to you okay
number two not moving much something
that doesn't move much
right it kind of stays in the same place
maybe moves a little bit
but not much doesn't move much it is
what
calm calm so a leaf on the water
or the wind in the air there's not very
windy it's very
calm okay that's another way to use calm
next one number three to picture in your
mind so you have many pictures in your
mind
and you're thinking of something you're
making pictures and you're
you're thinking of new things or
fantastical things
like magic or different places
adventure right you're thinking about
these things in your mind
you are imagining to imagine
to imagine is to picture in your mind
number four

05:21
nice
05:21
picture right sailing on a boat to move
05:25
by boat using the wind and i just said
05:28
it right
05:29
to sailing on a boat to sail to sail
05:32
these people are sailing they are going
05:35
across the water
05:36
not with an engine right they're not
05:39
using an engine
05:40
they're using these big pieces of cloth
05:44
and the wind is blowing them across the
05:47
water
05:48
so they are sailing to sail means to go
05:52
across the water with the power of the
05:55
wind
05:56
not with an engine with the power of a
05:59
wind
05:59
of the wind that's really what sail
06:01
means however
06:04
motor boats big boats with big engines
06:06
people still say
06:08
let's they are sailing across the
06:10
pacific ocean for example
06:12
sometimes people still do that but
06:14
really that the the
06:16
first and uh most uh first meaning that
06:20
comes to mind when you think of sail
06:21
is to move across the water with wind
06:24
power
06:25
okay okay so that's the sail next one
06:28
see-through now this picture is a little
06:30
um i have to explain it a little bit
06:32
to see through means you can see through
06:34
the air
06:36
very easily right you can see through
06:39
the air
06:40
very easily also another thing that you
06:42
can see through
06:43
is a window a window
06:47
you can see through the glass of a
06:49
window see through
06:51
but you can't see through the window if
06:53
the window's not
06:54
clear if the window is dirty you can't
06:57
see through it
06:59
because it's not clear if it's a cloudy
07:02
day
07:02
or there's a lot of smoke or dust in the
07:05
air
07:06
then it's not clear it's dirty you can't
07:08
see through it
07:09
but something that you can see through
07:11
is clear
07:12
you can see wow you can really see far
07:15
and you can see
07:16
very well because it's clear whether
07:18
it's
07:19
glass whether it's air water can be
07:22
clear you can see very
07:24
clearly through water so these things
07:27
are clear
07:28
okay number seven
07:31
this is an interesting picture it looks
07:33
like they're at the north pole or maybe
07:34
the south pole
07:36
they're uh in a boat and they're looking
07:38
around to look around
07:40
and discover especially people who go
07:43
someplace for the first time right it's
07:46
hard to discover
07:47
new places in the world these days
07:50
because
07:51
most places have already been discovered
07:54
what do we call that if you're going to
07:56
explore something
07:58
you're discovering something explore and
08:00
then of course the person who does this
08:03
is an explorer
08:07
and explorer a hundred years ago
08:10
there were many explorers a hundred
08:12
hundred fifty years ago
08:14
there were many explorers who explored
08:16
different parts of the world and
08:18
discovered many new things
08:20
okay next one eight not moving much
08:24
if there's a leaf on the water and the

11:58
they're going across the street okay i
12:01
just use the word there
12:02
from one side to the other side if
12:04
you're talking about
12:05
from one side to the other side let's
12:07
say you have a cliff here and there's a
12:08
river
12:09
there's another cliff okay and you build
12:12
a bridge
12:12

12:24
side
12:25
to the other from one side to the other
12:27
side this is a cross
12:29
this line goes across the street
12:33
be careful many students make a mistake
12:36
they say these children will across the
12:39
street
12:39
a cross is not a verb
12:42
these children are not acrossing the
12:45
street these children are
12:47
crossing the street
12:52
to cross the street
12:57
so if you are giving directions to
13:00
somebody
13:01
you say go to the intersection
13:04
then cross the street
13:07
cross is a verb don't say
13:11
across the street because that's not a
13:13
verb you can't tell
13:14
somebody to across the street across as
13:17
a preposition right
13:19
it means from one side to the other it's
13:22
not a verb
13:23
don't tell people to across the street
13:26
tell people to cross the street
13:29
you should cross the street here

this word and we make it a little bit
18:15
different
18:16
scientist scientist
18:19
people who study things you can use ist
18:23
very commonly scientist first let's
18:26
concentrate on this word
18:28
psy and tist how many sounds do you hear
18:32
psy and tist psy
18:35

people who study these sciences
19:28
okay okay let's
19:32
review the words let's do some word
19:34
vocabulary exercises
19:35
how well do you remember the words let's
19:37
go over them what we're doing is we're
19:39
going to use these words we have
19:41
four definitions right we want to write
19:44
the word
19:45
next to its meaning or its definition
19:48
these are our words first of all we have
19:53
imagine imagine
19:56
imagine that's the first word sale is
19:59
our second word
20:00
sale next mystery
20:04
mystery mystery mystery
20:08
so mystery and then we have calm
20:12
calm okay those are our four words we
20:14
need to match them
20:15
to our definitions number one a puzzle
20:19
or
20:19
secret something that you don't know
20:22
right we talked about this i don't know
20:24
it's a what is it it's a mystery
20:27
i hope that question was not a mystery
20:29
to you
20:30
you should know the answer right away
20:33
so it's not a mystery to you because we
20:35
studied that before
20:36
hopefully none of these questions are a
20:38
mystery to you okay
20:39
number two not moving much something
20:42
that doesn't move much
20:44
right it kind of stays in the same place
20:46
maybe moves a little bit
20:48
but not much doesn't move much it is
20:51
what
20:52
calm calm so a leaf on the water
20:56
