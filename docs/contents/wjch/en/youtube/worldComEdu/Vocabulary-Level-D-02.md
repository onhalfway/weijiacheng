in lesson one we talked about a cool
job that's being an architect well in
lesson two
let's take a look at some amazing
architecture
we're going to learn about famous
architecture
in the world we can think of famous
buildings or structures that were built
in history and that we remember do you
know some of them
let's go through some of the like
wonders of the world
famous buildings and structures for
example
do you know this one you probably do if
you've
ever read about egypt especially
ancient egypt you will know what
these structures are there's actually
two the first one here
is the great pyramid of giza
the great pyramid of giza giza is
a place in egypt where there are many
pyramids and these of course are tombs
where
the dead kings or pharaohs of the
egyptians
were put into these pyramids and of
course the other famous
structure is the sphinx the sphinx
which is also very famous okay
the next one is do you know this one of
course it's the eiffel
tower eiffel tower in paris
france whenever people think about
france or think of
pictures of france and especially paris
we usually think of the eiffel tower
it's a landmark a land
mark most of these buildings the
pyramids
the sphinx the eiffel tower these are
landmarks in seoul what is a famous
landmark
of course nam-san tower or now they call
it seoul tower
right so that is a famous landmark you
see it you say oh
i know where i am and i know that this
is famous
for being in this city so the eiffel
tower
is a famous landmark in paris
also very famous landmark in china many
people think about it
is the great wall built a long long time
ago hundreds of years ago
to keep the barbarians of the north out
of china
the great wall of china one of the
biggest
most impressive arc pieces of
architecture
in the world you can see it from space
wow okay the next one the south
faked the south kade
of the white house so in other words if
you look at the white house if you think
of washington d.c
the u.s government especially the
president
then we instantly recognize this image
because of the building this it's a
unique
style of building and this of course is
the
south side uh fakad or facade i'm sorry
facade
is the south side of a building and
that's the front entrance basically
okay next machu picchu
have you heard of machu picchu that name
sounds kind of funny right
that same sounds kind of cool this is a
very mysterious
city it's not just one building it was a
whole
city built out of stone all the people
disappeared
hundreds of years ago we're still
archaeologists
scientists are still trying to figure
out who were they why did they leave
what happened
we still don't know it's very mysterious
and of course this is in south america
it's machu picchu
on the top of a high mountain okay
the last one here is the taj mahal in
india maybe you've heard of this
this is very famous symbol for love
because a prince built this huge
building
because of his love for his
his lover the woman that he loved so he
built this
very beautiful building and it still
stands today
and it's a very big tourist attraction
and it's a symbol
of love the taj mahal in india
okay those are some examples of famous
architecture
in the world many of them are famous i'm
sure you've probably heard of them
before
but let's take a look now at
the vocabulary we're going to need in
order to read the passage
the first word that we're going to talk
about here is
defined as a structure a structure
some type of building could be small
could be big
a structure we put dead people in sounds
kind of funny
we put dead people in it but of course
when somebody dies
you know there's the question of what to
do with the
person's body after they've died right
in some cases they put them under the
ground they bury them underground
that would be a grave some people
they don't want their body to be put in
the ground they would want to be
burned right by fire and that's cremate
to cremate this is a great subject huh
very exciting subject but anyway graves
cremate but this is another
way another type of putting the dead
body
and this is called a tomb a tomb is
usually above ground
it's a small building like this it might
have a door
or it might not have a door but
sometimes it has a door you go in
and there are spaces for the different
uh bodies
usually a family like an important or
rich family
will have a tomb and they put their the
coffins
the bodies in different spaces on the
wall and the relatives or the
descendants can go
and visit the ancestors okay that's a
tomb
okay next word is something we store
things in of course you probably have
many of these your mom has
many of these in the refrigerator she
keeps food in them you store
something in them they're called
containers
and nowadays many containers are made of
plastic
of course containers can be made of
metal of wood
of all sorts of different materials but
most containers today
are made of plastic and we store we keep
things in those containers the next word
is to pull over the ground now they're
just playing
but sometimes if you see a mom the
little boy or girl
they don't want to go and mom's like
pulling them along the ground
what's going on she's dragging
the kid on the ground right so it's kind
of funny
to pull over the ground of course
they're just playing
pipes that carry water and other liquids
so in a house there are many pipes that
carry hot water
they carry cold water in a factory pipes
will carry lots of different types of
liquids what do we call those
we call that system of pipes plumbing
so really it's not just the pipes it's
the system
of pipes if you think about your house
okay if you think about your house you
have a kitchen sink
right you have a toilet those are all
different pipes
for water coming in and water coming out
if there's a problem
you say we have a problem with the
plumbing
you need to call somebody over a plumber
to fix it
okay next one whoa this guy's rich
right he's like uh he's uh he's like mr
scrooge but he has a lot of money
having a lot of money don't call him
scrooge
we can say he's rich right scrooge is a
specific meaning it means somebody who
doesn't like to spend money
but not all rich people are scrooges
some rich people like to spend their
money
right but just if you have a lot of
money
you are rich okay but we can be rich in
other things too you can be rich in love
you can be rich in
knowledge right so you can be rich in a
lot of different
things okay next one to make someone or
something
do what you want this is a it's like a
puppet
a puppet master
okay a puppet is a little doll that you
can control by strings
these would be the puppets and he's the
puppet master but this word that we're
looking for
the puppet master controls the puppets
he controls if you make somebody or
something
do what you want you are controlling
a person or a thing okay so that's to
control
now something made of many parts of
course a building is made of many
different parts
many machines are made of different
parts look at your computer
it has many different parts inside of it
it
is a structure even a computer can be a
type of structure
a building of course is obviously a type
of structure
it is something that is made of many
different parts it has many parts
to it made by people
this is very famous i think it's uh near
qatar or
near abu dhabi in the middle east very
famous i forgot exactly where this was
but they made the islands like this and
then they put houses on them
wow it's really cool so made by people
but it's not natural that's the point
here
this you're not sailing your boat you go
oh look
uh the island looks like a palm tree
it's not natural it didn't happen by
nature
it happened because it was man-made
people designed it they thought about it
they designed it
and they made it it's man-made our
experience our life on earth now we are
surrounded by
man-made things
three thousand years ago most of the
world was natural there weren't
many man-made things but nowadays we
live in
we live there are many man-made things
cities
resorts buildings everything in your
house
man-made okay a large
triangle-shaped building so we talked
about this before right
it's a triangle it means it has three
sides
right a triangle and it's shaped like a
triangle of course what did we call i'm
not talking about this
right i'm talking about this here a
large triangle-shaped building
is a pyramid and i talked about that
right we said the pyramids
of giza right not the sphinx the sphinx
is
separate it's there it's it's part of
the architecture
but um the pyramid is what we're talking
about here triangle
shaped building now to be around for a
period of time
he looks so happy doesn't he okay so to
be around for a period of time
is to last right he's thinking
how long is this lesson going to last i
hope you're not thinking that
i hope this is exciting but he's not
very excited about the lesson
he has a hinduro job right he has to
teach this
this young boy maybe math or something
like that but
how long is it going to last how long
will it be around
will it be around for one week one month
100 years how long will something
last how long will it last okay next one
a building where people practice
religion so of course many people
in the world are religious and there are
different religions there are different
buildings
uh one of those buildings is called a
church
people who are christian go to a church
people who are jewish go to a temple or
synagogue people who are muslim
they go to a mosque okay
so there are many different buildings
where people practice religion
this one we can see it's christian
because of the cross
so we call it a church but different
religions will call their buildings
different names this is for the
christian religion
okay a set of steps built between
two floors so if you have steps like
this
built between two floors what can we
call it we can call it stairs
and notice the s because there are many
of them
right so we always talk about it in the
plural because of course you have to
have many stairs
not just one if you had only one there
wouldn't be that wouldn't be stairs
right you'd have to jump up there
can you jump that high you can't so we
need a series we need
many steps we need many stairs
to go from one floor to the next floor
stairs
next one a passage built underground
of course in korea you can find many of
those in seoul there are many of these
you know korea has many mountains uh so
and the roads have to go you know
straight
but there's a mountain so you need to
make what through the mountain
you need to make a tunnel so you make a
tunnel
through the mountain so the road doesn't
have to go up you know and around and
it takes too long just go straight
through the mountain and make a tunnel
okay a large machine that moves dirt or
rock okay um what is this machine we
call it a bulldozer
but to tell you the truth this isn't
actually a bulldozer
i actually worked at a company where we
had where there were many machines like
this
when i was in america we call this
actually a front end loader
front end loader
a bulldozer has a big blade on the front
and it can move up and down but it
doesn't scoop up dirt a bulldozer
pushes dirt so a bulldozer is one of
those machines you see
that pushes dirt in front of it this is
a front end loader
it's used for scooping up dirt and
putting it into a big truck
but a large machine that moves dirt or
rock that would be a bulldozer it just
pushes it
out of the way okay something that makes
us wonder a lot of the things that we
saw before like the pyramids of giza the
eiffel tower
the taj mahal when we see those we go
wow
that's amazing how did people build that
right it makes us imagine
what people a long time ago how they
lived how they could do these types of
things
well not maybe not so much for the
eiffel tower but for the pyramid sure
and also for this one this is stonehedge
in england
something that makes us wonder we can
call it a
marvel it is a marvel right
and that's where the word marvelous
comes from
right ous by the way means full
of so if something is full of marvel
it is full of wonder right it is
marvel it is a marvel that's noun
adjective
it is marvelous you look marvelous
okay so for example okay next one
to make objects by cutting wood or stone
so there are some types of artists
that make works of art from
wood or stone what are they doing
they are carving they carve the wood
they carve the stone to make
beautiful marvelous shapes
okay so they carve you can carve soap be
careful with the knife right
be careful you can carve soap to make
little statues
okay but you can carve something to make
a piece of art okay now let's review the
words we just learned let's see how well
you remember that
with a exercise so let's take a look our
our instructions are here
choose the word that best completes the
sentence
so our words are here under each
sentence
and we need to fill in the blank with
one of these words
number one johnny exclamation
mark so i have to say johnny don't
beep your blanket in the dirt think
about little johnny he has a blanket
right the blanket should be clean but
what is he doing
he's doing something maybe he's walking
and the blanket
is in the dirt what's happening don't
control your blanket in the dirt that
doesn't make sense
don't drag a drag don't drag your
blanket in the dirt if you have a
blanket
right and you're not holding on to it
like this you just hold one end
and the other end is on the ground and
you're walking along
the blanket is dragging in the dirt and
it's getting
dirty mom doesn't like this don't do
that
okay so don't drag
your blanket in the dirt not don't run
that doesn't make sense
don't cut your blanket in the dirt why
would you cut your blanket
that doesn't make sense the best answer
is drag don't
drag your blanket in the dirt mom
doesn't like it it gets very dirty
okay number two we need a beep
for the rest of the food so imagine this
you're eating lunch
right but you're full ah pebble right i
can't eat anymore
right uh normal pebble uh so you have
but there's food left what are you gonna
do with it you're gonna throw it away
no that's wasteful you're gonna store it
and put it in the refrigerator what do
you put it in
we need something for the rest of the
food we need something to put the food
in what is it a structure a structure
like a small building
no we don't put it in a small building
do we need a container
yes that's what we talked about when i
said container
i said your mom probably has many
containers
in the refrigerator she keeps food in
them so we need a container
for the rest of the food do we need a
tomb
no don't keep your food in a tomb that's
weird
okay and church don't keep your food in
a church
i mean you can you might be able to eat
food in a church but that's kind of rude
don't do that they do eat one type of
food in the church but
that's a long story anyway
so the best word is of course container
we need a container for the rest of the
food you need something to store your
food in that's a container
okay number three my
uncle owns a jet airplane wow
the uncle is very he has a lot of money
if he has a jet airplane he has a lot of
money
what do we say a person who has a lot of
money he is so what he is so architect
doesn't make sense that's not correct
grammar anyway
he is so man-made that's just silly
his mom and his dad made him no that's
we don't say that
uh he is so rich because he owns a jet
airplane
like i said that costs a lot of money he
is so handsome
it doesn't matter if he's handsome or
ugly if he owns a plan anybody can own a
plane
it doesn't matter what they look like
what matters is how much money they have
you need a lot of money to own a jet
airplane
so he is so rich number four
this new car is hard to beep it is too
big
if you of course you don't drive but if
you have a small car a small car is easy
to drive you can turn it very quickly
but a big car it takes more power now
when you're driving it you know you have
to steer it
different places you have to try to what
you have to understand your car oh car i
understand you no we don't worry about
that it's a machine we don't worry about
understanding the car
um we need to sit it's hard to sit
you sit your car sit car no that's
strange the car is just a machine
it's hard to control okay that's the
answer because a big
car right you need a lot of power to
turn it
or to get it to go or to get it to stop
so that's the right answer
this new car is hard to control it's too
big
a big car is harder to control not hard
to look so the answer is this car is
hard to control
it is too big moving on number five
the toilet is broken when we talked
about this word i told
i talked about that said you have many
pipes coming in your house and going out
of your house your sink
your toilet we need new if the toilet is
broken
if those pipes are broken what do we
call that
system of pipes if you remember we
called it plumbing
we need new plumbing not bulldozers not
containers not churches
plumbing plumbing is the system of pipes
in your house
that controls your sink your toilet
that's about it
in your house your shower okay
six rob built a big what out of
wooden blocks he built what he built a
big
something he used wooden blocks to build
it
it's probably a structure because a
structure
is like a building you don't build
plumbing out of wooden blocks
wood does not make for good plumbing
right because it doesn't hold water very
well
it's very hard to shape wood
built a big man-made that's an adjective
not a noun
and dedication that doesn't fit that
doesn't make sense the best one of
course is
you build a structure a structure like i
said is a building it could be a small
building
it could be a large building okay so he
built a structure out of wooden blocks
now number seven when my grandfather
died
we built a what for his body remember we
talked about that that was our first
word
when somebody dies people think well
what to do with the body i talked about
three different ways
grave cremate or what was the last one
the last one was
tomb when my grandfather died we built a
tomb for his body and that's actually
the only answer because you don't build
a grave
you dig a grave you don't build a
cremate
you that doesn't make sense but a tomb
is like a structure
so you build a structure you build a
tomb so because of this
really the only possibility is tomb well
you wouldn't build a tunnel or an
apartment for a dead body
right you would build a tomb okay number
eight
the beep mountain isn't as big as a real
mountain
so think about that a real mountain in
this case
real can be natural okay so what's the
opposite of natural
the opposite of natural is man-made
okay so the man-made mountain isn't as
big as a real mountain
if you think about it people might make
a mountain
for some reason part of the neighborhood
part of a park but it's very difficult
to
make a mountain as big as a real or
natural mountain right
so the man-made mountain isn't as big as
a real
mountain okay that wraps up the
vocabulary section
of lesson two let's take a short break
we'll come back and take a look at the
reading
don't go away

04:32
okay those are some examples of famous
04:34
architecture
04:35
in the world many of them are famous i'm
04:38
sure you've probably heard of them
04:39
before
04:40
but let's take a look now at
04:43
the vocabulary we're going to need in
04:46
order to read the passage
04:48
the first word that we're going to talk
04:50
about here is
04:51
defined as a structure a structure
04:55
some type of building could be small
04:57
could be big
04:58
a structure we put dead people in sounds
05:01
kind of funny
05:02
we put dead people in it but of course
05:04
when somebody dies
05:06
you know there's the question of what to
05:08
do with the
05:09
person's body after they've died right
05:12
in some cases they put them under the
05:15
ground they bury them underground
05:16
that would be a grave some people
05:20
they don't want their body to be put in
05:22
the ground they would want to be
05:24
burned right by fire and that's cremate
05:27
to cremate this is a great subject huh
05:30
very exciting subject but anyway graves
05:33
cremate but this is another
05:35
way another type of putting the dead
05:38
body
05:38
and this is called a tomb a tomb is
05:41
usually above ground
05:42
it's a small building like this it might
05:44
have a door
05:45
or it might not have a door but
05:47
sometimes it has a door you go in
05:49
and there are spaces for the different
05:51
uh bodies
05:52
usually a family like an important or
05:55
rich family
05:56
will have a tomb and they put their the
05:58
coffins
05:59
the bodies in different spaces on the
06:01
wall and the relatives or the
06:03
descendants can go
06:05
and visit the ancestors okay that's a
06:08
tomb
06:09
okay next word is something we store
06:12
things in of course you probably have
06:14
many of these your mom has
06:16
many of these in the refrigerator she
06:18
keeps food in them you store
06:20
something in them they're called
06:22
containers
06:23
and nowadays many containers are made of
06:26
plastic
06:27
of course containers can be made of
06:28
metal of wood
06:30
of all sorts of different materials but
06:33
most containers today
06:34
are made of plastic and we store we keep
06:37
things in those containers the next word
06:41
is to pull over the ground now they're
06:43
just playing
06:44
but sometimes if you see a mom the
06:46
little boy or girl
06:47
they don't want to go and mom's like
06:49
pulling them along the ground
06:51
what's going on she's dragging
06:54
the kid on the ground right so it's kind
06:57
of funny
06:59
to pull over the ground of course
07:00
they're just playing
07:02
pipes that carry water and other liquids
07:05
so in a house there are many pipes that
07:08
carry hot water
07:09
they carry cold water in a factory pipes
07:12
will carry lots of different types of
07:14
liquids what do we call those
07:16
we call that system of pipes plumbing
07:19
so really it's not just the pipes it's
07:21
the system
07:22
of pipes if you think about your house
07:26
okay if you think about your house you
07:28
have a kitchen sink
07:30
right you have a toilet those are all
07:32
different pipes
07:34
for water coming in and water coming out
07:36
if there's a problem
07:37
you say we have a problem with the
07:39
plumbing
07:41
you need to call somebody over a plumber
07:43
to fix it
07:45
okay next one whoa this guy's rich
07:48
right he's like uh he's uh he's like mr
07:51
scrooge but he has a lot of money
07:53
having a lot of money don't call him
07:55
scrooge
07:56
we can say he's rich right scrooge is a
07:59
specific meaning it means somebody who
08:01
doesn't like to spend money
08:03
but not all rich people are scrooges
08:05
some rich people like to spend their
08:06
money
08:07
right but just if you have a lot of
08:10
money
08:10
you are rich okay but we can be rich in
08:14
other things too you can be rich in love
08:17
you can be rich in
08:18
knowledge right so you can be rich in a
08:20
lot of different
08:21
things okay next one to make someone or
08:25
something
08:26
do what you want this is a it's like a
08:29
puppet
08:29
a puppet master
08:33
okay a puppet is a little doll that you
08:36
can control by strings
08:37
these would be the puppets and he's the
08:39
puppet master but this word that we're
08:41
looking for
08:42
the puppet master controls the puppets
08:46
he controls if you make somebody or
08:48
something
08:49
do what you want you are controlling
08:52
a person or a thing okay so that's to
08:55
control
08:57
now something made of many parts of
08:59
course a building is made of many
09:01
different parts
09:02
many machines are made of different
09:04
parts look at your computer
09:06
it has many different parts inside of it
09:08
it
09:09
is a structure even a computer can be a
09:12
type of structure
09:13
a building of course is obviously a type
09:16
of structure
09:17
it is something that is made of many
09:19
different parts it has many parts
09:21
to it made by people
09:25
this is very famous i think it's uh near
09:28
qatar or
09:29
near abu dhabi in the middle east very
09:32
famous i forgot exactly where this was
09:34
but they made the islands like this and
09:36
then they put houses on them
09:38
wow it's really cool so made by people
09:41
but it's not natural that's the point
09:43
here
09:43
this you're not sailing your boat you go
09:46
oh look
09:47
uh the island looks like a palm tree
09:50
it's not natural it didn't happen by
09:52
nature
09:53
it happened because it was man-made
09:56
people designed it they thought about it
09:58
they designed it
09:59
and they made it it's man-made our
10:02
experience our life on earth now we are
10:05
surrounded by
10:05
man-made things
10:08
three thousand years ago most of the
10:10
world was natural there weren't
10:12
many man-made things but nowadays we
10:15
live in
10:15
we live there are many man-made things
10:17
cities
10:19
resorts buildings everything in your
10:22
house
10:22
man-made okay a large
10:26
triangle-shaped building so we talked
10:29
about this before right
10:30
it's a triangle it means it has three
10:32
sides
10:33
right a triangle and it's shaped like a
10:35
triangle of course what did we call i'm
10:37
not talking about this
10:38
right i'm talking about this here a
10:40
large triangle-shaped building
10:42
is a pyramid and i talked about that
10:45
right we said the pyramids
10:47
of giza right not the sphinx the sphinx
10:50
is
10:50
separate it's there it's it's part of
10:52
the architecture
10:53
but um the pyramid is what we're talking
10:56
about here triangle
10:57
shaped building now to be around for a
11:01
period of time
11:04
he looks so happy doesn't he okay so to
11:07
be around for a period of time
11:08
is to last right he's thinking
11:12
how long is this lesson going to last i
11:14
hope you're not thinking that
11:16
i hope this is exciting but he's not
11:18
very excited about the lesson
11:20
he has a hinduro job right he has to
11:23
teach this
11:23
this young boy maybe math or something
11:25
like that but
11:27
how long is it going to last how long
11:29
will it be around
11:31
will it be around for one week one month
11:34
100 years how long will something
11:37
last how long will it last okay next one
11:41
a building where people practice
11:43
religion so of course many people
11:45
in the world are religious and there are
11:47
different religions there are different
11:49
buildings
11:50
uh one of those buildings is called a
11:52
church
11:53
people who are christian go to a church
11:57
people who are jewish go to a temple or
12:00
synagogue people who are muslim
12:04
they go to a mosque okay
12:07
so there are many different buildings
12:09
where people practice religion
12:11
this one we can see it's christian
12:13
because of the cross
12:14
so we call it a church but different
12:17
religions will call their buildings
12:19
different names this is for the
12:21
christian religion
12:22
okay a set of steps built between
12:26
two floors so if you have steps like
12:29
this
12:29
built between two floors what can we
12:31
call it we can call it stairs
12:34
and notice the s because there are many
12:37
of them
12:38
right so we always talk about it in the
12:40
plural because of course you have to
12:42
have many stairs
12:43
not just one if you had only one there
12:46
wouldn't be that wouldn't be stairs
12:47
right you'd have to jump up there
12:49
can you jump that high you can't so we
12:51
need a series we need
12:53
many steps we need many stairs
12:56
to go from one floor to the next floor
12:59
stairs
13:00
next one a passage built underground
13:04
of course in korea you can find many of
13:06
those in seoul there are many of these
13:08
you know korea has many mountains uh so
13:11
and the roads have to go you know
13:13
straight
13:14
but there's a mountain so you need to
13:16
make what through the mountain
13:18
you need to make a tunnel so you make a
13:21
tunnel
13:21
through the mountain so the road doesn't
13:23
have to go up you know and around and
13:25
it takes too long just go straight
13:27
through the mountain and make a tunnel
13:29
okay a large machine that moves dirt or
13:34
rock okay um what is this machine we
13:37
call it a bulldozer
13:39
but to tell you the truth this isn't
13:41
actually a bulldozer
13:43
i actually worked at a company where we
13:45
had where there were many machines like
13:46
this
13:47
when i was in america we call this
13:49
actually a front end loader
13:51
front end loader
13:55
a bulldozer has a big blade on the front
13:58
and it can move up and down but it
14:00
doesn't scoop up dirt a bulldozer
14:02
pushes dirt so a bulldozer is one of
14:05
those machines you see
14:06
that pushes dirt in front of it this is
14:09
a front end loader
14:10
it's used for scooping up dirt and
14:12
putting it into a big truck
14:14
but a large machine that moves dirt or
14:17
rock that would be a bulldozer it just
14:19
pushes it
14:20
out of the way okay something that makes
14:24
us wonder a lot of the things that we
14:27
saw before like the pyramids of giza the
14:30
eiffel tower
14:31
the taj mahal when we see those we go
14:33
wow
14:34
that's amazing how did people build that
14:37
right it makes us imagine
14:41
what people a long time ago how they
14:43
lived how they could do these types of
14:44
things
14:45
well not maybe not so much for the
14:47
eiffel tower but for the pyramid sure
14:49
and also for this one this is stonehedge
14:51
in england
14:52
something that makes us wonder we can
14:54
call it a
14:56
marvel it is a marvel right
14:59
and that's where the word marvelous
15:01
comes from
15:02
right ous by the way means full
15:05
of so if something is full of marvel
15:09
it is full of wonder right it is
15:12
marvel it is a marvel that's noun
15:15
adjective
15:16
it is marvelous you look marvelous
15:19
okay so for example okay next one
15:22
to make objects by cutting wood or stone
15:26
so there are some types of artists
15:30
that make works of art from
15:33
wood or stone what are they doing
15:36
they are carving they carve the wood
15:40
they carve the stone to make
15:44
beautiful marvelous shapes
15:47
okay so they carve you can carve soap be
15:50
careful with the knife right
15:51
be careful you can carve soap to make
15:53
little statues
15:55
okay but you can carve something to make
15:58
a piece of art okay now let's review the
16:01
words we just learned let's see how well
16:03
you remember that
16:04
with a exercise so let's take a look our
16:06
our instructions are here
16:09
choose the word that best completes the
16:11
sentence
16:12
so our words are here under each
16:14
sentence
16:15
and we need to fill in the blank with
16:17
one of these words
16:18
number one johnny exclamation
16:22
mark so i have to say johnny don't
16:25
beep your blanket in the dirt think
16:28
about little johnny he has a blanket
16:30
right the blanket should be clean but
16:32
what is he doing
16:34
he's doing something maybe he's walking
16:36
and the blanket
16:37
is in the dirt what's happening don't
16:41
control your blanket in the dirt that
16:43
doesn't make sense
16:45
don't drag a drag don't drag your
16:48
blanket in the dirt if you have a
16:50
blanket
16:51
right and you're not holding on to it
16:53
like this you just hold one end
16:55
and the other end is on the ground and
16:57
you're walking along
16:59
the blanket is dragging in the dirt and
17:01
it's getting
17:02
dirty mom doesn't like this don't do
17:04
that
17:05
okay so don't drag
17:08
your blanket in the dirt not don't run
17:11
that doesn't make sense
17:12
don't cut your blanket in the dirt why
17:14
would you cut your blanket
17:15
that doesn't make sense the best answer
17:17
is drag don't
17:19
drag your blanket in the dirt mom
17:22
doesn't like it it gets very dirty
17:24
okay number two we need a beep
17:27
for the rest of the food so imagine this
17:31
you're eating lunch
17:32
right but you're full ah pebble right i
17:35
can't eat anymore
17:36
right uh normal pebble uh so you have
17:39
but there's food left what are you gonna
17:40
do with it you're gonna throw it away
17:42
no that's wasteful you're gonna store it
17:47
and put it in the refrigerator what do
17:49
you put it in
17:50
we need something for the rest of the
17:52
food we need something to put the food
17:54
in what is it a structure a structure
17:57
like a small building
17:58
no we don't put it in a small building
18:01
do we need a container
18:02
yes that's what we talked about when i
18:05
said container
18:06
i said your mom probably has many
18:08
containers
18:09
in the refrigerator she keeps food in
18:12
them so we need a container
18:14
for the rest of the food do we need a
18:16
tomb
18:17
no don't keep your food in a tomb that's
18:20
weird
18:20
okay and church don't keep your food in
18:24
a church
18:25
i mean you can you might be able to eat
18:26
food in a church but that's kind of rude
18:28
don't do that they do eat one type of
18:30
food in the church but
18:31
that's a long story anyway
18:34
so the best word is of course container
18:36
we need a container for the rest of the
18:39
food you need something to store your
18:41
food in that's a container
18:42
okay number three my
18:46
uncle owns a jet airplane wow
18:49
the uncle is very he has a lot of money
18:52
if he has a jet airplane he has a lot of
18:56
money
18:56
what do we say a person who has a lot of
18:58
money he is so what he is so architect
19:01
doesn't make sense that's not correct
19:03
grammar anyway
19:04
he is so man-made that's just silly
19:07
his mom and his dad made him no that's
19:09
we don't say that
19:10
uh he is so rich because he owns a jet
19:14
airplane
19:15
like i said that costs a lot of money he
19:17
is so handsome
19:18
it doesn't matter if he's handsome or
19:20
ugly if he owns a plan anybody can own a
19:22
plane
19:23
it doesn't matter what they look like
19:25
what matters is how much money they have
19:27
you need a lot of money to own a jet
19:30
airplane
19:30
so he is so rich number four
19:34
this new car is hard to beep it is too
19:37
big
19:38
if you of course you don't drive but if
19:40
you have a small car a small car is easy
19:42
to drive you can turn it very quickly
19:44
but a big car it takes more power now
19:46
when you're driving it you know you have
19:48
to steer it
19:49
different places you have to try to what
19:52
you have to understand your car oh car i
19:55
understand you no we don't worry about
19:56
that it's a machine we don't worry about
19:58
understanding the car
19:59
um we need to sit it's hard to sit
20:03
you sit your car sit car no that's
20:05
strange the car is just a machine
20:07
it's hard to control okay that's the
20:10
answer because a big
20:11
car right you need a lot of power to
20:13
turn it
20:14
or to get it to go or to get it to stop
20:16
so that's the right answer
20:18
this new car is hard to control it's too
20:21
big
20:21
a big car is harder to control not hard
20:24
to look so the answer is this car is
20:26
hard to control
20:27
it is too big moving on number five
20:31
the toilet is broken when we talked
20:34
about this word i told
20:35
i talked about that said you have many
20:37
pipes coming in your house and going out
20:39
of your house your sink
20:40
your toilet we need new if the toilet is
20:44
broken
20:45
if those pipes are broken what do we
20:47
call that
20:48
system of pipes if you remember we
20:50
called it plumbing
20:51
we need new plumbing not bulldozers not
20:54
containers not churches
20:55
plumbing plumbing is the system of pipes
20:58
in your house
20:59
that controls your sink your toilet
21:02
that's about it
21:03
in your house your shower okay
21:06
six rob built a big what out of
21:09
wooden blocks he built what he built a
21:12
big
21:13
something he used wooden blocks to build
21:16
it
21:17
it's probably a structure because a
21:19
structure
21:20
is like a building you don't build
21:22
plumbing out of wooden blocks
21:25
wood does not make for good plumbing
21:27
right because it doesn't hold water very
21:28
well
21:29
it's very hard to shape wood
21:32
built a big man-made that's an adjective
21:34
not a noun
21:36
and dedication that doesn't fit that
21:38
doesn't make sense the best one of
21:39
course is
21:40
you build a structure a structure like i
21:42
said is a building it could be a small
21:44
building
21:44
it could be a large building okay so he
21:47
built a structure out of wooden blocks
21:50
now number seven when my grandfather
21:54
died
21:54
we built a what for his body remember we
21:58
talked about that that was our first
21:59
word
22:00
when somebody dies people think well
22:01
what to do with the body i talked about
22:03
three different ways
22:04
grave cremate or what was the last one
22:07
the last one was
22:08
tomb when my grandfather died we built a
22:12
tomb for his body and that's actually
22:14
the only answer because you don't build
22:16
a grave
22:16
you dig a grave you don't build a
22:19
cremate
22:19
you that doesn't make sense but a tomb
22:22
is like a structure
22:23
so you build a structure you build a
22:25
tomb so because of this
22:27
really the only possibility is tomb well
22:31
you wouldn't build a tunnel or an
22:32
apartment for a dead body
22:34
right you would build a tomb okay number
22:37
eight
22:38
the beep mountain isn't as big as a real
22:41
mountain
22:42
so think about that a real mountain in
22:45
this case
22:45
real can be natural okay so what's the
22:48
opposite of natural
22:49
the opposite of natural is man-made
22:53
okay so the man-made mountain isn't as
22:56
big as a real mountain
22:57
if you think about it people might make
22:59
a mountain
23:01
for some reason part of the neighborhood
23:02
