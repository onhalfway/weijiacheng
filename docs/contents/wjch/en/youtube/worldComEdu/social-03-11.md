hello everyone
welcome back to american textbook
reading
today we're going over social studies
book 3
lesson 11 and we're continuing the theme
of
world of work and money in this lesson
we're talking about
from farm to you from the farm
to you so in this lesson we will
discover
different kinds of resources
and we will also discover how apples go
from a tree to your mouth oh interesting
okay
so let's take a look first as always we
start with the vocabulary so let's learn
some new words
the first word is actually two words
right the first expression
is two words and it's human
resources human resources
that sounds a little strange doesn't it
we're going to
use humans as resources but it's not
that strange
when you think about it many different
people have different skills or
different
talents and we want to be able to use
those skills or talents to help other
people
so that's what it's meant by human
resources right
people's skills and abilities i said
talents ability is the same as talent
so you could also say their talents
you are talented you have certain
abilities
that you're good at certain skills that
you're good at those are your
talents right that a company or
organization can
use and of course in a company or
organization there is a
human resources department
and in that department those workers
are interested in how to best use
the skills and talents of the people at
the company
so that's what they're doing that's what
they should be doing okay good human
resources
okay next we have capital resources
capital resources
what are those in economic terms
capital usually means money but in this
case
the capital resources mean things like
tools tools like a screwdriver or a
hammer
right machines actually machines are a
type of
tool right they're a big piece of
machinery
that does some action like robots robots
are machines
and buildings buildings are also capital
resources
which you need to produce goods actually
we can also call these things
assets asset as a-s-s-e-t-s
assets are things that a company
owns and they're they're another form of
money because you can sell these things
and get money for them so
capital capital usually means money when
you're talking about business
capital investment capital resources
these are things that the company has
that are that's worth something it's
worth a certain amount of money
so capital resources are basically
tools and tools machines buildings are
all types of tools
they're things that allow or help the
company to
produce or to make products
okay an orchard
now we've left like the industrial world
and we've gone
out into the countryside okay so an
orchard
and orchard is an area in the
countryside
it's an open area it's like a field
where people grow
fruit trees now when you think about
food there's a lot of different
vocabulary
words that you can use for different
types of growing
food you can say a field for
when when people grow corn or wheat we
just call that a field
but if you grow apples or oranges
those types of fruit that grow on trees
we call those areas an
orchard so an orchard is a place where
trees grow
and the trees stay there right a wheat
field you cut down the the whole plant
but an orchard don't cut down the trees
the farmers will get very angry right so
so the
trees stay there but they produce fruit
every year
it's an open area where people grow
fruit
trees and many different types of fruit
that's an
orchard irrigation
well whether it's an orchard or a field
the farmer needs to get
water to those plants because of course
plants need
water to live every living thing needs
water so how do they get water to an
area
especially if it's not raining will they
set up an irrigation
system and irrigation is just means
watering land through pipes to help
crops grow a long time ago people would
dig
like these long trenches and they would
get the river
a nearby river or stream to go through
the trenches in their fields
but with modern technology we can use
pipes
to carry the water into the field and we
can you know have little
other tools that spray the water over
the plants or just holes in the pipe
that will drip the water out into the
field so that the plants get the water
they need to grow
sort now sort here is a verb
right to sort to sort
let's imagine that you have a lot of
toys
in your bedroom at home you have marbles
you have
little action figures and maybe you have
some games
well they're different kinds right so
you're going to sort them you're going
to put all the marbles together that's
one kind
you're going to put all your action
figures together that's one kind you put
all your games
in one kind if they're all mixed up you
know you separate them
and put them in different groups that
action
separating into different groups is to
sort
to arrange things in groups according to
their kinds
so marbles over here action figures over
here
games over here you have sorted your
toys
in this case we can sort you can sort
apples and
it looks like a factory maybe there are
some humans also
working there and basically what they're
doing is they're picking out like a good
apple
or the right color of apple and they're
putting them over here
and then the lower quality apples
they're putting over there so they're
separating the apples
according to maybe size color
whether they're damaged or not and
they're sorting those
goods okay next word is
ship now ship can be a noun but it can
also be a verb
right you can think of a big ship right
this looks like a big ship it's a
cargo ship it is a cargo ship it's a
really big ship
but ship can also be a verb to
ship i want to ship something to you
that means i go to the post office put
the thing in a package
and send it to you that is to ship
to send something by ship
or another vehicle if i send something
to you
right you live in another country and i
don't want to pay a lot of money sorry
and it doesn't matter that it takes a
long time it will i
go to the post office and give it to
them and say it's okay it takes a month
that's okay it might take they might use
a ship to get it to you but if i say no
it's very urgent
your birthday is tomorrow i want you to
get it quickly
then it will be shipped by plane
right so you can have air shipment or
a ground shipment okay good
ripe when something is ripe it is
fully grown and ready to eat or to
harvest there's a difference between
those i'll talk about
but think about an apple right if you go
out in the orchard in the springtime you
look at the apple trees
there's no apples where are the apples
well after a little while the flowers
start to grow right
and the flowers might turn into little
buds and they
they're little tiny apples don't eat
those ugh they're terrible right
you have to wait until the apple is
fully grown and it changes color
right into like bright red or sometimes
green a lot of green apples
and when that apple looks great when it
looks like it's really ready to eat
then it is ripe it is ready to eat
or to harvest what does harvest mean
harvest means that you go
to the orchard or to the field and you
take
the ripe fruit or vegetables and you
collect it you don't eat it
right because first of all you can't eat
all of that that's too much oh my gosh
besides the other problem is that you
want to sell it right you don't want to
you don't eat it all because then you
don't make any money
so you want to harvest it you want to
gather it together in
bushels and then you ship it to the
marketplace
and that's where you sell it so harvest
just means to gather
when something is ready to gather it up
okay
load now i just talked about harvest
right you gather all the things together
you put them into baskets and then you
put them onto a truck
you load it onto a truck so load
means to put something or someone
on vehicles right so if you have a baby
brother or a baby sister
your parents will load your baby brother
or sister into the back
seat you'll put the seat belt on when
you go on a trip
so they will load your baby brother or
sister into a vehicle
they i hope your parents don't load you
into the vehicle you can get in the
vehicle by yourself
okay so they don't need to load you in
but if you want to put
things into a a car or a vehicle like
your groceries you go to the store and
you help mom
put the groceries into the car you're
loading
the groceries into your car
of course it's also companies do this a
lot too
when they transport goods when they ship
goods
from one area to another okay
that is our vocabulary section for today
a lot of interesting words
okay let's go over a couple of main
ideas for this lesson
the first idea is a journey of apples
hmm
sounds like a novel right sounds like a
very interesting story well it is an
interesting story
let's take a look how does the apple go
from the tree to your mouth
right well first you want to grow the
apples we have growing apples and where
do apples grow
they grow in an orchard
yes good they grow in an orchard in an
orchard there are many trees and the
apples grow
and we talked about the process of
apples growing now when the apples are
ripe the farmers and helpers of the
farmer
they get together what do they do they
don't eat all the apples they eat maybe
eat some of the apples
but they harvest they pick the apples
and they put them into baskets that's to
harvest they harvest the apples
then they send the apples to a factory
and in the factory the apples are sorted
you know sometimes birds get to the
apples and they they pick pieces out or
worms or
insects get inside the apple you don't
want those apples to go to the
supermarket
so those apples are sorted out right and
if apples
if some of them fell down and they're
bruised you don't want to send those to
the store
so you sort the apples the good apples
and the bad apples
bad apples okay the next thing you do is
you process the apples now
sometimes the apple doesn't come in
in you know the original or raw state to
your
to your uh to your store or to your
refrigerator
sometimes people will use the apples to
make other products like drinks
apple juice or maybe apple pie
right so you there needs to be a
processing
of the apples so another factory will
take
the apples and they will process process
means to change
a raw material into a finished good
so process to process
in this case means to
change from
raw to finished
product finished product to finished
yeah
finished product a finished product
is something that has been changed from
the raw state
into a more complicated or refined
state for consumption remember in the
last lesson we talked about consumers
consumers consume things that's
consumption so they take the apples
the raw apples and they'll change it
they may combine it with other things or
they may make it more pure
in this case it looks like they're
making apple juice so they change the
apples they get the juice out of it
they put it in a plastic bottle and that
is the product
so then they have their product what do
they do with it well they load it onto
trucks
to ship it and remember ship can be like
a ship a boat
but ship can also be by by ship by
airplane or by truck or by car
it's transported from one place to
another in this case by truck
and it where does it go it goes to the
supermarket or marketplace and it's sold
in a store and then finally you come
along
and you buy it and it goes into your
mouth
okay so there's a journey of an apple
from the tree
to your mouth okay or maybe it's in your
refrigerator now but it will soon be in
your mouth
okay good so apple juice is good apple
products are good
raw apples are probably the best most
healthy but a lot of
other products are also made from apples
okay
next let's talk about three kinds of
resources
we talked about two in the vocabulary
section we talked about
human resources human resources are the
abilities and talents of
human beings and there are many
there are many abilities everybody has
their own certain abilities or their own
certain talents
when you grow you will develop your
abilities or your talents
to do a specific thing hopefully it's
something
find the ability that you like doing
find the talent that you
enjoy and pursue that and that's the
best choice for you
but there are office workers people who
are good at using computers or analyzing
data you know figuring things out
the office worker will use their
abilities or talents
for that type of work and that's a type
of human resource
other people might enjoy or be better at
working with their hands or working with
machinery
they could be machine operators right
they like
looking at machinery and figuring out
how it works or something
robotics is an interesting field that's
coming up
maybe you will work with robots in the
future
you could be like a machine operator or
a robot operator which would be
interesting so those are different types
of
human resources next we have
capital resources and as i explained
before
capital resources are machines tools
assets that a company uses in order to
produce a good
now one other type of resource that we
didn't go over in the vocabulary section
but it's very important we kind of
talked about it
and those are natural resources
right we talked about an orchard right
we talked about
apple trees apple trees trees that grow
in nature
that's a natural resource yes the farmer
changes it a little bit they might plant
the trees in a row
and give water through irrigation that's
true
but it's really a natural resource now
some other natural resources
are for example a forest what do we get
from a forest well we get wood from
trees
and that is a resource that we use to
make furniture to make houses
to make many things it's important
though to protect our natural resources
we shouldn't cut down all the trees so
many companies that own
land and they're called logging
companies they will cut the trees down
but they won't cut all the trees down
they'll only cut
a few trees here and there so that the
forest still
is surviving and new trees will grow
in the place of the trees that are cut
down that is smart
use of the natural resources another
natural resource we may not think about
it
it's water clean water is an important
natural resource and it's important that
we make sure
that it stays clean the water i'm
talking about the water in streams
in rivers in lakes not the water in the
ocean
can't drink it look tastes horrible
right it's very important
right it's important that the sea water
stays clean for fish and other things
those are other natural resources but
when we talk about water we usually mean
clean water water that is safe to drink
we have to make sure that it stays clean
it's not polluted
okay so those are types of natural
resources so three types
are three kinds of resources human
resources
capital resources and natural resources
okay very good now it's time for the
reading
section let's see how those words that
we learned in the vocabulary and the
ideas that we
discussed fit into the reading passage
as always as i read please go ahead and
read along with me
or read along in your mind practice the
pronunciation
and focus on the key vocabulary that we
learned
are you ready let's begin
where do the apples and other fruit that
you enjoy
come from they usually come
from orchards human resources
capital resources and natural resources
are important in bringing delicious
apples
into your home people in the orchard
are human resources that help to grow
the apples
capital resources like machines help
people produce apples faster
machines are used to grow and transport
the apples
irrigation keeps the apples delicious
and healthy until they are ripe
the water used during irrigation
is a kind of natural resource
when the apples are ripe they are picked
and sorted into healthy and
unhealthy apples
they are then loaded into trucks ships
or planes and shipped from the orchard
to markets all over the world
now you can buy the fresh apples
at the supermarket okay let's discuss
how this reading passage was organized
in this case we're looking at the
reading skill classify
classify means to put things into
different groups
it's kind of like sorting right so you
sort different ideas or different
details
into different groups and in this case
we have three groups
remember the idea we talked about the
different types of resources
so we can sort resources into different
groups we can
classify them we have human resources
we have capital resources and we have
natural resources
and over on the right side we have
examples of
each one so what are human resources
from the passage we saw that farmers
grow apples in the orchard so
farmers or gatherers in the orchard i'll
just put farmers here
farmers because that's easy
farmers are human resources well
their humans and their skills are
resources
farmers in the orchard are an example of
human resources
capital resources what's an example well
what helped
people produce apples remember sorting
the good apples from the bad apples
of course machines are used to do that
machines machines
machine oops sorry that's an s machines
that help
people produce apples so those are
capital resources so that is an example
of capital resources finally natural
resources we talked about this this is a
very
important type of natural resource that
is clean water
i'll just put water here water
water it should be clean of course you
don't want dirty water in your fields
water used during irrigation is a
natural
resource that has helped to keep the app
that helps
keep the apples healthy and delicious of
course too
there's not enough water maybe the
apples aren't delicious so you have to
have the right amount of
water okay so those are different types
of resources
that we can see in the reading section
and of course resources are very
important
for us they're very important for our
life and again i'll say it again because
it's very important
we must protect our natural resources
human resources
as long as there are human beings we
have many different human resources
we have to develop them of course
through education capital resources
we develop our capital resources through
increasing technology
now natural resources have always been
there we don't need to develop them
but we need to protect them so that
future generations
can use them and have and that they have
good access to these natural resources
okay
well that wraps up this lesson i hope it
was interesting hope you learned a lot
of interesting things and that
it helped with your english study thanks
for standing with me as always
and we'll see you in the next lesson
take care everybody bye bye
you

hello everyone
00:09
welcome back to american textbook
00:12
reading
00:12
today we're going over social studies
00:14
book 3
00:16
lesson 11 and we're continuing the theme
00:19
of
00:19
world of work and money in this lesson
00:22
we're talking about
00:23
from farm to you from the farm
00:27
to you so in this lesson we will
00:30
discover
00:31
different kinds of resources
00:34
and we will also discover how apples go
00:37
from a tree to your mouth oh interesting
00:41
okay
00:42
so let's take a look first as always we
00:45
start with the vocabulary so let's learn
00:48
some new words
00:49
the first word is actually two words
00:51
right the first expression
00:53
is two words and it's human
00:57
resources human resources
01:00
that sounds a little strange doesn't it
01:03
we're going to
01:03
use humans as resources but it's not
01:07
that strange
01:08
when you think about it many different
01:10
people have different skills or
01:12
different
01:12
talents and we want to be able to use
01:15
those skills or talents to help other
01:17
people
01:18
so that's what it's meant by human
01:20
resources right
01:21
people's skills and abilities i said
01:25
talents ability is the same as talent
01:29
so you could also say their talents
01:32
you are talented you have certain
01:34
abilities
01:36
that you're good at certain skills that
01:38
you're good at those are your
01:39
talents right that a company or
01:42
organization can
01:43
use and of course in a company or
01:46
organization there is a
01:48
human resources department
01:51
and in that department those workers
01:55
are interested in how to best use
01:59
the skills and talents of the people at
02:02
the company
02:03
so that's what they're doing that's what
02:04
they should be doing okay good human
02:06
resources
02:08
okay next we have capital resources
02:10
capital resources
02:12
what are those in economic terms
02:15
capital usually means money but in this
02:18
case
02:19
the capital resources mean things like
02:22
tools tools like a screwdriver or a
02:25
hammer
02:26
right machines actually machines are a
02:30
type of
02:30
tool right they're a big piece of
02:33
machinery
02:33
that does some action like robots robots
02:36
are machines
02:37
and buildings buildings are also capital
02:41
resources
02:42
which you need to produce goods actually
02:45
we can also call these things
02:47
assets asset as a-s-s-e-t-s
02:52
assets are things that a company
02:55
owns and they're they're another form of
02:59
money because you can sell these things
03:01
and get money for them so
03:02
capital capital usually means money when
03:05
you're talking about business
03:07
capital investment capital resources
03:09
these are things that the company has
03:11
that are that's worth something it's
03:14
worth a certain amount of money
03:16
so capital resources are basically
03:19
tools and tools machines buildings are
03:21
all types of tools
03:22
they're things that allow or help the
03:24
company to
03:26
produce or to make products
03:29
okay an orchard
03:32
now we've left like the industrial world
03:35
and we've gone
03:36
out into the countryside okay so an
03:39
orchard
03:40
and orchard is an area in the
03:42
countryside
03:43
it's an open area it's like a field
03:46
where people grow
03:47
fruit trees now when you think about
03:50
food there's a lot of different
03:53
vocabulary
03:55
words that you can use for different
03:57
types of growing
03:59
food you can say a field for
04:02
when when people grow corn or wheat we
04:05
just call that a field
04:06
but if you grow apples or oranges
04:11
those types of fruit that grow on trees
04:13
we call those areas an
04:15
orchard so an orchard is a place where
04:17
trees grow
04:18
and the trees stay there right a wheat
04:20
field you cut down the the whole plant
04:22
but an orchard don't cut down the trees
04:24
the farmers will get very angry right so
04:27
so the
04:28
trees stay there but they produce fruit
04:30
every year
04:31
it's an open area where people grow
04:33
fruit
04:34
trees and many different types of fruit
04:36
that's an
04:37
orchard irrigation
04:40
well whether it's an orchard or a field
04:43
the farmer needs to get
04:45
water to those plants because of course
04:48
plants need
04:48
water to live every living thing needs
04:52
water so how do they get water to an
04:54
area
04:55
especially if it's not raining will they
04:57
set up an irrigation
04:59
system and irrigation is just means
05:02
watering land through pipes to help
05:05
crops grow a long time ago people would
05:09
dig
05:10
like these long trenches and they would
05:13
get the river
05:14
a nearby river or stream to go through
05:16
the trenches in their fields
05:18
but with modern technology we can use
05:20
pipes
05:21
to carry the water into the field and we
05:24
can you know have little
05:26
other tools that spray the water over
05:28
the plants or just holes in the pipe
05:30
that will drip the water out into the
05:33
field so that the plants get the water
05:35
they need to grow
05:39
sort now sort here is a verb
05:43
right to sort to sort
05:46
let's imagine that you have a lot of
05:48
toys
05:49
in your bedroom at home you have marbles
05:52
you have
05:53
little action figures and maybe you have
05:56
some games
05:57
well they're different kinds right so
05:59
you're going to sort them you're going
06:00
to put all the marbles together that's
06:02
one kind
06:03
you're going to put all your action
06:04
figures together that's one kind you put
06:06
all your games
06:07
in one kind if they're all mixed up you
06:09
know you separate them
06:10
and put them in different groups that
06:13
action
06:14
separating into different groups is to
06:16
sort
06:17
to arrange things in groups according to
06:21
their kinds
06:22
so marbles over here action figures over
06:24
here
06:25
games over here you have sorted your
06:28
toys
06:29
in this case we can sort you can sort
06:31
apples and
06:33
it looks like a factory maybe there are
06:35
some humans also
06:36
working there and basically what they're
06:38
doing is they're picking out like a good
06:40
apple
06:40
or the right color of apple and they're
06:43
putting them over here
06:45
and then the lower quality apples
06:47
they're putting over there so they're
06:48
separating the apples
06:50
according to maybe size color
06:53
whether they're damaged or not and
06:55
they're sorting those
06:57
goods okay next word is
07:01
ship now ship can be a noun but it can
07:04
also be a verb
07:05
right you can think of a big ship right
07:07
this looks like a big ship it's a
07:09
cargo ship it is a cargo ship it's a
07:12
really big ship
07:14
but ship can also be a verb to
07:17
ship i want to ship something to you
07:20
that means i go to the post office put
07:23
the thing in a package
07:24
and send it to you that is to ship
07:28
to send something by ship
07:31
or another vehicle if i send something
07:33
to you
07:34
right you live in another country and i
07:36
don't want to pay a lot of money sorry
07:38
and it doesn't matter that it takes a
07:40
long time it will i
07:41
go to the post office and give it to
07:43
them and say it's okay it takes a month
07:45
that's okay it might take they might use
07:48
a ship to get it to you but if i say no
07:50
it's very urgent
07:51
your birthday is tomorrow i want you to
07:53
get it quickly
07:54
then it will be shipped by plane
07:57
right so you can have air shipment or
08:00
a ground shipment okay good
08:05
ripe when something is ripe it is
08:08
fully grown and ready to eat or to
08:11
harvest there's a difference between
08:13
those i'll talk about
08:14
but think about an apple right if you go
08:16
out in the orchard in the springtime you
08:18
look at the apple trees
08:19
there's no apples where are the apples
08:21
well after a little while the flowers
08:23
start to grow right
08:24
and the flowers might turn into little
08:27
buds and they
08:28
they're little tiny apples don't eat
08:30
those ugh they're terrible right
08:32
you have to wait until the apple is
08:33
fully grown and it changes color
08:36
right into like bright red or sometimes
08:39
green a lot of green apples
08:40
and when that apple looks great when it
08:42
looks like it's really ready to eat
08:44
then it is ripe it is ready to eat
08:48
or to harvest what does harvest mean
08:51
harvest means that you go
08:54
to the orchard or to the field and you
08:57
take
08:58
the ripe fruit or vegetables and you
09:01
collect it you don't eat it
09:02
right because first of all you can't eat
09:04
all of that that's too much oh my gosh
09:06
besides the other problem is that you
09:08
want to sell it right you don't want to
09:10
you don't eat it all because then you
09:11
don't make any money
09:12
so you want to harvest it you want to
09:14
gather it together in
09:15
bushels and then you ship it to the
09:18
marketplace
09:19
and that's where you sell it so harvest
09:21
just means to gather
09:22
when something is ready to gather it up
09:25
okay
09:27
load now i just talked about harvest
09:29
right you gather all the things together
09:31
you put them into baskets and then you
09:33
put them onto a truck
09:34
you load it onto a truck so load
09:38
means to put something or someone
09:41
on vehicles right so if you have a baby
09:44
brother or a baby sister
09:46
your parents will load your baby brother
09:48
or sister into the back
09:50
seat you'll put the seat belt on when
09:52
you go on a trip
09:53
so they will load your baby brother or
09:55
sister into a vehicle
09:57
they i hope your parents don't load you
09:59
into the vehicle you can get in the
10:01
vehicle by yourself
10:03
okay so they don't need to load you in
10:05
but if you want to put
10:06
things into a a car or a vehicle like
10:08
your groceries you go to the store and
10:10
you help mom
10:11
put the groceries into the car you're
10:13
loading
10:14
the groceries into your car
10:17
of course it's also companies do this a
10:20
lot too
10:20
when they transport goods when they ship
10:23
goods
10:23
from one area to another okay
10:27
that is our vocabulary section for today
10:30
a lot of interesting words
10:33
okay let's go over a couple of main
10:34
ideas for this lesson
10:36
the first idea is a journey of apples
10:39
hmm
10:39
sounds like a novel right sounds like a
10:41
very interesting story well it is an
10:43
interesting story
10:45
let's take a look how does the apple go
10:46
from the tree to your mouth
10:49
right well first you want to grow the
10:52
apples we have growing apples and where
10:53
do apples grow
10:55
they grow in an orchard
10:58
yes good they grow in an orchard in an
11:00
orchard there are many trees and the
11:02
apples grow
11:03
and we talked about the process of
11:05
apples growing now when the apples are
11:07
ripe the farmers and helpers of the
11:10
farmer
11:11
they get together what do they do they
11:12
don't eat all the apples they eat maybe
11:14
eat some of the apples
11:15
but they harvest they pick the apples
11:19
and they put them into baskets that's to
11:21
harvest they harvest the apples
11:24
then they send the apples to a factory
11:27
and in the factory the apples are sorted
11:29
you know sometimes birds get to the
11:31
apples and they they pick pieces out or
11:34
worms or
11:34
insects get inside the apple you don't
11:37
want those apples to go to the
11:38
supermarket
11:39
so those apples are sorted out right and
11:42
if apples
11:43
if some of them fell down and they're
11:44
bruised you don't want to send those to
11:46
the store
11:47
so you sort the apples the good apples
11:49
and the bad apples
11:51
bad apples okay the next thing you do is
11:53
you process the apples now
11:55
sometimes the apple doesn't come in
11:59
in you know the original or raw state to
12:02
your
12:03
to your uh to your store or to your
12:06
refrigerator
12:07
sometimes people will use the apples to
12:09
make other products like drinks
12:11
apple juice or maybe apple pie
12:14
right so you there needs to be a
12:17
processing
12:18
of the apples so another factory will
12:21
take
12:22
the apples and they will process process
12:24
means to change
12:26
a raw material into a finished good
12:29
so process to process
12:32
in this case means to
12:36
change from
12:41
raw to finished
12:45
product finished product to finished
12:48
yeah
12:48
finished product a finished product
12:53
is something that has been changed from
12:55
the raw state
12:56
into a more complicated or refined
13:01
state for consumption remember in the
13:04
last lesson we talked about consumers
13:06
consumers consume things that's
13:08
consumption so they take the apples
13:10
the raw apples and they'll change it
13:13
they may combine it with other things or
13:15
they may make it more pure
13:16
in this case it looks like they're
13:18
making apple juice so they change the
13:20
apples they get the juice out of it
13:22
they put it in a plastic bottle and that
13:24
is the product
13:25
so then they have their product what do
13:27
they do with it well they load it onto
13:28
trucks
13:29
to ship it and remember ship can be like
13:32
a ship a boat
13:33
but ship can also be by by ship by
13:36
airplane or by truck or by car
13:39
it's transported from one place to
13:41
another in this case by truck
13:43
and it where does it go it goes to the
13:47
supermarket or marketplace and it's sold
13:50
in a store and then finally you come
13:53
along
13:53
and you buy it and it goes into your
13:56
mouth
13:57
okay so there's a journey of an apple
14:00
from the tree
14:00
to your mouth okay or maybe it's in your
14:03
refrigerator now but it will soon be in
14:05
your mouth
14:06
okay good so apple juice is good apple
14:09
products are good
14:10
raw apples are probably the best most
14:12
healthy but a lot of
14:13
other products are also made from apples
14:16
okay
14:17
next let's talk about three kinds of
14:20
resources
14:21
we talked about two in the vocabulary
14:23
section we talked about
14:24
human resources human resources are the
14:27
abilities and talents of
14:29
human beings and there are many
14:32
there are many abilities everybody has
14:34
their own certain abilities or their own
14:36
certain talents
14:37
when you grow you will develop your
14:39
abilities or your talents
14:41
to do a specific thing hopefully it's
14:44
something
14:45
find the ability that you like doing
14:47
find the talent that you
14:48
enjoy and pursue that and that's the
14:52
best choice for you
14:53
but there are office workers people who
14:55
are good at using computers or analyzing
14:58
data you know figuring things out
15:01
the office worker will use their
15:02
abilities or talents
15:04
for that type of work and that's a type
15:06
of human resource
15:08
other people might enjoy or be better at
15:11
working with their hands or working with
15:14
machinery
15:15
they could be machine operators right
15:17
they like
15:18
looking at machinery and figuring out
15:20
how it works or something
15:21
robotics is an interesting field that's
15:23
coming up
15:24
maybe you will work with robots in the
15:27
future
15:27
you could be like a machine operator or
15:29
a robot operator which would be
15:31
interesting so those are different types
15:33
of
15:33
human resources next we have
15:37
capital resources and as i explained
15:40
before
15:40
capital resources are machines tools
15:44
assets that a company uses in order to
15:47
produce a good
15:49
now one other type of resource that we
15:51
didn't go over in the vocabulary section
15:54
but it's very important we kind of
15:56
talked about it
15:57
and those are natural resources
16:00
right we talked about an orchard right
16:03
we talked about
16:03
apple trees apple trees trees that grow
16:06
in nature
16:07
that's a natural resource yes the farmer
16:10
changes it a little bit they might plant
16:13
the trees in a row
16:14
and give water through irrigation that's
16:17
true
16:18
but it's really a natural resource now
16:20
some other natural resources
16:22
are for example a forest what do we get
16:26
from a forest well we get wood from
16:28
trees
16:29
and that is a resource that we use to
16:32
make furniture to make houses
16:34
to make many things it's important
16:35
though to protect our natural resources
16:38
we shouldn't cut down all the trees so
16:41
many companies that own
16:42
land and they're called logging
16:44
companies they will cut the trees down
16:46
but they won't cut all the trees down
16:47
they'll only cut
16:48
a few trees here and there so that the
16:51
forest still
16:52
is surviving and new trees will grow
16:55
in the place of the trees that are cut
16:57
down that is smart
16:59
use of the natural resources another
17:02
natural resource we may not think about
17:04
it
17:04
it's water clean water is an important
17:08
natural resource and it's important that
17:10
we make sure
17:11
that it stays clean the water i'm
17:14
talking about the water in streams
17:15
in rivers in lakes not the water in the
17:19
ocean
17:20
can't drink it look tastes horrible
17:22
right it's very important
17:24
right it's important that the sea water
17:25
stays clean for fish and other things
17:27
those are other natural resources but
17:29
when we talk about water we usually mean
17:31
clean water water that is safe to drink
17:34
we have to make sure that it stays clean
17:36
it's not polluted
17:37
okay so those are types of natural
17:39
resources so three types
17:41
are three kinds of resources human
17:43
resources
17:44
capital resources and natural resources
17:48
okay very good now it's time for the
17:51
reading
17:51
section let's see how those words that
17:53
we learned in the vocabulary and the
17:55
ideas that we
17:56
discussed fit into the reading passage
18:00
as always as i read please go ahead and
18:03
read along with me
18:04
or read along in your mind practice the
18:06
pronunciation
18:08
and focus on the key vocabulary that we
18:11
learned
18:11
are you ready let's begin
18:15
where do the apples and other fruit that
18:18
you enjoy
18:19
come from they usually come
18:22
from orchards human resources
18:27
capital resources and natural resources
18:31
are important in bringing delicious
18:34
apples
18:35
into your home people in the orchard
18:39
are human resources that help to grow
18:42
the apples
18:46
capital resources like machines help
18:49
people produce apples faster
18:52
machines are used to grow and transport
18:56
the apples
19:00
irrigation keeps the apples delicious
19:03
and healthy until they are ripe
19:06
the water used during irrigation
19:09
is a kind of natural resource
19:14
when the apples are ripe they are picked
19:18
and sorted into healthy and
19:21
unhealthy apples
19:25
they are then loaded into trucks ships
19:29
or planes and shipped from the orchard
19:33
to markets all over the world
19:36
now you can buy the fresh apples
19:39
at the supermarket okay let's discuss
19:43
how this reading passage was organized
19:46
in this case we're looking at the
19:47
reading skill classify
19:49
classify means to put things into
19:52
different groups
19:53
it's kind of like sorting right so you
19:56
sort different ideas or different
19:59
details
20:00
into different groups and in this case
20:02
we have three groups
20:03
remember the idea we talked about the
20:06
different types of resources
20:08
so we can sort resources into different
20:12
groups we can
20:12
classify them we have human resources
20:15
we have capital resources and we have
20:18
natural resources
20:20
and over on the right side we have
20:22
examples of
20:23
each one so what are human resources
20:28
from the passage we saw that farmers
20:32
grow apples in the orchard so
20:35
farmers or gatherers in the orchard i'll
20:38
just put farmers here
20:40
farmers because that's easy
20:43
farmers are human resources well
20:47
their humans and their skills are
20:49
resources
20:50
farmers in the orchard are an example of
20:53
human resources
20:55
capital resources what's an example well
20:58
what helped
20:59
people produce apples remember sorting
21:01
the good apples from the bad apples
21:03
of course machines are used to do that
21:06
machines machines
21:10
machine oops sorry that's an s machines
21:13
that help
21:13
people produce apples so those are
21:16
capital resources so that is an example
21:19
of capital resources finally natural
21:22
resources we talked about this this is a
21:25
very
21:25
important type of natural resource that
21:28
is clean water
21:29
i'll just put water here water
21:33
water it should be clean of course you
21:35
don't want dirty water in your fields
21:38
water used during irrigation is a
21:41
natural
21:42
resource that has helped to keep the app
21:44
that helps
21:45
keep the apples healthy and delicious of
21:48
course too
21:49
there's not enough water maybe the
21:50
apples aren't delicious so you have to
21:52
have the right amount of
21:53
water okay so those are different types
21:56
of resources
21:57
that we can see in the reading section
21:59
and of course resources are very
22:01
important
22:02
for us they're very important for our
22:04
life and again i'll say it again because
22:06
it's very important
22:07
we must protect our natural resources
22:09
human resources
22:10
as long as there are human beings we
22:12
have many different human resources
22:14
we have to develop them of course
22:15
through education capital resources
22:18
we develop our capital resources through
22:20
increasing technology
22:22
now natural resources have always been
22:24
there we don't need to develop them
22:26
but we need to protect them so that
22:28
future generations
22:30
can use them and have and that they have
22:33
good access to these natural resources
22:35
okay
22:36
well that wraps up this lesson i hope it
22:38
was interesting hope you learned a lot
22:40
of interesting things and that
22:42
it helped with your english study thanks
22:45
for standing with me as always
22:46
and we'll see you in the next lesson
22:48
take care everybody bye bye
22:56
you
