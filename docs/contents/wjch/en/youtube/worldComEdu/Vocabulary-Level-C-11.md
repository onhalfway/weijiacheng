hello everybody
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
i'm brian stewart
well we're continuing on our theme of
robots
and have you ever wondered about where
robots
came from well in this lesson we're
going to find out
because we're going to talk about early
robots
we're going to learn about the history
of robots
where did robots come from what kind of
robots
were the first robots well let's take a
look at a picture first and we can see a
lot of different
examples of early robots you know the
first
robots that came out right it looks like
this machine this is all the robot yes
because it all controlled this little
robot bird up here on the top
right look at how ugly that is and all
that machinery
just for this tiny little robot at the
top right
and of course robots have been famous in
uh
storybooks and cartoon books uh
like this here uh there's been different
types of robots of course
early robots used in factories for
lifting things up
different different things i'm not
really sure what this is
now this is not a robot this is a person
it's a person an astronaut on the moon
but the
the people who went to the moon the
astronauts on the moon in the 1960s
used robots to help them get around on
the moon and also
to help them guide their spacecraft and
build the spacecraft to the moon
without robots people would not have
been able to go to the moon
here we can see some early robot legs
right
a little robot play dogs i think this is
called ibo right the little japanese
are robot dogs that were very popular
uh a few years ago and of course maybe
you have one of these in your home
this is an example of a robot vacuum
cleaner that goes around and cleans up
the um the dust and the dirt in your
home
okay so these are all examples of early
robots this is not so early
but it's still kind of a simple robot so
these
pictures all show different stages in
the history
of robots okay we have our first word
here
and it looks like she's having fun right
she's going around and around
she's to turn around on a center
and what is she on by the way she's on a
merry go
round she's on a merry-go-round that's
what we call this
play toy at a playground it's a
merry-go-round
and what is she doing the merry-go-round
just turns around on a center so what is
it doing it is
rotating to just turn around and around
and there's a center right
so you have the center and you're
turning around on the center you're just
rotating to rotate around the earth
rotates around on its center right
so um to rotate is just to turn around
and around
like on a merry-go-round actually when
you think about it
on the earth we're all on a very big
merry-go-round aren't we but we don't
feel it okay next one
uh the foot of an animal oh this is kind
of cute right do you have a dog
right sometimes you can say okay hello
hello and the dog will shake hands with
you
it's a trick right so when you do that
you take
the dog's what the foot of an animal we
we don't really call it a foot there's a
special word for it for animals not for
people
but for animals we call it a paw
a paw dogs have a paw
bears have a paw lions
have a paw but be careful of the lions
paw they're very dangerous right
but dog's paws are cute right you can
hold them and say hello doggie
right uh you can train your dog to shake
hands
or shake paws okay next one
oh who's this guy uh he looks maybe you
don't know who he is
okay it's getting a little bit old now
but
uh he is imitating a famous
speaker he is imitating
elvis presley if you don't know who that
is
ask your mom or dad they'll know he's a
famous
singer an amer famous american singer
elvis presley
uh he's a very deep voice like
you know he sings kind of like that okay
but elvis presley to imitate
what's another word for that to mimic
to mimic is to copy or
imitate somebody imitate also means to
copy
but a copy is like you know if you're
going to copy something you copy a book
on a machine
but if you're going to behave or
dress or act in the same way as somebody
else
it's better to use mimic instead of copy
right if you mimic somebody mimic is
specifically
for a person who is copying the
actions or behavior of another person
that is mimic so when you copy or behave
the actions of another person you are
imitating
them okay you are mimicking them
to mimic somebody okay next one
a wheel with teeth so these are wheels
right but they have teeth not teeth that
are going to bite
you right but teeth that catch
onto other teeth and turn them around
and these things
like you turn this one it will turn that
one and it will turn that one
and you can find these things in many
machines
this is how many machines are able to do
work with these gears with the gear
in fact in your car you have different
gears different speeds
on your bicycle you have different gears
right you can change the gear
on a fancy bicycle so if you're going up
a hill
or down a hill you can change the gear
to go faster
or to have more power when you pedal it
so gears are very important for many
different
machines they're just basically wheels
with
teeth on them okay to lift
something up to lift something up what
are they doing
they are raising so to raise uh
parts of a building to help them build
that building
they are raising something to lift
something up you raise
something what do you raise every day
in school you raise your hand i hope you
raise your hand
you should raise your hand in class ask
your teacher questions
if you don't know the answer raise your
hand
lift it up okay a bird with a heavy body
and
short legs you see these birds
everywhere especially in the city right
they're going
and they and they get the the bread or
they get the little things
from the uh ground and they go
right what are they they are pigeons
pigeons
but they're kind of dirty birds right
don't touch them you know maybe
you can throw them food but you know
don't chase them don't try to touch them
because that that's not good for your
health actually but these are called
pigeons and unfortunately they go hua
jiung chill everywhere right they go to
the bathroom
all over the place and it's little white
uh
places on the ground so they are pigeons
hopefully they don't fly over you
oh no that's terrible right but pigeons
are everywhere
okay what in the world is this guy doing
important and respected the word is
impressive now maybe that's
up to your opinion okay if i look at
this guy
i don't think impressive i think
silly or foolish okay but
let's say there's an important
politician or uh
important person gives a speech let's
say we're talking about like for example
martin luther king
do you know who that is martin luther
king was a very
important leader in america
uh history in the civil rights movement
he was a
black preacher who spoke for
equal rights for black people and white
people in fact people of
all races and all ages and all sexes
and he was a very impressive speaker he
was important
many people respected him he was
impressive
okay usually some politicians
are impressive unfortunately not all
politicians are impressive
actors can be impressive if you wow that
that person
really is a good actor then you respect
that person
they are impressive okay if you're an
artist
maybe you think that's impressive other
people might think it's kind of
silly but you know it's a matter of
opinion really
okay so impressive is important and
respected
next one of the present time
of the present time in this case they're
talking about the style
the style is a reflection
or it shows the present time it is
modern
style of course you know you can talk
about old-fashioned
style when you go into houses or
buildings you look at the
the decorations you can say oh this is
old-fashioned or some of them
they might look very modern very clean
very simple
modern style okay so modern it just
means of the present time
but modern doesn't just mean be careful
it doesn't just mean the decoration on
the inside of a building
it can also mean the way that people are
thinking oh that's modern thinking
or it's modern behavior or it's a modern
machinery or it's a modern movie so
modern just means
of the present time it's an adjective
used to describe
many different things next one
a type of tall plant with white or
colored
flowers and it looks like this do you
know what type of flower this is
this flower is called a lily
lily my wife her favorite flower is the
purple lily so i have to remember that
otherwise i get in trouble if i forget
right but anyway
lily is a very beautiful and impressive
flower so you could say wow a lily
can be an impressive flower because it's
very beautiful
okay a person who makes
and repairs oops that's a little mistake
there we'll just check that out
a person who makes and repairs clocks so
this person when they're making a clock
or they're repairing a clock
we call them a clock maker that's very
simple right
makes clocks clock maker
how simple is that we're just putting
two words
together to make one word clock
maker clock maker you could also say
watch maker people who make watches be
careful oh that's
a good thing this is not a clock do not
say that this is a clock this is not a
clock
that's konglish okay this is a watch
okay so watch
a clock is on the wall right if you have
a
clock on the wall that's a clock this is
a watch
don't say i have a clock on my wrist
what that's a big clock on your wrist
that's very heavy
it's very strange how do you put on your
shirt it's crazy right
so don't put a clock on your wrist put a
watch on your wrist but we can say
watch maker or clock maker
kind of the same thing they do the same
things really and they can probably do
both
right so you say he's a clock maker or
he's a watchmaker
okay so clockmaker or watchmaker but
remember the difference between clock
and watch they're not the same okay
whoa what happened here this guy looks
very
uh what is he looks very surprised
something that is not expected is
surprising
now be careful here do not say he is
surprising that's not right
he is sur
right be careful he is not surprising
don't use ing to describe him
use ed to describe him he is surprised
the
message the message is surprising
okay so we use surprising to describe
the thing that makes him surprised
okay and we do that with all sorts of
adjectives like that for example let's
take another one
a boring
do you say i am boring no
i say the book is boring it makes me
bored i am bored the book that i'm
reading
it's boring so if i read a book it's
boring
it makes me bored don't say
he is boring or i am boring because if
you do that what you're saying is that
i am boring i make other people bored
right don't say i am boring right uh
say i am bored okay he is surprised
not surprising he is surprised
because the message is surprising
okay so the thing that makes somebody
feel a certain way is ing the person's
reaction
is edie it's a good way to remember okay
the person's reaction is ed
the thing that causes that is ing
okay cause is ing reaction is
ed okay so boring board
surprising surprised confusing
confused please don't make a mistake now
notes that's a very common mistake
okay the next word here is unusual so
something may have pushed this boy down
but it's something unusual means it's
not
common not ordinary not
some maybe something that's not usual
that doesn't normally happen so another
word for unusual
is strange but it's interesting to note
that strange
may be a little bit of a negative uh
word
when we say unusual it doesn't mean
negative or positive it's just unusual
it's just
not ordinary but strange has a little
bit of a negative meaning so you say
if you say that's strange you may have a
little bit of a negative meaning to it
but strange just means unusual not
normal
if you say a strange force pushed the
boy down
it's not an ordinary force it's not a
usual thing
okay so let's move on where your ribs
and heart
are of course some of you guys might do
that do you play soccer
right you can bounce it off your what
off your chest
right that's fine you cannot bounce it
off your arms
but in soccer you can hit the ball or
football
you can hit the ball with your legs of
course with your chest
or with your head but no hands only the
goalie can use his hands but usually you
cannot use it so he's using his
chest to hit the ball it's where his
ribs
right and his heart boom boom boom are
located
where your ribs and your heart are
located that's your
chest okay
made of wood if we say something is made
of wood
we can just say one word to describe it
as an adjective
that adjective is wooden
wooden this is a wooden chair
maybe your desk at home is wooden it's
made
of wood okay next one
information sent from one person to
another
so what is information that is sent from
one person to another and think about
this
sometimes i call somebody they're not
there
but i talk to somebody maybe their
friend or their secretary or their
mother
what do i tell that person i give that
person
a message can i give him
a message give
whoops give someone
a message so means someone
give someone a message give someone a
message
that's a common expression also can i
take a message can i take
a message so let's review
what we should say i'm calling somebody
i'm calling my friend my friend's not
home his mother
is at home so i talked to his mother mrs
brown hi mrs brown
is james there i'm sorry james isn't
here
and mrs brown can say can i take a
message
so she's going to take a message from me
i say yes
i would like to give a message i'm going
to give james
a message please meet me after school
right so i can give james a message mrs
brown will take a message she'll write
it down
then she'll give the message to james
later so we can say give a message take
a message
very common expression message
information
sent from one person to another okay
next one
oh she looks like katie holmes doesn't
she
doesn't she look like tom cruises former
wife
yeah maybe that's from a movie okay
feeling happy she's feeling happy she's
got a lot of money in her hands right
so she can go buy something that she
wants
she is pleased pleased
she is pleased she's not pleasing
she's pleased that's her reaction
to the money so this is another example
right
it is pleasing to have a lot of money
the money is pleasing to her
she is pleased she is feeling happy
she is pleased remember ed is the
reaction
her reaction to the money she is pleased
not she is pleasing no the money
is pleasing she is pleased
okay now let's go over let's review the
vocabulary here
as usual in this case we must choose the
word that best completes the sentence
so we have a lot of sentences here we
need to choose the word from the box
that best fits in the blanks in these
sentences
let's review the words here very quickly
here first one is
rotates rotates
second one paw paw
next one mimic mimic
then raise raise
then we have pigeon pigeon
then modern modern
then impressive impressive
then gears gears
okay those are the words let's see how
they fit
into the sentences number one the doctor
removed the thorns
from the dog's what by the way what are
thorns
thorns are on a plant right sometimes
plants have like
sharp needles on them and if you brush
up against them
those thorns will go into your skin ouch
right and dogs you know dogs they're
running around they're having fun
they're smelling everything and so
they're messing around in the plants
and the thorns might get in their wuts
right dogs will walk on what what what
are dogs
feet and hands what word do we use for
those of course
we use paw the doctor removed the thorns
from the dog's paw
the dog was you know running around and
got thorns
in its paw so that's the word that we
use
two there are many beep in a clock
there are many what in a clock we talked
about this it's a wheel with
teeth and like i said these are very
important for many machines
they help those machines work and move
other things
i use the example of your bicycle on
your bicycle you have the chain that
goes around
one of these wheel with teeth and in
fancy bicycles you can change the
position
right to get more power or to get more
speed
what is that thing they are of course
gears and there are many
gears you have to use s because many
gears
in a clock and if you look inside the
clock there are many gears
that make the hands move and tell the
time
and remember this is a watch
not a clock okay actually i don't know
if there are any gears in here
some watches like this one are a little
bit modern right they're electronic
so it's all electronic there are no
gears but many clocks
have mechanical gears that work
and they move the hands on the clock
there are many gears
in a clock okay number three
the boy couldn't beep his arms because
he was sick
so in this case think about this if a
boy is sick
he can't do what with his arms his arms
are going to stay here
it's going to be hard for him to lift
what's another word for lift
what's another word for lift here
another word
is raise the boy couldn't raise his
arms because he was sick
okay next one number four in beep
society
people live longer so this is comparison
right because we're saying
longer longer than what
well if we think about it in society
nowadays
these days don't say in these days just
say these days
these days people live longer than
before
then traditional society what's the
opposite of
traditional it would be modern in
modern society remember i said we can
use
modern to describe many different things
not just the decorations
inside a building but also the way
people think
our lifestyles our society
in modern society people live longer
than they did before okay next one
number five
people can use a beep to send messages
through the air now we didn't talk about
this but i
i when i when i described this word i
said
you see them everywhere right and i said
they're kind of dirty don't touch them
right but i also said be careful because
they go to the bathroom all over the
place
but by the way they are also used a long
time ago
people would tie messages to their feet
and release them
and they would fly from one place to
another what kind of animal
does that of course we're talking about
pigeons
people can use a pigeon to send messages
through the air
and a long time ago people did use
pigeons you know before telephones
before the telegraph
the best way to send a message was with
a pigeon
right release the pigeon and the pigeons
were trained they knew
where their homes were so they would go
to their home you know take them away
from the home
release them they would go back to their
home and people would catch them oh
there's a message
and they would read the message six the
earth
beep around the sun now i talked about
this before when i was talking about a
merry-go-round and i said the earth
was doing this by itself but it's also
doing this
around the sun what is it doing it is of
course
it is rotating the earth
rotates around the sun so you could say
the earth also rotates because it moves
around
the center the center is the sun the
earth is moving around the center
so it's rotating around the sun but it
also rotates on its axis
okay seven the boy can beep his
uncle perfectly so here we're looking
for a word that's
that means copy right maybe his uncle
has a certain way
of talking hello kids how are you doing
today you know maybe
a funny way of talking and the boy can
copy that
perfectly sometimes people do that maybe
your friends can
copy famous actors or people on
television
and they copy them really well what are
they doing they're imitating those
people
they are mimicking those people so the
boy can mimic
his uncle perfectly he can copy his
behavior
very very well okay number eight
the president made and beep speech last
night
so the president made what kind of
speech
what kind of speech can the president
make something that's respected
something that maybe is important
something that gets a lot of attention
right there the president made an
impressive speech
last night so that would be that would
fit and of course
and because you have i there an
impressive
speech last night okay well that wraps
up the vocabulary section of the lesson
let's take a short break come back and
see how those words are used
in the reading passage don't go away

hello everybody
00:09
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
00:11
i'm brian stewart
00:13
well we're continuing on our theme of
00:15
robots
00:16
and have you ever wondered about where
00:19
robots
00:20
came from well in this lesson we're
00:22
going to find out
00:23
because we're going to talk about early
00:25
robots
00:26
we're going to learn about the history
00:29
of robots
00:30
where did robots come from what kind of
00:33
robots
00:34
were the first robots well let's take a
00:37
look at a picture first and we can see a
00:40
lot of different
00:41
examples of early robots you know the
00:44
first
00:44
robots that came out right it looks like
00:48
this machine this is all the robot yes
00:50
because it all controlled this little
00:52
robot bird up here on the top
00:54
right look at how ugly that is and all
00:57
that machinery
00:58
just for this tiny little robot at the
01:00
top right
01:01
and of course robots have been famous in
01:04
uh
01:05
storybooks and cartoon books uh
01:08
like this here uh there's been different
01:10
types of robots of course
01:12
early robots used in factories for
01:14
lifting things up
01:16
different different things i'm not
01:18
really sure what this is
01:20
now this is not a robot this is a person
01:23
it's a person an astronaut on the moon
01:26
but the
01:26
the people who went to the moon the
01:28
astronauts on the moon in the 1960s
01:32
used robots to help them get around on
01:35
the moon and also
01:36
to help them guide their spacecraft and
01:38
build the spacecraft to the moon
01:40
without robots people would not have
01:42
been able to go to the moon
01:45
here we can see some early robot legs
01:48
right
01:48
a little robot play dogs i think this is
01:51
called ibo right the little japanese
01:53
are robot dogs that were very popular
01:56
uh a few years ago and of course maybe
01:59
you have one of these in your home
02:01
this is an example of a robot vacuum
02:04
cleaner that goes around and cleans up
02:06
the um the dust and the dirt in your
02:09
home
02:10
okay so these are all examples of early
02:12
robots this is not so early
02:14
but it's still kind of a simple robot so
02:17
these
02:18
pictures all show different stages in
02:20
the history
02:21
of robots okay we have our first word
02:25
here
02:25
and it looks like she's having fun right
02:27
she's going around and around
02:29
she's to turn around on a center
02:33
and what is she on by the way she's on a
02:36
merry go
02:40
round she's on a merry-go-round that's
02:42
what we call this
02:45
play toy at a playground it's a
02:48
merry-go-round
02:49
and what is she doing the merry-go-round
02:52
just turns around on a center so what is
02:54
it doing it is
02:55
rotating to just turn around and around
02:58
and there's a center right
02:59
so you have the center and you're
03:00
turning around on the center you're just
03:03
rotating to rotate around the earth
03:06
rotates around on its center right
03:09
so um to rotate is just to turn around
03:12
and around
03:12
like on a merry-go-round actually when
03:15
you think about it
03:16
on the earth we're all on a very big
03:19
merry-go-round aren't we but we don't
03:21

it's better to use mimic instead of copy
05:07
right if you mimic somebody mimic is
05:09
specifically
05:11
for a person who is copying the
05:14
actions or behavior of another person
05:18
that is mimic so when you copy or behave
05:22
the actions of another person you are
05:24
imitating
05:25
them okay you are mimicking them
05:29
to mimic somebody okay next one
05:32
a wheel with teeth so these are wheels
05:35
right but they have teeth not teeth that
05:37
are going to bite
05:38
you right but teeth that catch
05:41
onto other teeth and turn them around
05:43
and these things
05:44
like you turn this one it will turn that
05:46
one and it will turn that one
05:48
and you can find these things in many
05:51
machines
05:52
this is how many machines are able to do
05:55
work with these gears with the gear
05:59
in fact in your car you have different
06:01
gears different speeds
06:03
on your bicycle you have different gears
06:06
right you can change the gear
06:08
on a fancy bicycle so if you're going up
06:10
a hill
06:11
or down a hill you can change the gear
06:14
to go faster
06:15
or to have more power when you pedal it
06:18
so gears are very important for many
06:21
different
06:21
machines they're just basically wheels
06:24
with
06:25
teeth on them okay to lift
06:28
something up to lift something up what
06:31
are they doing
06:32
they are raising so to raise uh
06:35
parts of a building to help them build
06:38
that building
06:39
they are raising something to lift
06:41
something up you raise
06:43
something what do you raise every day
06:46
in school you raise your hand i hope you
06:49

06:50
you should raise your hand in class ask
06:53
your teacher questions
06:54
if you don't know the answer raise your
06:57
hand
06:58
lift it up okay a bird with a heavy body
07:02
and
07:03
short legs you see these birds
07:05
everywhere especially in the city right
07:07
they're going
07:09
and they and they get the the bread or
07:11
they get the little things
07:13
from the uh ground and they go
07:16
right what are they they are pigeons
07:19
pigeons
07:20
but they're kind of dirty birds right
07:21
don't touch them you know maybe
07:23
you can throw them food but you know
07:25
don't chase them don't try to touch them
07:27
because that that's not good for your
07:29
health actually but these are called
07:31
pigeons and unfortunately they go hua
07:34
jiung chill everywhere right they go to
07:36
the bathroom
07:37
all over the place and it's little white
07:39
uh
07:40
places on the ground so they are pigeons
07:42
hopefully they don't fly over you
07:44
oh no that's terrible right but pigeons
07:46
are everywhere
07:47
okay what in the world is this guy doing
07:52
important and respected the word is
07:56
impressive now maybe that's
07:59
up to your opinion okay if i look at
08:03
this guy
08:04
i don't think impressive i think
08:07
silly or foolish okay but
08:10
let's say there's an important
08:12
politician or uh
08:14
important person gives a speech let's
08:16
say we're talking about like for example
08:17
martin luther king
08:19
do you know who that is martin luther
08:21
king was a very
08:22
important leader in america
08:26
uh history in the civil rights movement
08:29
he was a
08:30
black preacher who spoke for
08:33
equal rights for black people and white
08:35
people in fact people of
08:37
all races and all ages and all sexes
08:41
and he was a very impressive speaker he
08:44
was important
08:45
many people respected him he was
08:48
impressive
08:49
okay usually some politicians
08:52
are impressive unfortunately not all
08:54
politicians are impressive
08:56
actors can be impressive if you wow that
08:59
that person
08:59
really is a good actor then you respect
09:02
that person
09:03
they are impressive okay if you're an
09:06
artist
09:06
maybe you think that's impressive other
09:09
people might think it's kind of
09:10
silly but you know it's a matter of
09:12
opinion really
09:14
okay so impressive is important and
09:16
respected
09:17
next one of the present time
09:21
of the present time in this case they're
09:24
talking about the style
09:26
the style is a reflection
09:29
or it shows the present time it is
09:32
modern
09:32
style of course you know you can talk
09:35
about old-fashioned
09:36
style when you go into houses or
09:38
buildings you look at the
09:40
the decorations you can say oh this is
09:42
old-fashioned or some of them
09:44
they might look very modern very clean
09:46
very simple
09:48
modern style okay so modern it just
09:51
means of the present time
09:52
but modern doesn't just mean be careful
09:55
it doesn't just mean the decoration on
09:57
the inside of a building
09:58
it can also mean the way that people are
10:01
thinking oh that's modern thinking
10:03
or it's modern behavior or it's a modern
10:07
machinery or it's a modern movie so
10:10
modern just means
10:11
of the present time it's an adjective
10:14
used to describe
10:15
many different things next one
10:18
a type of tall plant with white or
10:21
colored
10:22
flowers and it looks like this do you
10:24
know what type of flower this is
10:26
this flower is called a lily
10:29
lily my wife her favorite flower is the
10:33
purple lily so i have to remember that
10:36
otherwise i get in trouble if i forget
10:37
right but anyway
10:39
lily is a very beautiful and impressive
10:42
flower so you could say wow a lily
10:46
can be an impressive flower because it's
10:48
very beautiful
10:49
okay a person who makes
10:52
and repairs oops that's a little mistake
10:54
there we'll just check that out
10:56
a person who makes and repairs clocks so
11:00
this person when they're making a clock
11:03
or they're repairing a clock
11:04
we call them a clock maker that's very
11:07
simple right
11:09
makes clocks clock maker
11:12
how simple is that we're just putting
11:14
two words
11:15
together to make one word clock
11:19
maker clock maker you could also say
11:22
watch maker people who make watches be
11:25
careful oh that's
11:26
a good thing this is not a clock do not
11:30
say that this is a clock this is not a
11:31
clock
11:32
that's konglish okay this is a watch
11:35
okay so watch
11:39
a clock is on the wall right if you have
11:42
a
11:42
clock on the wall that's a clock this is
11:45
a watch
11:46
don't say i have a clock on my wrist
11:48
what that's a big clock on your wrist
11:50
that's very heavy
11:51
it's very strange how do you put on your
11:53
shirt it's crazy right
11:55
so don't put a clock on your wrist put a
11:58
watch on your wrist but we can say
12:00
watch maker or clock maker
12:03
kind of the same thing they do the same
12:05
things really and they can probably do
12:06
both
12:07
right so you say he's a clock maker or
12:09
he's a watchmaker
12:10
okay so clockmaker or watchmaker but
12:13
remember the difference between clock
12:15
and watch they're not the same okay
12:18
whoa what happened here this guy looks
12:20
very
12:21
uh what is he looks very surprised
12:24
something that is not expected is
12:27
surprising
12:28
now be careful here do not say he is
12:31
surprising that's not right
12:33
he is sur
12:41
right be careful he is not surprising
12:44
don't use ing to describe him
12:47
use ed to describe him he is surprised
12:51
the
12:52
message the message is surprising
12:56
okay so we use surprising to describe
12:59
the thing that makes him surprised
13:04
okay and we do that with all sorts of
13:06
adjectives like that for example let's
13:08
take another one
13:09
a boring
13:13
do you say i am boring no
13:16
i say the book is boring it makes me
13:19
bored i am bored the book that i'm
13:22
reading
13:23
it's boring so if i read a book it's
13:26
boring
13:26
it makes me bored don't say
13:30
he is boring or i am boring because if
13:33
you do that what you're saying is that
13:35
i am boring i make other people bored
13:39
right don't say i am boring right uh
13:42
say i am bored okay he is surprised
13:45
not surprising he is surprised
13:48
because the message is surprising
13:52
okay so the thing that makes somebody
13:55
feel a certain way is ing the person's
13:58
reaction
13:59
is edie it's a good way to remember okay
14:02
the person's reaction is ed
14:05
the thing that causes that is ing
14:08
okay cause is ing reaction is
14:11
ed okay so boring board
14:15
surprising surprised confusing
14:18
confused please don't make a mistake now
14:21
notes that's a very common mistake
14:23
okay the next word here is unusual so
14:26
something may have pushed this boy down
14:28
but it's something unusual means it's
14:30
not
14:31
common not ordinary not
14:34
some maybe something that's not usual
14:37
that doesn't normally happen so another
14:40
word for unusual
14:41
is strange but it's interesting to note
14:44
that strange
14:45
may be a little bit of a negative uh
14:48
word
14:49
when we say unusual it doesn't mean
14:50
negative or positive it's just unusual
14:52
it's just
14:53
not ordinary but strange has a little
14:56
bit of a negative meaning so you say
14:59
if you say that's strange you may have a
15:02
little bit of a negative meaning to it
15:04
but strange just means unusual not
15:07
normal
15:08
if you say a strange force pushed the
15:11
boy down
15:12
it's not an ordinary force it's not a
15:14
usual thing
15:15
okay so let's move on where your ribs
15:18
and heart
15:19
are of course some of you guys might do
15:21
that do you play soccer
15:22
right you can bounce it off your what
15:25
off your chest
15:26
right that's fine you cannot bounce it
15:29
off your arms
15:30
but in soccer you can hit the ball or
15:32
football
15:33
you can hit the ball with your legs of
15:35
course with your chest
15:37
or with your head but no hands only the
15:40
goalie can use his hands but usually you
15:44
cannot use it so he's using his
15:46
chest to hit the ball it's where his
15:48
ribs
15:49
right and his heart boom boom boom are
15:52
located
15:53
where your ribs and your heart are
15:55
located that's your
15:56
chest okay
15:59
made of wood if we say something is made
16:02
of wood
16:03
we can just say one word to describe it
16:06
as an adjective
16:06
that adjective is wooden
16:10
wooden this is a wooden chair
16:13
maybe your desk at home is wooden it's
16:16
made
16:17
of wood okay next one
16:20
information sent from one person to
16:23
another
16:24
so what is information that is sent from
16:28
one person to another and think about
16:29
this
16:30
sometimes i call somebody they're not
16:32

16:33
but i talk to somebody maybe their
16:35

17:08
what we should say i'm calling somebody
17:11

17:49
information
17:50
sent from one person to another okay
17:53

17:54
oh she looks like katie holmes doesn't

18:10
wants
18:11
she is pleased pleased
18:15
she is pleased she's not pleasing
18:19
she's pleased that's her reaction
18:22
to the money so this is another example
18:24
right
18:25
it is pleasing to have a lot of money
18:28
the money is pleasing to her
18:31
she is pleased she is feeling happy
18:35
she is pleased remember ed is the
18:38
reaction
18:38
her reaction to the money she is pleased
18:42
not she is pleasing no the money
18:46
is pleasing she is pleased
18:49
okay now let's go over let's review the
18:52
vocabulary here
18:54
as usual in this case we must choose the
18:57
word that best completes the sentence
18:59
so we have a lot of sentences here we
19:01
need to choose the word from the box
19:04
that best fits in the blanks in these
19:07
sentences
19:08
let's review the words here very quickly
19:11
here first one is
19:12

19:15
second one paw paw
19:19
next one mimic mimic
19:23
then raise raise
19:27
then we have pigeon pigeon
19:31
then modern modern
19:35
then impressive impressive
19:39
then gears gears
19:43
okay those are the words let's see how
19:45
they fit
19:46
into the sentences number one the doctor
19:49
removed the thorns
19:51
from the dog's what by the way what are
19:54
thorns
19:55
thorns are on a plant right sometimes
19:58
plants have like
19:59
sharp needles on them and if you brush
20:01
up against them
20:02
those thorns will go into your skin ouch
20:06
right and dogs you know dogs they're
20:08
running around they're having fun
20:10
they're smelling everything and so
20:12
they're messing around in the plants
20:15
and the thorns might get in their wuts
20:18
right dogs will walk on what what what
20:21
are dogs
20:23
feet and hands what word do we use for
20:25
those of course
20:26
we use paw the doctor removed the thorns
20:30
from the dog's paw
20:31
the dog was you know running around and
20:33
got thorns
20:34
in its paw so that's the word that we
20:37
use
20:38
two there are many beep in a clock
20:42
there are many what in a clock we talked
20:44
about this it's a wheel with
20:45
teeth and like i said these are very
20:48
important for many machines
20:50
they help those machines work and move
20:53
other things
20:53
i use the example of your bicycle on
20:56
your bicycle you have the chain that
20:58
goes around
20:59
one of these wheel with teeth and in
21:01
fancy bicycles you can change the
21:03
position
21:04
right to get more power or to get more
21:06
speed
21:07
what is that thing they are of course
21:09
gears and there are many
21:11
gears you have to use s because many
21:13
gears
21:14
in a clock and if you look inside the
21:16
clock there are many gears
21:18
that make the hands move and tell the
21:20
time
21:21
and remember this is a watch
21:24
not a clock okay actually i don't know
21:26
if there are any gears in here
21:27
some watches like this one are a little
21:30
bit modern right they're electronic
21:32
so it's all electronic there are no
21:34
gears but many clocks
21:36
have mechanical gears that work
21:40
and they move the hands on the clock
21:42
there are many gears
21:43
in a clock okay number three
21:46
the boy couldn't beep his arms because
21:49
he was sick
21:51
so in this case think about this if a
21:53
boy is sick
21:54
he can't do what with his arms his arms
21:56
are going to stay here
21:58
it's going to be hard for him to lift
22:00
what's another word for lift
22:02
what's another word for lift here
22:05
another word
22:05
is raise the boy couldn't raise his
22:09
arms because he was sick
22:12
okay next one number four in beep
22:15
society
22:16
people live longer so this is comparison
22:20
right because we're saying
22:21
longer longer than what
22:24
well if we think about it in society
22:27
nowadays
22:29
these days don't say in these days just
22:31
say these days
22:32
these days people live longer than
22:35
before
22:36
then traditional society what's the
22:39
opposite of
22:40
traditional it would be modern in
22:43
modern society remember i said we can
22:46
use
22:46
modern to describe many different things
22:49
not just the decorations
22:50
inside a building but also the way
22:53
people think
22:54
our lifestyles our society
22:57
in modern society people live longer
23:00
than they did before okay next one
23:04
number five
23:06
people can use a beep to send messages
23:10
through the air now we didn't talk about
23:12
this but i
23:13
i when i when i described this word i
23:15
said
23:16
you see them everywhere right and i said
23:18
they're kind of dirty don't touch them
23:20
right but i also said be careful because
23:22
they go to the bathroom all over the
23:23
place
23:23
but by the way they are also used a long
23:26
time ago
23:27
people would tie messages to their feet
23:30
and release them
23:31
and they would fly from one place to
23:33
another what kind of animal
23:35
does that of course we're talking about
23:38
pigeons
23:39
people can use a pigeon to send messages
23:41
through the air
23:42
and a long time ago people did use
23:46
pigeons you know before telephones
23:49
before the telegraph
23:51
the best way to send a message was with
23:53
a pigeon
23:54
right release the pigeon and the pigeons
23:56
were trained they knew
23:57
where their homes were so they would go
23:59
to their home you know take them away
24:01
from the home
24:01
release them they would go back to their
24:03
home and people would catch them oh
24:05
