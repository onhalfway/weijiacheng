hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading my name is brian stewart
and in this lesson we're looking at
science book 4
lesson 11 exploring
electricity how much do you know about
electricity in this lesson you will
discover
how electricity is made and different
types
of electricity okay let's begin with the
vocabulary
the first word is charge
charge in this meaning means to put
electrical
energy in a battery look at these
batteries here
each battery has some electrical
power in it when you use it all up
the power is gone so you put it in a
charger this is called a charger
to charge the batteries to put power
back into the battery
next we have plug plug
here is a verb but it can also be a noun
i will explain in a few seconds
but plug as a verb means to connect an
electrical device
to an electricity supply how do
you do that well you see this green part
here
this green part if we take it out and
look at it sideways
it probably looks like this right
i'm not a very good artist i'm sorry and
this is the wire
so this is also a plug but this is a
noun
so to plug means to plug
the plug into this thing here
which we'll see later we usually call it
an outlet
but also many people also call that a
plug
so you put a plug into a plug
sometimes sometimes people will also
call it a plug there's another word for
that
that we will learn shortly so
plug can have many meanings it means to
put an electrical device into
a plug in the wall so that your vacuum
cleaner
or your electrical device whatever it is
your computer gets power
okay switch
you can see switches on the walls
in the room those are for the lights
right
a switch now again this here is
a verb but it can also be a noun
this is a switch but switch is also a
verb it means
to turn an electrical device on
or off right the electric device
your computer is on or off
where is the switch on your computer
maybe it's a button
you push it you switch it on
switch it on but it's also the device is
also called a switch so it's a verb and
a noun okay
outlet remember before i
mentioned this is also called a plug
some people also call it a plug
so a plug is on the end of a wire and
it's also in the wall you plug a plug
into a plug for example but we also call
it
an outlet outlet because it lets
out electricity right it lets
electricity out
the place in your home where electricity
comes
out you let the electricity out
it's an outlet okay good
next we have turbine turbine is a
machine
wow look at this machine it's really big
and it looks very complicated
something like from a science fiction
movie right
okay but a turbine is just a machine it
uses water
it can use gas it can use coal
it turns a wheel and as we'll see in the
reading when you turn that wheel you can
generate electricity you can make
electricity
so a turbine is very important for
making
electricity okay
a power plant now a power plant there
are many kinds
of power plants a power plant is a
building
where electricity is made we also call
it
a power station now if you notice this
type of power plant
you see this very unique
looking tower that is a
symbol of a nuclear power plant
they're using excuse me they're using
nuclear
energy to produce electricity
other power plants that don't use
electricity
that don't use nuclear power don't have
those
for example a dam a dam
uses water to turn the turbine to make
electricity
and that could be a power plant also
okay
generator a generator is a machine that
makes
electricity it's another type of machine
that makes electricity
and sometimes people will use a gas
generator they'll put gas like gas you
put in your car
they'll put it into a generator to make
electricity
this is useful in case there's an
accident or a disaster and the power
plant
doesn't work or the electricity is cut
to a certain area some people might have
generators at their home they put gas in
it and it will produce electricity for
their house
so that's a generator okay interesting
words right
let's check out the rest of the lesson
okay one of the main ideas for this
lesson is how to make
electricity at a power plant right
that's interesting
because you think about it we don't
usually think about it we just
hit the switch hit the switch to turn on
the electricity we don't even think
about it where does that power
come from have you ever wondered that
that's an interesting question
well it comes from a power plant right
and how
is it made well there are three steps
first step we have energy coming from
burning coal or oil flowing water
or wind turns a turbine so we can see
many different
sources of energy you can burn coal
or oil you can have flowing water
remember the example i gave of the dam
when you have a dam it blocks the flow
like a river
and you can let the water out and the
water
is turns a turbine and that generates
electricity
a very famous dam we call that a
hydroelectric dam hydro
hydro means water hydroelectric
dam and a dam of course is when you
block
the flow of water like a river you make
a lake
but you let the you let some water go
through you capture that energy
and you make electricity from it so
flowing water
or wind sometimes when you go to the
countryside you can see this really big
wind mills right they're usually white
and they they rotate when the wind is
blowing
very quickly and that turning motion
turns a turbine
it generates electricity so many
different
energy sources so we have our source of
energy
what does it do the turbine spins it
makes
a turbine spin and the turbine spins a
big
magnet inside a generator
the generator makes electricity aha
so the turbine is inside the generator
so that's how electricity is made but
how does it get to your house
well electricity leaves the power plant
leaves the power plant
it travels through these wires you see
these wires
behind these big towers and we call
those power lines
right power lines and of course again if
you're driving in the countryside
sometimes you see these big metal towers
or sometimes they're smaller than just a
wooden pole
and they have one line or maybe two
lines
connecting all the poles those are
electrical wires
by the way those are very dangerous
there's ever an accident
and one of those poles falls over and
the wire is on the ground
stay away and call somebody for help
because those can be very dangerous okay
good
okay so that's how electricity is made
and how
it is delivered to your house
now what are different types of
electricity
well we have current electricity right
that flows
into an outlet or a plug into your house
by the way be careful do not play
with those outlets if you see the outlet
on the side of the wall
in your room or in your living room in
your house don't play with those
because they could be very dangerous be
careful okay
so anyway current electricity it is an
energy it's a very strong energy and it
can give you a shock
it moves in a circuit a circuit
it can be changed into heat light or
sound energy heat is what you have to be
careful of
when of course you don't play with
electricity
because it can cause very severe
very very big burns on your skin and
inside your body it comes from
batteries or outlets in the wall don't
worry about batteries right batteries
are usually
safe they don't have a lot of power it's
the outlets be
careful around outlets also be careful
about batteries too
but don't worry you can hold batteries
don't be afraid of batteries
okay good so that's current electricity
and that's very useful electricity
we use that in our house for our lights
for our computers
for all the electronic toys our phones
things like that okay but there's
another type of electricity
it's called static electricity have you
ever noticed it
if the day is very dry and maybe
you're walking with big socks on a
carpet
and you touch the switch sometimes you
get a little whoa what was that
that is static electricity it is
energy made by tiny pieces of
matter tiny little pieces of matter when
these pieces of matter
attract or repel each other
they have a charge and sometimes
you can see that static electricity can
make your hair
stand up by the way if you like this
hairstyle
i can tell you how to get it take a
balloon
blow it up tie it off right and you've
got your balloon
then rub your hair with it and then take
it off and your hair will stick up
crazy you'll look like einstein okay
so anyway that's that's what's happening
there is static electricity
is making your hair stand up and it
attracts it to the balloon
very interesting huh okay anyway those
are two different types of electricity
let's go over the reading together as
usual
i will read it out loud practice along
with me out loud or
in your head right focus on the
vocabulary
and try to match my pronunciation
are you ready let's begin
electricity is energy
it is used in electrical
devices most electricity
is made inside a building
called a power plant
a generator makes electricity
inside the generator there is a
big fan called a turbine
the turbine spins a big
magnet and electricity is
created then
this electricity leaves the power plant
and travels down wires to homes
and buildings we can now
use this electricity
electrical devices need
electricity to work we
plug a device into an
outlet electricity moves
into the device and then it can be
used
a television is an electrical device
you need to plug it in and
switch it on before you can
watch it electricity
can be stored in a battery
a device with a battery in it
is plugged into an outlet
the battery gets charged
charged okay a little bit difficult yeah
but i just want to point out two things
here
plug it in switch it
on so these are good uh useful
expressions to remember when we talk
about electrical devices
plug it in to an outlet switch it on
turn it on means the same thing then you
can use
your electrical device okay
let's talk about how the information in
this reading passage
is organized here we have main idea
and supporting details again the main
idea
is a general idea it's a very broad
idea and then the details are specific
examples
that support that idea so what is the
main idea
the main idea is electricity is
used in electrical devices
your television your computer your cell
phone
all use electricity these are
all electrical devices devices like a
machine
or it's a tool that you use for your
enjoyment
or to help you do some work
so that's a very broad idea electricity
is used in electrical devices
let's support that with some more
details first of all we have
a generator makes electricity a beep
spins a magnet and electricity is made
so we talked about this what spins the
magnet
to make electricity remember that big
machine i talked about
looks like it's from a science fiction
movie of course we are talking about
a turbine
so a turbine a not a n
a turbine or a turbine spins a magnet
and electricity
is made electricity travels
moves through the wires to homes and
buildings
so in our home we beep a device
into a beep and switch it on okay so
remember i highlighted those two verbs
right switch it on but what was the
other one
we plug we plug
now here you plug it in but notice into
is here
so you plug it
it means a device into and you can say
in or into it doesn't matter
so plug a device in or plug
a device into plug it in
it represents a device here so
we plug a device into a what
what do we call that from the vocabulary
we call that
an outlet oops
and of course you could also call it a
plug as i said before during the
vocabulary
you plug a device into a plug you could
say that also
but in the vocabulary here we talked
about outlet
most people will call it an outlet right
some people
informally call it a plug okay so you
plug a device
into an outlet and you switch it on you
turn it on so the device
gets the electricity to operate okay
so a device with a battery in it is
plugged
into an outlet so let's say you have a
device with a battery in it
hmm what device has a battery in it that
we use all the time
of course a cell phone a cell phone has
a battery in it
but as you know the battery charge gets
lower and lower
and lower and then your battery your
cell phone doesn't work
by the way when the battery has
no power we say the battery is
dead my cell phone is dead oh my gosh
but don't worry
you can bring it back to life again just
plug it in
then your battery gets what what happens
to your battery
it gets charged
right so we can use batteries over
and over and over again the charge goes
down to
zero and then you charge the battery
back up and then you use that charge
and then you charge it back up and
that's of course what we normally do
with our cell phones
almost every day or every two days at
least okay
so anyway that was our lesson on
exploring electricity so now the next
time you flip a switch
and the light comes on in your room you
have a better
idea about hey where does that power
come from
how does this how does this work right i
just flip a switch and i get light
what's going on well of course it's
electricity
and we talked about how it is made what
are the sources of electricity
where it is made and how it travels to
your home
and of course be careful around
electricity right
don't play around outlets in the wall of
your home
but you can play with static electricity
that's kind of fun
it makes your hair stand up okay so
anyway i hope you enjoyed this lesson
and learned some useful words we'll see
you in the next video lesson
take care everybody bye bye

hello everybody
00:09
welcome back to american textbook
00:11
reading my name is brian stewart
00:13
and in this lesson we're looking at
00:15
science book 4
00:17
lesson 11 exploring
00:20
electricity how much do you know about
00:24
electricity in this lesson you will
00:27
discover
00:28
how electricity is made and different
00:31
types
00:32
of electricity okay let's begin with the
00:36
vocabulary
00:37
the first word is charge
00:40
charge in this meaning means to put
00:43
electrical
00:44
energy in a battery look at these
00:47
batteries here
00:49
each battery has some electrical
00:52
power in it when you use it all up
00:55
the power is gone so you put it in a
00:59
charger this is called a charger
01:04
to charge the batteries to put power
01:08
back into the battery
01:12
next we have plug plug
01:16
here is a verb but it can also be a noun
01:19
i will explain in a few seconds
01:22
but plug as a verb means to connect an
01:25
electrical device
01:27
to an electricity supply how do
01:31
you do that well you see this green part
01:33
here
01:34
this green part if we take it out and
01:36
look at it sideways
01:38
it probably looks like this right
01:43
i'm not a very good artist i'm sorry and
01:45
this is the wire
01:47
so this is also a plug but this is a
01:51
noun
01:52
so to plug means to plug
01:55
the plug into this thing here
02:00
which we'll see later we usually call it
02:02
an outlet
02:03
but also many people also call that a
02:06
plug
02:07
so you put a plug into a plug
02:10
sometimes sometimes people will also
02:12
call it a plug there's another word for
02:14
that
02:15
that we will learn shortly so
02:18
plug can have many meanings it means to
02:22
put an electrical device into
02:26
a plug in the wall so that your vacuum
02:29
cleaner
02:29
or your electrical device whatever it is
02:33
your computer gets power
02:36
okay switch
02:40
you can see switches on the walls
02:43
in the room those are for the lights
02:46
right
02:46
a switch now again this here is
02:50
a verb but it can also be a noun
02:54
this is a switch but switch is also a
02:57
verb it means
02:58
to turn an electrical device on
03:02
or off right the electric device
03:05
your computer is on or off
03:09
where is the switch on your computer
03:12
maybe it's a button
03:13
you push it you switch it on
03:16
switch it on but it's also the device is
03:19
also called a switch so it's a verb and
03:22
a noun okay
03:26
outlet remember before i
03:30
mentioned this is also called a plug
03:34
some people also call it a plug
03:37
so a plug is on the end of a wire and
03:40
it's also in the wall you plug a plug
03:42
into a plug for example but we also call
03:45
it
03:46
an outlet outlet because it lets
03:49
out electricity right it lets
03:52
electricity out
03:53
the place in your home where electricity
03:56
comes
03:57
out you let the electricity out
04:00
it's an outlet okay good
04:05
next we have turbine turbine is a
04:08
machine
04:09
wow look at this machine it's really big
04:11
and it looks very complicated
04:13
something like from a science fiction
04:15
movie right
04:16
okay but a turbine is just a machine it
04:19
uses water
04:20
it can use gas it can use coal
04:24
it turns a wheel and as we'll see in the
04:27
reading when you turn that wheel you can
04:29
generate electricity you can make
04:32
electricity
04:33
so a turbine is very important for
04:36
making
04:37
electricity okay
04:41
a power plant now a power plant there
04:44
are many kinds
04:45
of power plants a power plant is a
04:49
building
04:49
where electricity is made we also call
04:53
it
04:53
a power station now if you notice this
04:56
type of power plant
04:58
you see this very unique
05:01
looking tower that is a
05:05
symbol of a nuclear power plant
05:08
they're using excuse me they're using
05:10
nuclear
05:12
energy to produce electricity
05:15
other power plants that don't use
05:18
electricity
05:19
that don't use nuclear power don't have
05:22
those
05:22
for example a dam a dam
05:26
uses water to turn the turbine to make
05:28
electricity
05:30
and that could be a power plant also
05:32
okay
05:35
generator a generator is a machine that
05:38
makes
05:39
electricity it's another type of machine
05:42
that makes electricity
05:45
and sometimes people will use a gas
05:48
generator they'll put gas like gas you
05:50
put in your car
05:51
they'll put it into a generator to make
05:53
electricity
05:54
this is useful in case there's an
05:58
accident or a disaster and the power
06:01
plant
06:02
doesn't work or the electricity is cut
06:04
to a certain area some people might have
06:07
generators at their home they put gas in
06:09
it and it will produce electricity for
06:12
their house
06:13
so that's a generator okay interesting
06:16
words right
06:17
let's check out the rest of the lesson
06:20
okay one of the main ideas for this
06:22
lesson is how to make
06:24
electricity at a power plant right
06:27
that's interesting
06:28
because you think about it we don't
06:30
usually think about it we just
06:33
hit the switch hit the switch to turn on
06:36
the electricity we don't even think
06:38
about it where does that power
06:40
come from have you ever wondered that
06:42
that's an interesting question
06:44
well it comes from a power plant right
06:46
and how
06:47
is it made well there are three steps
06:51
first step we have energy coming from
06:55
burning coal or oil flowing water
06:59
or wind turns a turbine so we can see
07:03
many different
07:03
sources of energy you can burn coal
07:07
or oil you can have flowing water
07:10
remember the example i gave of the dam
07:14
when you have a dam it blocks the flow
07:16
like a river
07:18
and you can let the water out and the
07:21
water
07:21
is turns a turbine and that generates
07:24
electricity
07:25
a very famous dam we call that a
07:28
hydroelectric dam hydro
07:31
hydro means water hydroelectric
07:38
dam and a dam of course is when you
07:41
block
07:42
the flow of water like a river you make
07:44
a lake
07:45
but you let the you let some water go
07:47
through you capture that energy
07:49
and you make electricity from it so
07:52
flowing water
07:53
or wind sometimes when you go to the
07:55
countryside you can see this really big
07:58
wind mills right they're usually white
08:01
and they they rotate when the wind is
08:04
blowing
08:05
very quickly and that turning motion
08:07
turns a turbine
08:08
it generates electricity so many
08:11
different
08:12
energy sources so we have our source of
08:15
energy
08:15
what does it do the turbine spins it
08:19
makes
08:19
a turbine spin and the turbine spins a
08:22
big
08:23
magnet inside a generator
08:26
the generator makes electricity aha
08:30
so the turbine is inside the generator
08:33
so that's how electricity is made but
08:36
how does it get to your house
08:38
well electricity leaves the power plant
08:42
leaves the power plant
08:43
it travels through these wires you see
08:45
these wires
08:46
behind these big towers and we call
08:49
those power lines
08:51
right power lines and of course again if
08:53
you're driving in the countryside
08:55
sometimes you see these big metal towers
08:58
or sometimes they're smaller than just a
08:59
wooden pole
09:00
and they have one line or maybe two
09:02
lines
09:03
connecting all the poles those are
09:05
electrical wires
09:06
by the way those are very dangerous
09:09
there's ever an accident
09:10
and one of those poles falls over and
09:12
the wire is on the ground
09:13
stay away and call somebody for help
09:16
because those can be very dangerous okay
09:19
good
09:21
okay so that's how electricity is made
09:23
and how
09:24
it is delivered to your house
09:29
now what are different types of
09:31
electricity
09:32
well we have current electricity right
09:35
that flows
09:36
into an outlet or a plug into your house
09:39
by the way be careful do not play
09:42
with those outlets if you see the outlet
09:45
on the side of the wall
09:47
in your room or in your living room in
09:48
your house don't play with those
09:50
because they could be very dangerous be
09:53
careful okay
09:54
so anyway current electricity it is an
09:57
energy it's a very strong energy and it
10:00
can give you a shock
10:02
it moves in a circuit a circuit
10:05
it can be changed into heat light or
10:08
sound energy heat is what you have to be
10:11
careful of
10:12
when of course you don't play with
10:14
electricity
10:15
because it can cause very severe
10:18
very very big burns on your skin and
10:22
inside your body it comes from
10:25
batteries or outlets in the wall don't
10:28
worry about batteries right batteries
10:30
are usually
10:31
safe they don't have a lot of power it's
10:33
the outlets be
10:34
careful around outlets also be careful
10:37
about batteries too
10:39
but don't worry you can hold batteries
10:41
don't be afraid of batteries
10:43
okay good so that's current electricity
10:45
and that's very useful electricity
10:48
we use that in our house for our lights
10:50
for our computers
10:51
for all the electronic toys our phones
10:54
things like that okay but there's
10:56
another type of electricity
10:58
it's called static electricity have you
11:01
ever noticed it
11:03
if the day is very dry and maybe
11:06
you're walking with big socks on a
11:08
carpet
11:09
and you touch the switch sometimes you
11:11
get a little whoa what was that
11:14
that is static electricity it is
11:17
energy made by tiny pieces of
11:20
matter tiny little pieces of matter when
11:23
these pieces of matter
11:25
attract or repel each other
11:29
they have a charge and sometimes
11:32
you can see that static electricity can
11:34
make your hair
11:35
stand up by the way if you like this
11:38
hairstyle
11:39
i can tell you how to get it take a
11:42
balloon
11:43
blow it up tie it off right and you've
11:46
got your balloon
11:46
then rub your hair with it and then take
11:49
it off and your hair will stick up
11:52
crazy you'll look like einstein okay
11:55
so anyway that's that's what's happening
11:57
there is static electricity
11:59
is making your hair stand up and it
12:01
attracts it to the balloon
12:03
very interesting huh okay anyway those
12:06
are two different types of electricity
12:09
let's go over the reading together as
12:12
usual
12:12
i will read it out loud practice along
12:16
with me out loud or
12:17
in your head right focus on the
12:20
vocabulary
12:21
and try to match my pronunciation
12:24
are you ready let's begin
12:28
electricity is energy
12:31
it is used in electrical
12:35
devices most electricity
12:39
is made inside a building
12:43
called a power plant
12:49
a generator makes electricity
12:53
inside the generator there is a
12:56
big fan called a turbine
13:00
the turbine spins a big
13:03
magnet and electricity is
13:07
created then
13:10
this electricity leaves the power plant
13:15
and travels down wires to homes
13:19
and buildings we can now
13:22
use this electricity
13:27
electrical devices need
13:30
electricity to work we
13:34
plug a device into an
13:37
outlet electricity moves
13:41
into the device and then it can be
13:46
used
13:48
a television is an electrical device
13:52
you need to plug it in and
13:56
switch it on before you can
13:59
watch it electricity
14:03
can be stored in a battery
14:06
a device with a battery in it
14:09
is plugged into an outlet
14:14
the battery gets charged
14:17
charged okay a little bit difficult yeah
14:20
but i just want to point out two things
14:22
here
14:23
plug it in switch it
14:26
on so these are good uh useful
14:29
expressions to remember when we talk
14:32
about electrical devices
14:34
plug it in to an outlet switch it on
14:38
turn it on means the same thing then you
14:41
can use
14:42
your electrical device okay
14:47
let's talk about how the information in
14:50
this reading passage
14:51
is organized here we have main idea
14:54
and supporting details again the main
14:57
idea
14:58
is a general idea it's a very broad
15:02
idea and then the details are specific
15:04
examples
15:05
that support that idea so what is the
15:09
main idea
15:10
the main idea is electricity is
15:13
used in electrical devices
15:16
your television your computer your cell
15:19
phone
15:20
all use electricity these are
15:24
all electrical devices devices like a
15:28
machine
15:28
or it's a tool that you use for your
15:31
enjoyment
15:32
or to help you do some work
15:36
so that's a very broad idea electricity
15:38
is used in electrical devices
15:41
let's support that with some more
15:43
details first of all we have
15:45
a generator makes electricity a beep
15:48
spins a magnet and electricity is made
15:52
so we talked about this what spins the
15:54
magnet
15:55
to make electricity remember that big
15:57
machine i talked about
15:59
looks like it's from a science fiction
16:01
movie of course we are talking about
16:03
a turbine
16:06
so a turbine a not a n
16:10
a turbine or a turbine spins a magnet
16:13
and electricity
16:15
is made electricity travels
16:19
moves through the wires to homes and
16:22
buildings
16:23
so in our home we beep a device
16:26
into a beep and switch it on okay so
16:29
remember i highlighted those two verbs
16:31
right switch it on but what was the
16:33
other one
16:34
we plug we plug
16:37
now here you plug it in but notice into
16:40
is here
16:41
so you plug it
16:44
it means a device into and you can say
16:47
in or into it doesn't matter
16:49
so plug a device in or plug
16:52
a device into plug it in
16:55
it represents a device here so
16:59
we plug a device into a what
17:02
what do we call that from the vocabulary
17:05
we call that
17:06
an outlet oops
17:09
and of course you could also call it a
17:11
plug as i said before during the
17:13
vocabulary
17:14
you plug a device into a plug you could
17:16
say that also
17:17
but in the vocabulary here we talked
17:19
about outlet
17:20
most people will call it an outlet right
17:23
some people
17:24
informally call it a plug okay so you
17:27
plug a device
17:28
into an outlet and you switch it on you
17:31
turn it on so the device
17:32
gets the electricity to operate okay
17:36
so a device with a battery in it is
17:39
plugged
17:40
into an outlet so let's say you have a
17:42
device with a battery in it
17:44
hmm what device has a battery in it that
17:46
we use all the time
17:48
of course a cell phone a cell phone has
17:50
a battery in it
17:51
but as you know the battery charge gets
17:54
lower and lower
17:55
and lower and then your battery your
17:57
cell phone doesn't work
17:59
by the way when the battery has
18:02
no power we say the battery is
18:05
dead my cell phone is dead oh my gosh
18:09
but don't worry
18:09
you can bring it back to life again just
18:12
plug it in
18:13
then your battery gets what what happens
18:16
to your battery
18:17
it gets charged
18:21
right so we can use batteries over
18:24
and over and over again the charge goes
18:27
down to
18:28
zero and then you charge the battery
18:30
back up and then you use that charge
18:32
and then you charge it back up and
18:34
that's of course what we normally do
18:36
with our cell phones
18:37
almost every day or every two days at
18:39
least okay
18:41
so anyway that was our lesson on
18:44
exploring electricity so now the next
18:47
time you flip a switch
18:48
and the light comes on in your room you
18:51
have a better
18:52
idea about hey where does that power
18:54
come from
18:55
how does this how does this work right i
18:57
just flip a switch and i get light
19:00
what's going on well of course it's
19:02
electricity
19:03
and we talked about how it is made what
19:05
are the sources of electricity
19:08
where it is made and how it travels to
19:10
your home
19:12
and of course be careful around
19:13
electricity right
19:15
don't play around outlets in the wall of
19:18
your home
19:18
but you can play with static electricity
19:21
that's kind of fun
19:22
it makes your hair stand up okay so
19:25
anyway i hope you enjoyed this lesson
19:27
and learned some useful words we'll see
19:29
you in the next video lesson
19:31
take care everybody bye bye
19:41
