hello everybody and welcome back to
american textbook reading i'm brian
stewart and in this lesson we're taking
a look at
social studies book 4 lesson 10
work and income in this unit
you will discover what people do to make
money
and what free enterprise is
so let's get started
our first word is occupation
occupation occupation is just
a job that a person has so occupation
is a fancy word for job
okay next we have skill
skill is the ability that is needed to
do something
i'm sure that you have a certain skill
maybe you're
good at playing a piano skill means you
are
good at doing something the ability that
is needed to do something yes but also
that you
are good at something if you are good at
playing a piano
you have the skill to play piano maybe
of musical skills
if you play sports really well you have
athletic skills okay if you study very
well
you have good memory skills or maybe
good reading skills
okay so skill is the ability needed to
do
something next we have
training training is when you
learn skills or knowledge that you
need to do to perform a job
to do a job to work at a job
now training can be a lot of different
types of training
you can train from a book but many
people consider
training as actually doing the things or
that
are learning the skills that you need to
do a job
and sometimes people say on the job
training
on the job
training on the job training means
learning how to do a job
while you're working right so when you
start a new job
maybe an older person or a more
experienced person
will show you how to do that job that's
called
on-the-job training
free enterprise free enterprise is the
idea
the concept that is very important to a
capitalistic
open democratic society that means that
you
have the freedom to run a business
to earn money it's your choice you have
the freedom
if you want to make a company that makes
pillows and you want to sell pillows to
people
you have the freedom to do that if you
want to sell
drinks lemonade gator not gatorade
don't do that somebody's already doing
it lemonade
orange aid or you know uh
jamong jammon grapefruit grapefruit aid
you can do that you know whatever idea
you have you have the freedom
to start your own business that is free
enterprise
income income is the money that you earn
from doing a job why get a job
because you need to earn money to pay
for your housing your food your clothes
your transportation
we need money in order to live in our
society
so you want to get a job hopefully a job
that you like
doing that you are skilled at and from
that job
you receive money that money is called
income
and income is usually regular amounts of
money
every month or every two weeks that you
receive from doing a job
and many people will talk about their
yearly
income or their monthly income
next we have service job in
our society there are many different
types of jobs there's manufacturing
jobs where people make things
but there are also service jobs where
people they don't make things but they
provide services they do
things for other people for example this
man here
he is delivering packages right we don't
have time
to go to another country or another
state or somewhere far away
and get the thing that we want no we buy
it maybe through the internet
and then somebody will deliver it to us
that's a service
that they provide for us so that is a
service job
service job is a job that provides
people with a
service such as a mail carrier
for example this man here or a delivery
person a bus driver
bus drivers they provide a service they
transport you
from your home to your school or a hair
stylist
do you cut your hair by yourself do you
want your mom to cut your hair
better to go to a a hair stylist who
will cut your hair
in a nice fashionable way that's a
hairstyles and these are all different
types
of service jobs okay that's our
vocabulary
for this lesson
now the first main idea of this lesson
is
selling goods and selling services
now like i said before some people their
job they
make things or they produce things other
people might just
do useful services for other people so
we have a couple different examples of
different things
we have on the top we have selling goods
we have this person here
he's a potter a potter is a person who
makes
pots very easy right but they don't just
make pots they might make other things
it looks like this man here is making a
vase or a vase
different pronunciations where you put
flowers into it but
it's a work of art and it's very
beautiful and people will pay money
for these things so he
the main idea of course people do
different kinds of work to earn money
he does a special kind of work he makes
pots so he's called a potter
now a farmer will produce
food they put a lot of work into growing
plants
making sure those plants are healthy
that there is no disease the insects
don't come and eat all the food
when it comes time that the food is
ready to be picked
the farmers go out or they hire people
also to gather all the food
and then they send it to the stores
where we can buy it
and eat it so that's a farmer those
potter and a farmer are two types of
jobs where people
produce or sell things to other people
they have physical objects that they
sell to other people on the bottom we
have
selling services now one example of that
of course we talked about
is a hair stylist some people might call
them
barbers or hairdressers
but a hair stylist means that someone
takes time to you know cut the hair
in a fashionable way of course we like
to
we like to be fashionable right we want
to we don't want a
weird looking haircut you know we want
people to be impressed
with how we look so we go to
hairstylists and we spend lots of money
to make our hair look just right okay
then that's what a hair stylist does
makes us feel good makes us feel happy
about how we look
now another type of person who sells a
service is a shop
assistant now when you go into a
shopping
store or especially a department store
you are overwhelmed so many different
choices
what should i buy which is the best
model you know
how do i try this on if you're buying
clothes well shop assistants they'll
come to you and say may i help you
and you tell them what you're looking
what you're looking for and they will
give you advice
about the best brand the best style
and they will help you if you need to uh
you know where can i try this on okay go
over there
and try it on so they will assist you in
your shopping
uh expedition when you go shopping
it's like an expedition sometimes okay
so we have a couple of sentences
down here money earned
from doing work is called income we
talked about that and
a person's job is called an occupation
so all of these are occupations potter
farmer hair
shop assistant those are different types
of occupations
and these people earn money they earn
income
from doing their jobs okay
the next idea we talked about this very
briefly in the vocabulary section
the next idea is about free enterprise
free enterprise people can create new
goods or services to earn money
if you have a good idea it could be
about
like i said manufacturing something
right making something
or you have an idea about providing a
service
that not many other people are doing you
can
make your own business to do that to
help other people or to provide
goods to them so some people have their
own business ideas they start
and run their own businesses they are
their own bosses right so that's very
interesting
if you have a good idea and you want to
start your own business
then you can become a business owner
and you are the boss you're your own
boss
but it's not always that great
because even though you're your own boss
the customer
is telling you what they want so
actually the customer is the boss and
you're working for a lot of different
people
to make them happy but it can be very
rewarding if you have a good idea
and you like what you're doing so if you
have a good idea think about that right
maybe you could start your own business
help other people
do something provide them a service or
make something new and useful
that many people would like to buy okay
that's
free enterprise
now let's read the reading section and
as usual
i will read aloud you guys repeat after
me or just repeat in your mind
focus on pronunciation and also the
words that we studied
in the vocabulary are you guys ready
let's begin
in the united states people have many
different
occupations each different
occupation requires a different
skill it is important
to get good training so you can be
good at your occupation
if you are very good at something
you can start your own business
in the us free enterprise
means that anyone can start
their own business having your own
business
is quite different from working for
other
people but there are some
similarities between the two
for example whether you work for
yourself
or for others you receive
income income is used to pay bills
and pay for things like food and
services
there are many people who give different
services
to us for instance a hair stylist
and a shop assistant are people who do
service jobs
okay how is the information in this
reading passage organized here we have
main idea
and details so you have a main idea it's
kind of a general statement
and then you have more specific details
or examples
to support or to reinforce that main
idea what is the main idea in this
passage
the main idea is in the u.s people have
many different
people okay so what do we talk about
it's a remember
in the vocabulary section i said it's a
fancy word
for job of course we're talking about
occupation
and because it's many different we have
to put plural occupations
so people have many different
occupations
and of course we repeat that word here
each occupation
requires a different what
a different like i said before you know
some people are good at sports
they're athletic they have good athletic
skills
right they could be a professional
athlete and get an income from
playing sports and entertaining other
people so requires a different
skill
now even if you have skill you still
need to develop that skill how do you
develop that skill well getting good
beep is important to be good at your
occupation so you need to develop that
skill
somebody can who is more experienced can
show you how to use that skill to
perform better at your job and of course
we call that training so getting good
training
is important to be good at your
occupation and you can get training
before you start the job
or you can get training after you start
the job that's called
on the job training okay
next beep means that anyone can start
their own business
it's a concept it's an idea that is very
tightly connected to capitalism and
democracy
a free society and that's the first word
it's two words right
free what's the second word enterprise
right free enterprise
free enterprise means that anyone can
start their own business it's an idea
it's a concept right
that you know you're free to do what you
want to do in a democratic society and
in a capitalist society
you can earn money through your effort
so if you have a good idea
start your own business okay so people
who work for themselves
or others can receive what now whether
you
have your own business or whether you
work for a larger company you work for
other people
who have their own business you receive
money
for the effort for the work that you do
and that money
is called income and income
we generally think of income as regular
uh payments regular amounts of money
that you receive every two weeks
every month and so we call it monthly
income or
yearly income and that's the money that
you get from your job
okay well of course a lot of these
things you don't have to worry about now
when you get older and you graduate from
college
then you will start looking around for a
job you look around for an
occupation for a career a career is
another word
that means you know a career kind of
spans your whole adult life it's like
what different jobs did you do what
field did you work in
or what will your career be you might
start your own business
uh of course i i hope that you live in a
society that believes in free enterprise
so you can start your own business if
you have a good idea
or you could work you know you're just
starting off maybe you don't have a good
idea or you need more training
you need to develop your skills so you
might work with a
large company first or a small company
doesn't matter
however you will earn income so that you
can support yourself and as you grow
later maybe you need to support your
family
as well you need to have a job to
receive that kind of income
so that you can pay for the things you
need to have a good
happy and healthy life okay so that's
kind of interesting
uh kind of a a look into the future for
many of you i'm sure
but in this lesson we talked about
occupations
different types of jobs and we talked
about
free enterprise a little bit so i hope
you learned a lot from this end
from this lesson and hope to see you in
the next
video lesson take care everybody bye bye

03:22
because you need to earn money to pay
03:25
for your housing your food your clothes
03:27
your transportation
03:28
we need money in order to live in our
03:31
society
03:32
so you want to get a job hopefully a job
03:34
that you like
03:35
doing that you are skilled at and from
03:38
that job
03:39
you receive money that money is called
03:42
income
03:42
and income is usually regular amounts of
03:46
money
03:46
every month or every two weeks that you
03:48
receive from doing a job
03:51
and many people will talk about their
03:53
yearly
03:54
income or their monthly income
03:59
next we have service job in
04:02
our society there are many different
04:04
types of jobs there's manufacturing
04:07
jobs where people make things
04:11
but there are also service jobs where
04:13
people they don't make things but they
04:15
provide services they do
04:16
things for other people for example this
04:19
man here
04:19
he is delivering packages right we don't
04:22
have time
04:23
to go to another country or another
04:25
state or somewhere far away
04:28
and get the thing that we want no we buy
04:31
it maybe through the internet
04:33
and then somebody will deliver it to us
04:36
that's a service
04:37
that they provide for us so that is a
04:40
service job
04:41
service job is a job that provides
04:42
people with a
04:44
service such as a mail carrier
04:47
for example this man here or a delivery
04:49
person a bus driver
04:51
bus drivers they provide a service they
04:53
transport you
04:55
from your home to your school or a hair
04:58
stylist
04:58
do you cut your hair by yourself do you
05:01
want your mom to cut your hair
05:04
better to go to a a hair stylist who
05:06
will cut your hair
05:08
in a nice fashionable way that's a
05:10
hairstyles and these are all different
05:12
types
05:12
of service jobs okay that's our
05:15
vocabulary
05:16
for this lesson
05:21
now the first main idea of this lesson
05:24
is
05:25
selling goods and selling services
05:28
now like i said before some people their
05:30
job they
05:31
make things or they produce things other
05:34
people might just
05:36
do useful services for other people so
05:39
we have a couple different examples of
05:40
different things
05:42
we have on the top we have selling goods
05:45
we have this person here
05:46
he's a potter a potter is a person who
05:50
makes
05:51
pots very easy right but they don't just
05:54
make pots they might make other things
05:56
it looks like this man here is making a
05:58
vase or a vase
06:00
different pronunciations where you put
06:01
flowers into it but
06:03
it's a work of art and it's very
06:04
beautiful and people will pay money
06:07
for these things so he
06:11
the main idea of course people do
06:12
different kinds of work to earn money
06:15
he does a special kind of work he makes
06:18
pots so he's called a potter
06:19
now a farmer will produce
06:23
food they put a lot of work into growing
06:25
plants
06:26
making sure those plants are healthy
06:28
that there is no disease the insects
06:30
don't come and eat all the food
06:33
when it comes time that the food is
06:35
ready to be picked
06:36
the farmers go out or they hire people
06:38
also to gather all the food
06:41
and then they send it to the stores
06:43
where we can buy it
06:44
and eat it so that's a farmer those
06:48
potter and a farmer are two types of
06:50
jobs where people
06:52
produce or sell things to other people
06:55
they have physical objects that they
06:57
sell to other people on the bottom we
07:00
have
07:00
selling services now one example of that
07:02
of course we talked about
07:04
is a hair stylist some people might call
07:07
them
07:08
barbers or hairdressers
07:11
but a hair stylist means that someone
07:14
takes time to you know cut the hair
07:16
in a fashionable way of course we like
07:18
to
07:19
we like to be fashionable right we want
07:21
to we don't want a
07:22
weird looking haircut you know we want
07:25
people to be impressed
07:26
with how we look so we go to
07:28
hairstylists and we spend lots of money
07:30
to make our hair look just right okay
07:33
then that's what a hair stylist does
07:35
makes us feel good makes us feel happy
07:38
about how we look
07:39
now another type of person who sells a
07:41
service is a shop
07:43
assistant now when you go into a
07:45
shopping
07:46
store or especially a department store
07:49
you are overwhelmed so many different
07:52
choices
07:53
what should i buy which is the best
07:55
model you know
07:56
how do i try this on if you're buying
07:59
clothes well shop assistants they'll
08:01
come to you and say may i help you
08:02
and you tell them what you're looking
08:04
what you're looking for and they will
08:05
give you advice
08:07
about the best brand the best style
08:10
and they will help you if you need to uh
08:12
you know where can i try this on okay go
08:14
over there
08:15
and try it on so they will assist you in
08:18
your shopping
08:19
uh expedition when you go shopping
08:22
it's like an expedition sometimes okay
08:24
so we have a couple of sentences
08:26
down here money earned
08:29
from doing work is called income we
08:30
talked about that and
08:32
a person's job is called an occupation
08:35
so all of these are occupations potter
08:38
farmer hair
08:39
shop assistant those are different types
08:42
of occupations
08:43
and these people earn money they earn
08:45
income
08:46
from doing their jobs okay
08:50
the next idea we talked about this very
08:52
briefly in the vocabulary section
08:54
the next idea is about free enterprise
08:58
free enterprise people can create new
09:00
goods or services to earn money
09:02
if you have a good idea it could be
09:05
about
09:05
like i said manufacturing something
09:07
right making something
09:09
or you have an idea about providing a
09:11
service
09:12
that not many other people are doing you
09:15
can
09:16
make your own business to do that to
09:18
help other people or to provide
09:21
goods to them so some people have their
09:24
own business ideas they start
09:27
and run their own businesses they are
09:31
their own bosses right so that's very
09:35
interesting
09:35
if you have a good idea and you want to
09:37
start your own business
09:39
then you can become a business owner
09:42
and you are the boss you're your own
09:44
boss
09:46
but it's not always that great
09:49
because even though you're your own boss
09:51
the customer
09:53
is telling you what they want so
09:55
actually the customer is the boss and
09:57
you're working for a lot of different
09:59
people
09:59
to make them happy but it can be very
10:01
rewarding if you have a good idea
10:04
and you like what you're doing so if you
10:05
have a good idea think about that right
10:07
maybe you could start your own business
10:09
help other people
10:10
do something provide them a service or
10:13
make something new and useful
10:15
that many people would like to buy okay
10:17
that's
10:18
free enterprise
10:22
now let's read the reading section and
10:24
as usual
10:25
i will read aloud you guys repeat after
10:28
me or just repeat in your mind
10:30
focus on pronunciation and also the
10:32
