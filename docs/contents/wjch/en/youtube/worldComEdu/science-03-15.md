hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading i'm brian stewart
and in this lesson we're going over
science book 3
lesson 15 the last lesson in the book
and this lesson is talking about sound
waves so this will be interesting right
in this lesson you will discover how
we hear sound and also
how sound can travel
interesting okay
okay as usual we start with the
vocabulary
so the first word is an interesting well
it's actually a combination of
two words it's like a phrase
it is sound wave now this is very
important
sound wave is the energy that you hear
as sound and what is a wave
oh i just drew waves right a wave
is like this this is a wave actually
yeah so these are waves so actually if
you look at the ocean
right you see waves on the ocean but
it's very
similar to how sound travels
through something else okay so
sound will travel in a way many things
travel away
we can't see it right and that's an
interesting thing
you cannot see sound i mean
maybe you can capture images of sound
on a computer or with uh you know some
recording instruments
but we cannot see with our eyes we
cannot see
sound but it travels in a wave
and this is important because as waves
pass through
different objects or different types of
objects
it might slow down or speed up
and that's important we'll talk about
that so sound wave and
the sound if you think about it sound is
just energy
it's energy actually you know i'm
talking to you right now
but how do you hear me it's because i'm
creating
energy with my my larynx in my mouth
and my the air that's coming out of my
lungs all those combine
to create some energy that you can pick
up
and you can distinguish the different
sounds
that i'm making that's interesting to
think about isn't it
so it's the energy that you hear as
sound next we have
echo i'm sure you've had fun right
echoes are kind of
interesting they're they're fun to play
with and echo
is a sound that is heard again
right you hear it again and again
and again okay that's an echo after
it has reflected off a
surface so right that's interesting
because we're coming back to
the sound wave so energy traveling as a
wave
it hits something right and it bounces
off
and it comes back so let me just little
draw
arrows showing the direction of the
movement
right so first this is this is you i'm
not a very good artist
right and you're screaming ah right and
it the sound the energy goes like this
it bounces off an object and comes
back to your ear that's an echo
so if you're in the mountains and there
are many cliffs
right you can say hello hello
hello hello that's the echo that is
coming back to you
we call that phenomenon and echo
okay vibrate
vibrate means that an object moves back
and forth
quickly you know it could have a slow
vibration
but usually vibrations happen very
quickly for an object
to move quickly
fast backward and forward backward and
forward or up and down too
it can also have that uh kind of motion
so for an object to move quickly
backward and forward or
up and down it's just moving like this
that means
vibrate and vibrate is a verb vibration
is a noun vibration
so we'll talk about that of course in
the reading
and it's important to know that word
because it we're talking about
how do you hear sound will come back to
vibrate
okay next tap
tap is a type of hitting something
actually
you know it's in the definition right
here to hit hit
you know when you when one object
collides or comes in contact
with another object that is to hit now
hit there are many
kinds of hits right
and we have many words in english to
describe different
types of hits but a tap
is a certain type of hit it means to hit
something
quickly and lightly so think about this
you are walking and it's very crowded at
your school you're walking down the
hallway
and two people are walking they poop
they bump
into each other bump is another type of
hit
but bump is kind of like tap tap it
but we don't say i tapped into you you'd
say i bumped into you
but if you use your hand right on the
wall
and you just hit it lightly like you
bump into somebody
not not hard not not hard not with a lot
of energy you just
tap it right that's tap now if you hit
it
right you punch it punch is another type
of hit
punch is stronger more energy
punch right so like i said there's many
types of words that we use for hit
different situations tap just means that
you
tap something lightly and quickly
probably when you go to somebody's door
you don't punch the door to get their
attention you
tap on it right tap tap tap knock knock
knock
right to get their attention don't punch
the door
you'll hurt your hand and you'll confuse
the person inside what's going on
okay so tap okay
brain important word right we need our
brains
of course everybody has a brain i hope
your brain is working well of course
it's working well
okay the brain is the thing inside your
head
the organ inside your head it's a thing
yes but
it's an organ to maybe we should say
organ
your body has many different organs and
these different organs
serve different functions the brain is a
very complex
very complicated organ it's
it has many different parts and it works
scientists still don't fully understand
how the brain works how it grows how it
develops
it's a very very mysterious
but interesting and challenging to study
organ in your body that does a specific
thing what does it do
it controls yeah sure it controls your
body that's
one of the things that it does it
controls
the uh the motion of your body it
controls your breathing it controls
many functions of your body that you
need to live
but you also use your brain to think
and to read and to imagine
right so the brain like i said is a very
complex
organ that does many many different
things
okay but it also is very important when
we're talking about
sound next we have
eardrum did you know you have a drum
inside your
ear yes there is okay the eardrum
is the thing in your ear that vibrates
right just like the top of a drum
if you have a drum at home or you you
know you've seen drums before or
maybe you play a drum at school a drum
is like a uh
a small a box like a circular box and it
has a thin
skin of something on top it's stretched
very tight and if you tap it
it makes a sound well that skin or that
fabric or whatever it is that's also
inside your ear both your ears
and when sound hits it it vibrates
and that vibration is what your brain
picks up
and your brain interprets that
vibration as sound and that's how you
are understanding
what i'm saying right now so ear jump
it's very important our eardrums are can
be
fragile so be careful about listening to
very loud sounds
very big sense because your eardrum can
actually be
damaged so be careful don't listen to
music that's very loud
be careful around very loud sounds
sometimes you might want to wear
protection
for your ears to protect your eardrums
next we have clap if you see if you've
gone to a movie or a
usually a play or there's a live event
in front of you some people are playing
music or maybe
even just reading a poem somebody does
something that you like
you hit your hands together you don't
tap your hands
that's odd you hit your hands together
and you make a sound
yay that's to clap and if many people do
it together
that means that they're the they're
everybody is showing their appreciation
good job you've done a great job okay
so those are our words for the lesson
let's talk about the main ideas of this
lesson the first main idea is
of course how we hear sound
now i talked a little bit about this
during the vocabulary section
but there's many steps that need to be
performed
in order for you to hear
a sound of course sound is energy so
that energy has to be made
so first of all a vibrating object
creates sound waves
and again sound waves are energy a
vibrating
object we talked about vibrate right it
moves up and down
or back and forth very quickly well
what's vibrating in the picture if the
boy is playing a violin
the strings on the violin are vibrating
and inside the violin there's an open
area and so the sound is being
magnified it's being made louder and we
can hear that sound
but wait a minute what's vibrating right
now
as i'm speaking to you what's vibrating
is there something vibrating you bet
there is something vibrating
it's in my throat and when you speak
in your throat we call these the vocal
cords
in your throat are vibrating and
you may not be aware of it right this is
something we learn
we don't really think about okay i'm
going to vibrate this chord we don't
think that way
we just learn it by doing it so it's
really an amazing
uh thing when you think about it and how
it works
but the vocal cords in your throat
will vibrate as you make words as you
say words and let me spell that for you
in case you're wondering vocal cords
and your your vocal cords are vibrating
in your throat when you speak
and the way that you vibrate them
and also the way that you shape the
sound as it comes to your mouth
is how other people hear
or distinguish between different sounds
it's not
your vocal cords are vibrating that's
that's producing uh
sound and energy but you're also shaping
that sound
with your teeth your tongue and uh and
your lips
okay and that's how you make different
pronunciations
or different sounds okay so vibrating
object creates sound waves
sound waves move through the air and
remember it's a sound wave so it's
moving through the air like this
it moves through the air remember we are
surrounded by gas we learned that
in a previous lesson so that is the air
there needs to be gas
for the sound to move through there
needs to be something for the
sound to move through in outer space
there's no gas
there's no sound right so if you're
watching a science fiction movie
and you hear explosions that's not
accurate
right that's just drama that's just the
director trying to
trying to create something that we
understand but
we don't live in outer space so we may
not know that there's nothing in outer
space there's no
there's no gas there's nothing so
there's nothing for the sound wave to
move
through space is silent
okay anyway sound waves move through the
air
then after they move through the air
they reach
or they enter your ear and then they hit
your eardrum just inside your ear
and they cause your eardrum to vibrate
so your eardrum will vibrate
in different ways depending on what
sound
is coming to them because sound waves
will move
at different at different
frequencies right they could be very
long right they could be you know just
kind of like this or they could be very
very quick and those are the different
sounds that we hear
so they cause the eardrum to vibrate in
different vibrations and so
our brain a brain hears a sound
our brain interprets i would change that
our brain interprets interprets
interprets the brain
recognizes those signals and changes
them
into words that your brain can
understand and that's
interpretation so you know not that the
brain hears a sound that would require
the brain to have another ear no
the ear is already there the brain just
detects that energy
and changes that energy it knows how to
change that energy into words and of
course how do you do that
you learn that when you were a child
right over
you know weeks months
young children pick up this ability very
quickly their brains
are very good at picking up different
sounds
and translating those sounds into
language
so this is very interesting right we
don't think about this
but it's actually kind of a miracle it's
it's not a miracle of course
there is a scientific reason but it's
really amazing
how it works and how how complex our
brains really are
to be able to do this okay
our next idea is touching upon what i
talked about i got a little ahead of
myself about
how sound travels now as i said before
sound doesn't travel through space
because there's nothing in space
right sound travels through air through
gases i'm going to go backwards because
we start with gases
where normally we hear sound through
gases and
and the gases around us mostly nitrogen
uh 20
about 21 oxygen some other gases in
there
but mostly nitrogen and oxygen are the
gases
in our atmosphere and sound can travel
through those gases
and sound moves and that's you know
sound we're used to
listening to sound move through the air
and of course this is a good example you
can hear an
ambulance or a police car when you're in
a car
and you can hear them very quickly
because the sound is very loud they're
making a lot of energy
and you can hear that sound very quickly
and you can hear
what direction it's coming from so your
mom and dad are like oh there's a
slow down be careful there's an
emergency vehicle coming through
so we hear a lot of sounds through gases
that's our
normal experience with sound
now sound also moves through liquids
now remember when i said that sound
moves in waves
well sound will move and wave in waves
and these waves will be quicker in
some environments than in other
environments underwater sound moves a
lot
faster through water sound moves faster
that's what it says right here
why because we talked about this in a
previous unit
all matter is made up of atoms right in
in
air in gases the atoms are the molecules
of nitrogen and oxygen in gas or
whatever gas it is
they're far away from each other right
there's a lot of space in between
and that's how we can move through gas
very easily
it's like we don't even know it's there
of course if it's windy we know it's
there
but usually we don't think about it if
you go into a swimming pool
it's harder to move because the
molecules of the water
they're closer together it's more dense
so sound can travel between those
molecules its energy
transferring through molecules and it
can move a lot faster
now i like to do i like to go scuba
diving a lot
and one of the things we learn when we
go scuba diving is that sound travels
very quickly
it's so quick that it hits both your
ears at the same time
so if you hear a sound when you're
underwater uh scuba diving or swimming
you don't know where it's coming from
it's hard i mean sometimes you can
figure it out but
it's more difficult because through air
it moves slower
if it hits this ear first and then this
ear my brain knows oh
the sound's coming from over there but
under water since sound moves quickly
it hits both the ears at the same time
it's like where did that sound
come from okay so that's interesting now
it moves even faster through
solids right solids like
glass or wood right on the desk
if you that's why when you knock on
somebody's door their door is wood
and it makes a larger sound of course if
you
if you knock on water that's not going
to make any sense you have to hit the
water really hard to make a sound
but you can just tap on the wood
or the metal or the glass right maybe
your friend tries to get your attention
and you're in the classroom you don't do
this the teacher doesn't like it
but they'll tap their finger or a key on
the window
and it makes a sharp sound you can hear
it because sound moves
fastest right so
that's how sound moves through different
uh different mediums or different
environments gas liquid and
solid sound will move faster in
from gas to liquid to solid
sound moves faster it's interesting okay
okay now it's time to go over the
reading so as usual read along with me
you can read out loud
or practice in your mind think about the
pronunciation the words and also the
meaning
of the words that we learned so are you
ready let's begin
sound is energy
it is created by vibrating objects
a vibrating object creates sound
waves sound waves can
travel through solids liquids
and gases
sound waves enter our ear
and then our ear jump our brain
then hears the sound if you
tap an object it does not
vibrate much and so a soft sound
is made if you hit an
object it vibrates a lot and so a loud
sound
is made it is easier
to hear a loud sound than a soft
sound when you
speak shout or whisper
sound waves come out of your mouth
these sound waves travel to others
and they can hear you this
is how we communicate with
others sound waves can
bounce off objects
if you clap your hands in a room
you might hear an echo the sound waves
bounce off the wall back
to you okay that's our reading
now how is the information in the
reading
organized here we have main idea
and details the main idea is that a
vibrating
object creates sound waves so if an
object vibrates
it creates a sound and
what are the details that support this
well sound waves travel
into our ear and then into our what
what's just inside the ear we talked
about it several times
it's the it's like a a musical
instrument that you hit to make a sound
it's an eardrum ear
drum good our
that then after okay so sound goes into
our ear it hits the eardrum
and then what hears the sound
it's our brain but remember it's a
little weird to say that i think
it your brain cures the sound okay but
the brain
decodes the sound it interprets the
sound
and tells you what the sounds mean
okay when you clap your hands
in a room you might hear a what now
making a clapping sound right
that's kind of a loud sound it's a sharp
sound so it's a
it's a short burst of energy and that
energy goes and hits something
comes back to you and you hear it as
what as
what oh as an echo okay
sorry okay echo okay
you might hear it as an echo you might
hear an
echo so echoes are fun to play with i'm
sorry i play too much okay
so next one if you beep an
object it will not vibrate much
but if you hit it it will vibrate more
so we talked about this right there are
many ways to hit something
right hit that's strong right but what's
a light
hit right if i just do this i'm not yeah
i'm hitting but
it's a very soft hit and we have a
special word for that
and that is to tap tap if you
tap an object that means to hit quickly
and lightly and of course it's not a lot
of energy
so you probably won't hear a sound if
you hit your hands
yes you hear the clap you hear the sound
and that's a that's more energy
so you can hear the sound more okay so
actually this unit it's kind of
interesting right sound waves we can't
see them
and usually we don't even think about
them right we just kind of
take them for granted we just we hear a
lot of sounds
but we don't really think about what's
going on
and for a long time people really didn't
know how
sound was transmitted right
this is one of the discoveries in that
last few hundred years about
sound and how it moves and the fact that
it moves
at different speeds through different
environments it moves at a different
speed through gas
and water and solids and that creates
a lot of things that we just we just
kind of know but we don't
we didn't really know why or how it
worked
so this just touched upon the ideas of
sound
but there's a whole field right there's
a lot to study
about how sound moves and what it is
and if you're interested in this of
course you could pursue a career
into studying these types of things okay
so i hope this
lesson was good for you of course in
this
whole book we've we've covered over 15
lessons in this book and i hope you've
learned a lot of
interesting and amazing things science
is really cool
isn't it because when you study science
you're learning more about the
environment around you
how things work why things are the way
they are
and it's actually a very interesting
field to get into
maybe it's a field you want to get into
when you get older and maybe you can
make some
new discoveries or figure out things
that you know
people took for granted but now you have
a deeper
understanding of those things and how
they work and maybe how you can use that
knowledge
to help other people so i hope you've
enjoyed
learning the lessons in this book and of
course as always
thanks for studying with me i hope to
see in the next book book four
maybe we'll see you there okay take care
everybody see you later

hello everybody
00:09
welcome back to american textbook
00:11
reading i'm brian stewart
00:13
and in this lesson we're going over
00:15
science book 3
00:16
lesson 15 the last lesson in the book
00:20
and this lesson is talking about sound
00:23
waves so this will be interesting right
00:27
in this lesson you will discover how
00:30
we hear sound and also
00:34
how sound can travel
00:37
interesting okay
00:40
okay as usual we start with the
00:43
vocabulary
00:44
so the first word is an interesting well
00:46
it's actually a combination of
00:48
two words it's like a phrase
00:51
it is sound wave now this is very
00:55
important
00:55
sound wave is the energy that you hear
00:59
as sound and what is a wave
01:02
oh i just drew waves right a wave
01:05
is like this this is a wave actually
01:08
yeah so these are waves so actually if
01:10
you look at the ocean
01:12
right you see waves on the ocean but
01:14
it's very
01:15
similar to how sound travels
01:18
through something else okay so
01:22
sound will travel in a way many things
01:25
travel away
01:26
we can't see it right and that's an
01:28
interesting thing
01:29
you cannot see sound i mean
01:33
maybe you can capture images of sound
01:36
on a computer or with uh you know some
01:38
recording instruments
01:40
but we cannot see with our eyes we
01:43
cannot see
01:44
sound but it travels in a wave
01:47
and this is important because as waves
01:50
pass through
01:51
different objects or different types of
01:54
objects
01:55
it might slow down or speed up
01:58
and that's important we'll talk about
02:00
that so sound wave and
02:02
the sound if you think about it sound is
02:05
just energy
02:06
it's energy actually you know i'm
02:08
talking to you right now
02:10
but how do you hear me it's because i'm
02:12
creating
02:13
energy with my my larynx in my mouth
02:18
and my the air that's coming out of my
02:20
lungs all those combine
02:22
to create some energy that you can pick
02:25
up
02:25
and you can distinguish the different
02:28
sounds
02:29
that i'm making that's interesting to
02:31
think about isn't it
02:32
so it's the energy that you hear as
02:36
sound next we have
02:39
echo i'm sure you've had fun right
02:42
echoes are kind of
02:43
interesting they're they're fun to play
02:46
with and echo
02:47
is a sound that is heard again
02:50
right you hear it again and again
02:54
and again okay that's an echo after
02:57
it has reflected off a
03:00
surface so right that's interesting
03:02
because we're coming back to
03:03
the sound wave so energy traveling as a
03:06
wave
03:07
it hits something right and it bounces
03:10
off
03:11
and it comes back so let me just little
03:13
draw
03:14
arrows showing the direction of the
03:17
movement
03:18
right so first this is this is you i'm
03:21
not a very good artist
03:22
right and you're screaming ah right and
03:25
it the sound the energy goes like this
03:27
it bounces off an object and comes
03:30
back to your ear that's an echo
03:34
so if you're in the mountains and there
03:37
are many cliffs
03:38
right you can say hello hello
03:42
hello hello that's the echo that is
03:45
coming back to you
03:46
we call that phenomenon and echo
03:49
okay vibrate
03:54
vibrate means that an object moves back
03:57
and forth
03:59
quickly you know it could have a slow
04:01
vibration
04:02
but usually vibrations happen very
04:04
quickly for an object
04:06
to move quickly
04:09
fast backward and forward backward and
04:13
forward or up and down too
04:14
it can also have that uh kind of motion
04:17
so for an object to move quickly
04:19
backward and forward or
04:21
up and down it's just moving like this
04:23
that means
04:24
vibrate and vibrate is a verb vibration
04:28
is a noun vibration
04:32
so we'll talk about that of course in
04:35
the reading
04:36
and it's important to know that word
04:39
because it we're talking about
04:40
how do you hear sound will come back to
04:43
vibrate
04:43
okay next tap
04:47
tap is a type of hitting something
04:51
actually
04:51
you know it's in the definition right
04:53
here to hit hit
04:55
you know when you when one object
04:58
collides or comes in contact
05:02
with another object that is to hit now
05:04
hit there are many
05:05
kinds of hits right
05:09
and we have many words in english to
05:11
describe different
05:12
types of hits but a tap
05:16
is a certain type of hit it means to hit
05:18
something
05:19
quickly and lightly so think about this
05:23
you are walking and it's very crowded at
05:26
your school you're walking down the
05:28
hallway
05:29
and two people are walking they poop
05:31
they bump
05:32
into each other bump is another type of
05:35
hit
05:36
but bump is kind of like tap tap it
05:39
but we don't say i tapped into you you'd
05:41
say i bumped into you
05:42
but if you use your hand right on the
05:46
wall
05:46
and you just hit it lightly like you
05:48
bump into somebody
05:51
not not hard not not hard not with a lot
05:54
of energy you just
05:56
tap it right that's tap now if you hit
05:59
it
05:59
right you punch it punch is another type
06:02
of hit
06:03
punch is stronger more energy
06:06
punch right so like i said there's many
06:08
types of words that we use for hit
06:11
different situations tap just means that
06:14
you
06:14
tap something lightly and quickly
06:17
probably when you go to somebody's door
06:19
you don't punch the door to get their
06:21
attention you
06:22
tap on it right tap tap tap knock knock
06:25
knock
06:26
right to get their attention don't punch
06:29
the door
06:29
you'll hurt your hand and you'll confuse
06:32
the person inside what's going on
06:34
okay so tap okay
06:38
brain important word right we need our
06:42
brains
06:43
of course everybody has a brain i hope
06:46
your brain is working well of course
06:47
it's working well
06:48
okay the brain is the thing inside your
06:52
head
06:52
the organ inside your head it's a thing
06:55
yes but
06:56
it's an organ to maybe we should say
06:58
organ
06:59
your body has many different organs and
07:01
these different organs
07:02
serve different functions the brain is a
07:04
very complex
07:06
very complicated organ it's
07:10
it has many different parts and it works
07:13
scientists still don't fully understand
07:16
how the brain works how it grows how it
07:19
develops
07:19
it's a very very mysterious
07:23
but interesting and challenging to study
07:27
organ in your body that does a specific
07:29
thing what does it do
07:30
it controls yeah sure it controls your
07:32
body that's
07:33
one of the things that it does it
07:35
controls
07:37
the uh the motion of your body it
07:39
controls your breathing it controls
07:41
many functions of your body that you
07:43
need to live
07:44
but you also use your brain to think
07:48
and to read and to imagine
07:51
right so the brain like i said is a very
07:53
complex
07:54
organ that does many many different
07:57
things
07:58
okay but it also is very important when
08:00
we're talking about
08:01
sound next we have
08:04
eardrum did you know you have a drum
08:07
inside your
08:08
ear yes there is okay the eardrum
08:12
is the thing in your ear that vibrates
08:14
right just like the top of a drum
08:16
if you have a drum at home or you you
08:18
know you've seen drums before or
08:19
maybe you play a drum at school a drum
08:22
is like a uh
08:24
a small a box like a circular box and it
08:26
has a thin
08:28
skin of something on top it's stretched
08:30
very tight and if you tap it
08:32
it makes a sound well that skin or that
08:35
fabric or whatever it is that's also
08:37
inside your ear both your ears
08:40
and when sound hits it it vibrates
08:44
and that vibration is what your brain
08:46
picks up
08:47
and your brain interprets that
08:51
vibration as sound and that's how you
08:54
are understanding
08:55
what i'm saying right now so ear jump
08:59
it's very important our eardrums are can
09:02
be
09:02
fragile so be careful about listening to
09:05
very loud sounds
09:07
very big sense because your eardrum can
09:09
actually be
09:10
damaged so be careful don't listen to
09:12
music that's very loud
09:14
be careful around very loud sounds
09:16
sometimes you might want to wear
09:17
protection
09:18
for your ears to protect your eardrums
09:23
next we have clap if you see if you've
09:26
gone to a movie or a
09:27
usually a play or there's a live event
09:31
in front of you some people are playing
09:33
music or maybe
09:34
even just reading a poem somebody does
09:37
something that you like
09:38
you hit your hands together you don't
09:41
tap your hands
09:42
that's odd you hit your hands together
09:45
and you make a sound
09:48
yay that's to clap and if many people do
09:51
it together
09:52
that means that they're the they're
09:54
everybody is showing their appreciation
09:57
good job you've done a great job okay
10:00
so those are our words for the lesson
10:05
let's talk about the main ideas of this
10:08
lesson the first main idea is
10:11
of course how we hear sound
10:14
now i talked a little bit about this
10:15
during the vocabulary section
10:17
but there's many steps that need to be
10:20
performed
10:21
in order for you to hear
10:24
a sound of course sound is energy so
10:27
that energy has to be made
10:29
so first of all a vibrating object
10:33
creates sound waves
10:36
and again sound waves are energy a
10:38
vibrating
10:39
object we talked about vibrate right it
10:42
moves up and down
10:43
or back and forth very quickly well
10:46
what's vibrating in the picture if the
10:48
boy is playing a violin
10:50
the strings on the violin are vibrating
10:53
and inside the violin there's an open
10:55
area and so the sound is being
10:58
magnified it's being made louder and we
11:01
can hear that sound
11:02
but wait a minute what's vibrating right
11:05
now
11:05
as i'm speaking to you what's vibrating
11:09
is there something vibrating you bet
11:11
there is something vibrating
11:12
it's in my throat and when you speak
11:16
in your throat we call these the vocal
11:18
cords
11:19
in your throat are vibrating and
11:22
you may not be aware of it right this is
11:24
something we learn
11:26
we don't really think about okay i'm
11:28
going to vibrate this chord we don't
11:29
think that way
11:30
we just learn it by doing it so it's
11:33
really an amazing
11:34
uh thing when you think about it and how
11:37
it works
11:37
but the vocal cords in your throat
11:40
will vibrate as you make words as you
11:43
say words and let me spell that for you
11:46
in case you're wondering vocal cords
11:50
and your your vocal cords are vibrating
11:53
in your throat when you speak
11:55
and the way that you vibrate them
11:58
and also the way that you shape the
12:00
sound as it comes to your mouth
12:02
is how other people hear
12:05
or distinguish between different sounds
12:08
it's not
12:08
your vocal cords are vibrating that's
12:10
that's producing uh
12:11
sound and energy but you're also shaping
12:14
that sound
12:15
with your teeth your tongue and uh and
12:18
your lips
12:19
okay and that's how you make different
12:21
pronunciations
12:22
or different sounds okay so vibrating
12:26
object creates sound waves
12:27
sound waves move through the air and
12:29
remember it's a sound wave so it's
12:31
moving through the air like this
12:33
it moves through the air remember we are
12:36
surrounded by gas we learned that
12:38
in a previous lesson so that is the air
12:40
there needs to be gas
12:42
for the sound to move through there
12:44
needs to be something for the
12:46
sound to move through in outer space
12:48
there's no gas
12:49
there's no sound right so if you're
12:52
watching a science fiction movie
12:54
and you hear explosions that's not
12:56
accurate
12:57
right that's just drama that's just the
13:00
director trying to
13:01
trying to create something that we
13:02
understand but
13:04
we don't live in outer space so we may
13:06
not know that there's nothing in outer
13:08
space there's no
13:09
there's no gas there's nothing so
13:11
there's nothing for the sound wave to
13:13
move
13:13
through space is silent
13:17
okay anyway sound waves move through the
13:19
air
13:20
then after they move through the air
13:22
they reach
13:23
or they enter your ear and then they hit
13:26
your eardrum just inside your ear
13:29
and they cause your eardrum to vibrate
13:31
so your eardrum will vibrate
13:33
in different ways depending on what
13:36
sound
13:37
is coming to them because sound waves
13:40
will move
13:41
at different at different
13:44
frequencies right they could be very
13:48
long right they could be you know just
13:50
kind of like this or they could be very
13:54
very quick and those are the different
13:56
sounds that we hear
13:58
so they cause the eardrum to vibrate in
14:00
different vibrations and so
14:02
our brain a brain hears a sound
14:05
our brain interprets i would change that
14:08
our brain interprets interprets
14:13
interprets the brain
14:16
recognizes those signals and changes
14:19
them
14:20
into words that your brain can
14:23
understand and that's
14:24
interpretation so you know not that the
14:26
brain hears a sound that would require
14:28
the brain to have another ear no
14:30
the ear is already there the brain just
14:32
detects that energy
14:33
and changes that energy it knows how to
14:37
change that energy into words and of
14:39
course how do you do that
14:41
you learn that when you were a child
14:43
right over
14:44
you know weeks months
14:48
young children pick up this ability very
14:50
quickly their brains
14:52
are very good at picking up different
14:54
sounds
14:55
and translating those sounds into
14:57
language
14:58
so this is very interesting right we
15:00
don't think about this
15:01
but it's actually kind of a miracle it's
15:03
it's not a miracle of course
15:05
there is a scientific reason but it's
15:07
really amazing
15:09
how it works and how how complex our
15:12
brains really are
15:13
to be able to do this okay
15:16
our next idea is touching upon what i
15:19
talked about i got a little ahead of
15:20
myself about
15:21
how sound travels now as i said before
15:24
sound doesn't travel through space
15:25
because there's nothing in space
15:28
right sound travels through air through
15:31
gases i'm going to go backwards because
15:33
we start with gases
15:34
where normally we hear sound through
15:37
gases and
15:38
and the gases around us mostly nitrogen
15:41
uh 20
15:41
about 21 oxygen some other gases in
15:44
there
15:45
but mostly nitrogen and oxygen are the
15:48
gases
15:49
in our atmosphere and sound can travel
15:51
through those gases
15:53
and sound moves and that's you know
15:55
sound we're used to
15:57
listening to sound move through the air
15:59
and of course this is a good example you
16:01
can hear an
16:02
ambulance or a police car when you're in
16:04
a car
16:05
and you can hear them very quickly
16:07
because the sound is very loud they're
16:09
making a lot of energy
16:10
and you can hear that sound very quickly
16:12
and you can hear
16:13
what direction it's coming from so your
16:15
mom and dad are like oh there's a
16:17
slow down be careful there's an
16:19
emergency vehicle coming through
16:21
so we hear a lot of sounds through gases
16:24
that's our
16:25
normal experience with sound
16:29
now sound also moves through liquids
16:33
now remember when i said that sound
16:35
moves in waves
16:37
well sound will move and wave in waves
16:40
and these waves will be quicker in
16:43
some environments than in other
16:46
environments underwater sound moves a
16:49
lot
16:50
faster through water sound moves faster
16:53
that's what it says right here
16:54
why because we talked about this in a
16:58
previous unit
16:58
all matter is made up of atoms right in
17:01
in
17:02
air in gases the atoms are the molecules
17:05
of nitrogen and oxygen in gas or
17:07
whatever gas it is
17:09
they're far away from each other right
17:10
there's a lot of space in between
17:12
and that's how we can move through gas
17:14
very easily
17:15
it's like we don't even know it's there
17:17
of course if it's windy we know it's
17:19
there
17:19
but usually we don't think about it if
17:21
you go into a swimming pool
17:23
it's harder to move because the
17:25
molecules of the water
17:26
they're closer together it's more dense
17:29
so sound can travel between those
17:32
molecules its energy
17:34
transferring through molecules and it
17:36
can move a lot faster
17:38
now i like to do i like to go scuba
17:40
diving a lot
17:41
and one of the things we learn when we
17:42
go scuba diving is that sound travels
17:45
very quickly
17:46
it's so quick that it hits both your
17:48
ears at the same time
17:50
so if you hear a sound when you're
17:52
underwater uh scuba diving or swimming
17:55
you don't know where it's coming from
17:57
it's hard i mean sometimes you can
17:59
figure it out but
18:00
it's more difficult because through air
18:03
it moves slower
18:04
if it hits this ear first and then this
18:06
ear my brain knows oh
18:08
the sound's coming from over there but
18:10
under water since sound moves quickly
18:12
it hits both the ears at the same time
18:14
it's like where did that sound
18:16
come from okay so that's interesting now
18:19
it moves even faster through
18:23
solids right solids like
18:26
glass or wood right on the desk
18:30
if you that's why when you knock on
18:31
somebody's door their door is wood
18:33
and it makes a larger sound of course if
18:37
you
18:37
if you knock on water that's not going
18:39
to make any sense you have to hit the
18:40
water really hard to make a sound
18:42
but you can just tap on the wood
18:45
or the metal or the glass right maybe
18:47
your friend tries to get your attention
18:49
and you're in the classroom you don't do
18:51
this the teacher doesn't like it
18:52
but they'll tap their finger or a key on
18:55
the window
18:56
and it makes a sharp sound you can hear
18:58
it because sound moves
18:59
fastest right so
19:02
that's how sound moves through different
19:05
uh different mediums or different
19:07
environments gas liquid and
19:10
solid sound will move faster in
19:14
from gas to liquid to solid
19:17
sound moves faster it's interesting okay
19:22
okay now it's time to go over the
19:23
reading so as usual read along with me
19:26
you can read out loud
19:27
or practice in your mind think about the
19:29
pronunciation the words and also the
19:31
meaning
19:32
of the words that we learned so are you
19:34
ready let's begin
19:37
sound is energy
19:41
it is created by vibrating objects
19:47
a vibrating object creates sound
19:50
waves sound waves can
19:53
travel through solids liquids
19:57
and gases
20:01
sound waves enter our ear
20:04
and then our ear jump our brain
20:07
then hears the sound if you
20:11
tap an object it does not
20:14
vibrate much and so a soft sound
20:18
is made if you hit an
20:21
object it vibrates a lot and so a loud
20:25
sound
20:26
is made it is easier
20:29
to hear a loud sound than a soft
20:32
sound when you
20:36
speak shout or whisper
20:39
sound waves come out of your mouth
20:42
these sound waves travel to others
20:46
and they can hear you this
20:49
is how we communicate with
20:52
others sound waves can
20:57
bounce off objects
21:00
if you clap your hands in a room
21:03
you might hear an echo the sound waves
21:07
bounce off the wall back
21:10
to you okay that's our reading
21:16
now how is the information in the
21:19
reading
21:19
organized here we have main idea
21:23
and details the main idea is that a
21:26
vibrating
21:27
object creates sound waves so if an
21:30
object vibrates
21:31
it creates a sound and
21:34
what are the details that support this
21:36
well sound waves travel
21:39
into our ear and then into our what
21:42
what's just inside the ear we talked
21:43
about it several times
21:45
it's the it's like a a musical
21:48
instrument that you hit to make a sound
21:50
it's an eardrum ear
21:54
drum good our
21:59
that then after okay so sound goes into
22:01
our ear it hits the eardrum
22:03
and then what hears the sound
22:06
it's our brain but remember it's a
22:08
little weird to say that i think
22:12
it your brain cures the sound okay but
22:14
the brain
22:16
decodes the sound it interprets the
22:18
sound
22:19
and tells you what the sounds mean
22:22
okay when you clap your hands
22:26
in a room you might hear a what now
22:28
making a clapping sound right
22:32
that's kind of a loud sound it's a sharp
22:34
sound so it's a
22:35
it's a short burst of energy and that
22:37
energy goes and hits something
22:39
comes back to you and you hear it as
22:41
what as
22:42
what oh as an echo okay
22:45
sorry okay echo okay
22:49
you might hear it as an echo you might
22:51
hear an
22:52
echo so echoes are fun to play with i'm
22:55
sorry i play too much okay
22:56
so next one if you beep an
22:59
object it will not vibrate much
23:03
but if you hit it it will vibrate more
23:07
so we talked about this right there are
23:08
many ways to hit something
23:10
right hit that's strong right but what's
23:13
a light
23:14
hit right if i just do this i'm not yeah
23:17
i'm hitting but
23:18
it's a very soft hit and we have a
23:21
special word for that
23:22
and that is to tap tap if you
23:26
tap an object that means to hit quickly
23:29
and lightly and of course it's not a lot
23:31
of energy
23:31
so you probably won't hear a sound if
23:34
you hit your hands
23:36
yes you hear the clap you hear the sound
23:38
and that's a that's more energy
23:40
so you can hear the sound more okay so
23:44
actually this unit it's kind of
23:45
interesting right sound waves we can't
23:47
see them
23:48
and usually we don't even think about
23:50
them right we just kind of
23:51
take them for granted we just we hear a
23:54
lot of sounds
23:55
but we don't really think about what's
23:57
going on
23:58
and for a long time people really didn't
24:00
know how
24:01
sound was transmitted right
24:05
this is one of the discoveries in that
24:07
last few hundred years about
24:09
sound and how it moves and the fact that
24:12
it moves
24:13
at different speeds through different
24:16
environments it moves at a different
24:17
speed through gas
24:18
and water and solids and that creates
24:22
a lot of things that we just we just
24:23
kind of know but we don't
24:25
we didn't really know why or how it
24:28
worked
24:28
so this just touched upon the ideas of
24:32
sound
24:32
but there's a whole field right there's
24:34
a lot to study
24:35
about how sound moves and what it is
24:38
and if you're interested in this of
24:40
course you could pursue a career
24:42
into studying these types of things okay
24:45
so i hope this
24:46
lesson was good for you of course in
24:49
