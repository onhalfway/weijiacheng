hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading series
i'm brian stewart today we're looking at
social studies book three
lesson four and in this lesson it's
called
we are citizens you will discover
what citizens do and what
freedoms we have interesting
okay well let's begin with the
vocabulary
our first word is protect
protect means to keep something
or someone from harm if you
prevent something bad
from happening to yourself or to
somebody
else you protect
yourself or somebody else
in this case a police officer protects
people okay in the next
one we have solve solve
is to find an answer to a problem
so of course if you do you like math if
you have a math
problem you try to solve it
but there are many problems we can solve
and sometimes we play games to solve
games as well for example
if you like to put a puzzle
a puzzle together a puzzle how do you
spell
puzzle p p-u-z-z-l-e
this is a puzzle
if you put the puzzle together when you
finished it
you have solved the puzzle
so to solve is to find an answer to
something
next we have consequence
consequence that's a big word right it's
a big meaning too
the consequent is the result of
something that you do if you do
something
what happens that thing that happens
that is the consequence if you do
something
bad the policeman comes
and takes you away to jail that is the
consequence don't worry about that don't
do anything bad
okay okay next we have
permit permit
not permit permit is a noun permit
is a verb permit to permit
someone permit is a noun it's a piece of
paper
that allows you to do something or some
card or
id that allows you to do something so to
permit
is to let someone do something
so if you have a permit in your car
you are permitted to park in this
parking spot
okay so permit to permit sorry to permit
to permit and i have a permit
okay permit verb permit
noun okay
jail okay we talked about consequence
before
right if somebody does something very
bad
they break the law they might
go to jail well they should go to jail
depends on what they did
jail of course is a place where people
go when they break
the law this person is in jail
he's not happy right and of course he's
wearing the prisoner
uniform the typical classic prisoner
uniform
because he's in jail okay
next we have respect it's a good word
it's an important word respect to admire
someone or something for their good
qualities here we have a picture it's
important to respect
older people because they're wise they
have a lot of experience
you can also respect things you can
respect laws
for example you should respect police
officers
you should respect the laws of your
country you should respect your parents
of course okay so respect you should
also respect each other
as human beings very important
so respect is a big word it's small
respect seems like a small word
but it's a really big idea okay
okay that's our vocabulary for this
lesson
next we'll take a look at some other
ideas
in this unit the first idea we have
is what citizens should do for a happier
society
what should citizens do for a happier
society
we all live together in a neighborhood
a town a city a country
uh in a society in on the planet earth
right this these are different levels of
society
and we all want to be happy we all want
to get along
so what should we do together well first
citizens they should solve difficult
problems together there are many
problems that we might have
during our life if we work together to
solve them then we can solve them
some problems we can't solve if we're
only one person
we all have to work together to solve
those problems
so we should solve difficult problems
together
difficult problems like crime pollution
things like those types of problems are
very difficult to solve
but we can do it if we work together
also we should take care of each other
citizens should take care of each other
sometimes we're strong but we're not
always strong
right sometimes we need help so we
should always
try to help other people and they will
help us when we need it
right if we all help each other then we
will all be happier
so if you see somebody who needs your
help help them
and they will be happier for it you will
be happier for it too
okay another thing that citizens should
do
in society is should they should treat
each other or they should treat others
with respect so treat others
with respect this is kind of a the very
basic law of getting along with other
people
law rule whatever you want to call it if
you just respect
other people then everybody will be
happy
so even if you disagree with somebody or
even if you may
maybe there's something about them you
don't like
don't worry about that don't focus on
that remember you still should treat
them
with respect still respect other people
even if you're having a hard time
getting along with them or maybe you
don't like them or their ideas
that's okay still treat them with
respect
because you want to be treated with
respect too
okay now those are the things that
citizens should do for a happier society
now what are our rights in a society
in a in a free and happy society
we have many rights and these are things
these are like
freedoms that we have these are things
that we should have
from our society well first of all very
important
especially in democratic countries is
the freedom
of speech this is so important it's the
first amendment
in the united states constitution
it is called the first amendment freedom
of speech
and that means we can say anything
we want to as long as it's true right
and as long as we don't uh intend to
hurt other people
so you have the right to say whatever
your opinion is
that is your right in a democratic
society
if you don't agree with the government
it's okay you can
voice your opinion you can say why you
don't agree with them
so freedom of speech is a very important
right in a democratic society
next we have freedom of religion
that means that the government cannot
tell you
which religion you have to follow
right they can't tell you oh you have to
be a christian
or you have to be jewish or you have to
be muslim
they the government cannot tell you that
in a free and democratic society
because you have the right to choose and
if you don't want to have a religion
you have that freedom as well you don't
have to follow
a religion the government has no right
to tell you what religion you
have to follow it's up to you it's your
choice
a lot of these are about choice right in
a free and
happy society people can choose
what they want to do with their lives
they can choose what to say
they can choose what they want to
worship or if they want to worship at
all
you also have the freedom to privacy
freedom to privacy means well i'm just
laughing because the girl
is looking at the picture on her on her
door to her room in her house boy's not
allowed
so she wants to have her own private
space
she doesn't want her brothers coming
into her room
suddenly right she's like stay out but
privacy also means that you have the
right in your home
to do whatever you want to do nobody can
come inside of your home
without uh proper reason
or they can't just come into your home
and you know bother you
you have the right to privacy you also
have a right to privacy
certain rights to privacy when you're
walking around
when you're out in public you have some
rights to privacy as well
so that other people don't bother you
when you're just minding your own
business
freedom of the press well freedom of
speech and freedom of the press are very
closely connected right
freedom of the press what is the press
we also call it the media
the press involves newspapers radio
stations television stations and
nowadays the internet as well
this is all the press it's mass media
and what that means
again it's similar to the freedom of
speech is that the press
the newspapers can publish whatever
information they want to
they don't have to publish information
that is only
approved by the government now they can
voice their own opinion they have to be
it has to be true though
you can't spread a uh well if you
i'm sorry sometimes people do spread
lies but
if it hurts other people then they can
get in trouble
so but basically they have the right the
freedom of press is that newspapers have
the right
to print whatever they want to as long
as it's an opinion
as long as it's their opinion they can
they have that right it's very closely
related to the freedom of speech
now also very important in a
capitalistic society
capitalistic and democratic society is
that you have the right to own your own
property
if you want to buy some land and you
have the money
you have the right to buy that land that
is your private
property and you have the right to
privacy
on your private property the government
cannot go on to your private property
unless they have a very special reason
to do so
and they need a judge to give them that
reason
so you have the freedom to own property
you can own your own house
you can own your own apartment you can
own your own land
so these are all rights of a citizen and
as you can see
there are many freedoms that we enjoy
and as i said before many of these
freedoms
are centered on allowing you to choose
what's best for you choose what makes
you happy
nobody can has the right to tell you
what to say
to tell you where to live to tell you
what to worship or to worship at all
or to come into your private space
unannounced and bother you
you have many freedoms in other words
and that's what we need in a democratic
and free
society okay let's move on to the
reading
okay are you ready let's begin with the
reading and as you can see
this is based on american society but of
course it's very true for many
open democratic societies around the
world
this is also very true for them as well
unfortunately not everybody lives in a
free and democratic society and that's
that's unfortunate there are some
countries where people
are not free and it's it's a tragedy
and uh but anyway that's uh that's
current politics that's
that's uh that's that's news you should
be lucky that you live
in a democratic and free society let's
read about it
okay we are citizens and we all
live together in a society
we live with our family and protect
people
we care for and love
together we are able to solve
difficult problems that come up
come up means to happen of course life
isn't perfect some problems might come
up
but together we can solve them okay next
because we live with other people
we should take care of each other and
treat
other people with respect
very important next
each person in society should
think of others before they do
something our actions
have consequences
this is a very popular or common saying
in english
actions have consequences so be careful
what you do
if you do good actions you have good
consequences
if you do bad actions you have bad
consequences
so remember that okay
if people do something that society does
not
permit that can bring
bad consequences
in such cases those people may go
to jail in jail
they have to make up for
the bad things that they have done
make up for i want to point this out
make up for means that they have to
they did something bad so now they have
to make it right
right if you do something
that makes your brother or sister feel
bad
you need to do something good to make
them
feel better you want to make up for
your bad action so to make up for means
you need to do
something to make your past
bad action okay it's still not okay but
at least
you show that you've learned that you
will not do it again
you need to make up for your mistake
or the bad thing that you did okay
if we love and respect others
our society will be a happier place to
live in
let's remember this when we talk to
other people each day
so very important right even when you
talk to each other
remember like i said before even if you
don't
agree with other people you should still
respect them right respect others
and try to love everybody love is very
important
just show love and respect for other
people and of course
society will be a much happier place to
live in
wouldn't that be great to have a happy
and good society that's what this
article is about so it's a good article
and it shows that as citizens we are
supposed to do some things
and we also if we do those things we can
enjoy many freedoms
okay let's uh take a closer look
at the reading
how is this reading organized we can see
that it is organized
along the lines of cause and effect
cause and effect cause is something that
you do
if you do something that is a cause
and the result of that action is the
effect
remember we learned actions have
consequences action is the cause
consequence is the effect okay
so let's take a look at the cause and
the effect
of different things for example
people do something that society
does not what
in the reading that society does not
remember the
word that we learned in the vocabulary
and it's a verb not a noun in this case
people do something that society does
not
per mit
permit oops t
there we go and are
there we go okay so people do something
that society does not
permit okay good what that's the cause
right that's their action
what is the consequence of their action
what is the effect the effect is
that they may go to remember
the sad guy behind the bars
he's in jail so
people do something that society does
not permit they may
go to jail okay cause
and effect next we have we love
and peep other citizens remember this is
a very important word and it's something
that we should all
do we love and
respect other citizens
respect
we love and respect other citizens if we
do that what will the effect be
the effect will be our society will be a
happier place
to live in and that's true right so
remember love and respect
other people always i love and respect
you guys
okay so thank you for studying with me
and i hope you've learned some good
words
and some important concepts about the
society
in which we live okay thanks for
studying with me
and we'll see you in the next one take
care everybody bye bye

hello everybody
00:09
welcome back to american textbook
00:11
reading series
00:12
i'm brian stewart today we're looking at
00:15
social studies book three
00:17
lesson four and in this lesson it's
00:20
called
00:21
we are citizens you will discover
00:24
what citizens do and what
00:27
freedoms we have interesting
00:31
okay well let's begin with the
00:32
vocabulary
00:35
our first word is protect
00:38
protect means to keep something
00:41
or someone from harm if you
00:45
prevent something bad
00:48
from happening to yourself or to
00:51
somebody
00:52
else you protect
00:55
yourself or somebody else
00:58
in this case a police officer protects
01:02
people okay in the next
01:05
one we have solve solve
01:08
is to find an answer to a problem
01:12
so of course if you do you like math if
01:16
you have a math
01:17
problem you try to solve it
01:20
but there are many problems we can solve
01:23
and sometimes we play games to solve
01:27
games as well for example
01:30
if you like to put a puzzle
01:34
a puzzle together a puzzle how do you
01:37
spell
01:38
puzzle p p-u-z-z-l-e
01:41
this is a puzzle
01:44
if you put the puzzle together when you
01:47
finished it
01:48
you have solved the puzzle
01:51
so to solve is to find an answer to
01:54
something
01:56
next we have consequence
02:00
consequence that's a big word right it's
02:03
a big meaning too
02:05
the consequent is the result of
02:08
something that you do if you do
02:11
something
02:12
what happens that thing that happens
02:16
that is the consequence if you do
02:20
something
02:21
bad the policeman comes
02:25
and takes you away to jail that is the
02:28
consequence don't worry about that don't
02:31
do anything bad
02:32
okay okay next we have
02:37
permit permit
02:41
not permit permit is a noun permit
02:45
is a verb permit to permit
02:49
someone permit is a noun it's a piece of
02:52
paper
02:53
that allows you to do something or some
02:56
card or
02:57
id that allows you to do something so to
03:00
permit
03:01
is to let someone do something
03:04
so if you have a permit in your car
03:08
you are permitted to park in this
03:11
parking spot
03:12
okay so permit to permit sorry to permit
03:16
to permit and i have a permit
03:20
okay permit verb permit
03:24
noun okay
03:27
jail okay we talked about consequence
03:30
before
03:30
right if somebody does something very
03:33
bad
03:34
they break the law they might
03:37
go to jail well they should go to jail
03:40
depends on what they did
03:43
jail of course is a place where people
03:45
go when they break
03:47
the law this person is in jail
03:51
he's not happy right and of course he's
03:53
wearing the prisoner
03:55
uniform the typical classic prisoner
03:59
uniform
04:00
because he's in jail okay
04:04
next we have respect it's a good word
04:07
it's an important word respect to admire
04:11
someone or something for their good
04:14
qualities here we have a picture it's
04:16
important to respect
04:18
older people because they're wise they
04:20
have a lot of experience
04:23
you can also respect things you can
04:25
respect laws
04:27
for example you should respect police
04:30
officers
04:31
you should respect the laws of your
04:33
country you should respect your parents
04:35
of course okay so respect you should
04:38
also respect each other
04:40
as human beings very important
04:43
so respect is a big word it's small
04:46
respect seems like a small word
04:47
but it's a really big idea okay
04:51
okay that's our vocabulary for this
04:53
lesson
04:54
next we'll take a look at some other
04:57
ideas
04:58
in this unit the first idea we have
05:02
is what citizens should do for a happier
05:06
society
05:07
what should citizens do for a happier
05:09
society
05:10
we all live together in a neighborhood
05:14
a town a city a country
05:17
uh in a society in on the planet earth
05:20
right this these are different levels of
05:23
society
05:24
and we all want to be happy we all want
05:26
to get along
05:28
so what should we do together well first
05:32
citizens they should solve difficult
05:36
problems together there are many
05:38
problems that we might have
05:40
during our life if we work together to
05:43
solve them then we can solve them
05:45
some problems we can't solve if we're
05:47
only one person
05:49
we all have to work together to solve
05:52
those problems
05:53
so we should solve difficult problems
05:56
together
05:57
difficult problems like crime pollution
06:00
things like those types of problems are
06:03
very difficult to solve
06:05
but we can do it if we work together
06:09
also we should take care of each other
06:11
citizens should take care of each other
06:14
sometimes we're strong but we're not
06:17
always strong
06:18
right sometimes we need help so we
06:20
should always
06:21
try to help other people and they will
06:24
help us when we need it
06:25
right if we all help each other then we
06:28
will all be happier
06:29
so if you see somebody who needs your
06:31
help help them
06:33
and they will be happier for it you will
06:35
be happier for it too
06:37
okay another thing that citizens should
06:41
do
06:42
in society is should they should treat
06:45
each other or they should treat others
06:48
with respect so treat others
06:51
with respect this is kind of a the very
06:55
basic law of getting along with other
06:58
people
06:59
law rule whatever you want to call it if
07:01
you just respect
07:03
other people then everybody will be
07:05
happy
07:06
so even if you disagree with somebody or
07:09
even if you may
07:10
maybe there's something about them you
07:12
don't like
07:14
don't worry about that don't focus on
07:16
that remember you still should treat
07:18
them
07:19
with respect still respect other people
07:22
even if you're having a hard time
07:24
getting along with them or maybe you
07:26
don't like them or their ideas
07:28
that's okay still treat them with
07:31
respect
07:31
because you want to be treated with
07:33
respect too
07:34
okay now those are the things that
07:37
citizens should do for a happier society
07:40
now what are our rights in a society
07:44
in a in a free and happy society
07:48
we have many rights and these are things
07:51
these are like
07:52
freedoms that we have these are things
07:54
that we should have
07:55
from our society well first of all very
07:58
important
07:59
especially in democratic countries is
08:01
the freedom
08:02
of speech this is so important it's the
08:06
first amendment
08:07
in the united states constitution
08:11
it is called the first amendment freedom
08:13
of speech
08:15
and that means we can say anything
08:18
we want to as long as it's true right
08:21
and as long as we don't uh intend to
08:25
hurt other people
08:26
so you have the right to say whatever
08:29
your opinion is
08:30
that is your right in a democratic
08:33
society
08:34
if you don't agree with the government
08:35
it's okay you can
08:38
voice your opinion you can say why you
08:39
don't agree with them
08:41
so freedom of speech is a very important
08:44
right in a democratic society
08:47
next we have freedom of religion
08:51
that means that the government cannot
08:54
tell you
08:56
which religion you have to follow
08:59
right they can't tell you oh you have to
09:02
be a christian
09:03
or you have to be jewish or you have to
09:05
be muslim
09:06
they the government cannot tell you that
09:09
in a free and democratic society
09:12
because you have the right to choose and
09:13
if you don't want to have a religion
09:16
you have that freedom as well you don't
09:18
have to follow
09:19
a religion the government has no right
09:22
to tell you what religion you
09:26
have to follow it's up to you it's your
09:28
choice
09:30
a lot of these are about choice right in
09:32
a free and
09:33
happy society people can choose
09:37
what they want to do with their lives
09:39
they can choose what to say
09:41
they can choose what they want to
09:44
worship or if they want to worship at
09:45
all
09:46
you also have the freedom to privacy
09:50
freedom to privacy means well i'm just
09:53
laughing because the girl
09:55
is looking at the picture on her on her
09:58
door to her room in her house boy's not
10:01
allowed
10:02
so she wants to have her own private
10:04
space
10:05
she doesn't want her brothers coming
10:07
into her room
10:09
suddenly right she's like stay out but
10:12
privacy also means that you have the
10:13
right in your home
10:15
to do whatever you want to do nobody can
10:18
come inside of your home
10:20
without uh proper reason
10:23
or they can't just come into your home
10:25
and you know bother you
10:26
you have the right to privacy you also
10:28
have a right to privacy
10:30
certain rights to privacy when you're
10:32
walking around
10:33
when you're out in public you have some
10:35
rights to privacy as well
10:38
so that other people don't bother you
10:40
when you're just minding your own
10:42
business
10:44
freedom of the press well freedom of
10:46
speech and freedom of the press are very
10:48
closely connected right
10:50
freedom of the press what is the press
10:52
we also call it the media
10:54
the press involves newspapers radio
10:58
stations television stations and
11:00
nowadays the internet as well
11:03
this is all the press it's mass media
11:06
and what that means
11:07
again it's similar to the freedom of
11:09
speech is that the press
11:11
the newspapers can publish whatever
11:13
information they want to
11:15
they don't have to publish information
11:18
that is only
11:18
approved by the government now they can
11:21
voice their own opinion they have to be
11:23
it has to be true though
11:25
you can't spread a uh well if you
11:28
i'm sorry sometimes people do spread
11:30
lies but
11:32
if it hurts other people then they can
11:35
get in trouble
11:36
so but basically they have the right the
11:39
freedom of press is that newspapers have
11:40
the right
11:41
to print whatever they want to as long
11:43
as it's an opinion
11:44
as long as it's their opinion they can
11:48
they have that right it's very closely
11:50
related to the freedom of speech
11:52
now also very important in a
11:55
capitalistic society
11:57
capitalistic and democratic society is
12:00
that you have the right to own your own
12:02
property
12:03
if you want to buy some land and you
12:06
have the money
12:06
you have the right to buy that land that
12:09
is your private
12:10
property and you have the right to
12:12
privacy
12:13
on your private property the government
12:16
cannot go on to your private property
12:18
unless they have a very special reason
12:20
to do so
12:21
and they need a judge to give them that
12:23
reason
12:25
so you have the freedom to own property
12:27
you can own your own house
12:28
you can own your own apartment you can
12:30
own your own land
12:32
so these are all rights of a citizen and
12:35
as you can see
12:35
there are many freedoms that we enjoy
12:38
and as i said before many of these
12:40
freedoms
12:41
are centered on allowing you to choose
12:46
what's best for you choose what makes
12:49
you happy
12:50
nobody can has the right to tell you
12:53
what to say
12:54
to tell you where to live to tell you
12:57
what to worship or to worship at all
13:00
or to come into your private space
13:03
unannounced and bother you
13:04
you have many freedoms in other words
13:08
and that's what we need in a democratic
13:10
and free
13:11
society okay let's move on to the
13:14
reading
13:17
okay are you ready let's begin with the
13:19
reading and as you can see
13:21
this is based on american society but of
13:23
course it's very true for many
13:25
open democratic societies around the
13:28
world
13:29
this is also very true for them as well
13:33
unfortunately not everybody lives in a
13:35
free and democratic society and that's
13:37
that's unfortunate there are some
13:39
countries where people
13:41
are not free and it's it's a tragedy
13:44
and uh but anyway that's uh that's
13:47
current politics that's
13:48
that's uh that's that's news you should
13:51
be lucky that you live
13:52
in a democratic and free society let's
13:55
read about it
13:55
okay we are citizens and we all
13:59
live together in a society
14:02
we live with our family and protect
14:05
people
14:06
we care for and love
14:11
together we are able to solve
14:14
difficult problems that come up
14:18
come up means to happen of course life
14:21
isn't perfect some problems might come
14:24
up
14:24
but together we can solve them okay next
14:29
because we live with other people
14:32
we should take care of each other and
14:35
treat
14:36
other people with respect
14:39
very important next
14:43
each person in society should
14:46
think of others before they do
14:49
something our actions
14:52
have consequences
14:55
this is a very popular or common saying
14:58
in english
14:59
actions have consequences so be careful
15:03
what you do
15:04
if you do good actions you have good
15:06
consequences
15:08
if you do bad actions you have bad
15:11
consequences
15:12
so remember that okay
15:15
if people do something that society does
15:19
not
15:20
permit that can bring
15:23
bad consequences
15:26
in such cases those people may go
15:29
to jail in jail
15:33
they have to make up for
15:36
the bad things that they have done
15:41
make up for i want to point this out
15:44
make up for means that they have to
15:48
they did something bad so now they have
15:51
to make it right
15:52
right if you do something
15:56
that makes your brother or sister feel
15:59
bad
16:00
you need to do something good to make
16:03
them
16:03
feel better you want to make up for
16:06
your bad action so to make up for means
16:10
you need to do
16:11
something to make your past
16:14
bad action okay it's still not okay but
16:18
at least
16:19
you show that you've learned that you
16:21
will not do it again
16:22
you need to make up for your mistake
16:26
or the bad thing that you did okay
16:30
if we love and respect others
16:34
our society will be a happier place to
16:37
live in
16:39
let's remember this when we talk to
16:42
other people each day
16:45
so very important right even when you
16:48
talk to each other
16:49
remember like i said before even if you
16:52
don't
16:52
agree with other people you should still
16:56
respect them right respect others
16:59
and try to love everybody love is very
17:02
important
17:03
just show love and respect for other
17:05
people and of course
17:07
society will be a much happier place to
17:10
live in
17:11
wouldn't that be great to have a happy
17:14
and good society that's what this
17:16
article is about so it's a good article
17:18
and it shows that as citizens we are
17:21
supposed to do some things
17:23
and we also if we do those things we can
17:25
enjoy many freedoms
17:28
okay let's uh take a closer look
17:31
at the reading
17:34
how is this reading organized we can see
17:37
that it is organized
17:39
along the lines of cause and effect
17:43
cause and effect cause is something that
17:46
you do
17:47
if you do something that is a cause
17:50
and the result of that action is the
17:52
effect
17:53
remember we learned actions have
17:57
consequences action is the cause
18:00
consequence is the effect okay
18:03
so let's take a look at the cause and
18:06
the effect
18:06
of different things for example
18:10
people do something that society
18:14
does not what
18:17
in the reading that society does not
18:20
remember the
18:21
word that we learned in the vocabulary
18:24
and it's a verb not a noun in this case
18:28
people do something that society does
18:30
not
18:32
per mit
18:35
permit oops t
18:38
there we go and are
18:42
there we go okay so people do something
18:45
that society does not
18:46
permit okay good what that's the cause
18:50
right that's their action
18:51
what is the consequence of their action
18:54
what is the effect the effect is
18:56
that they may go to remember
19:00
the sad guy behind the bars
19:03
he's in jail so
19:08
people do something that society does
19:10
not permit they may
19:11
go to jail okay cause
19:14
and effect next we have we love
19:18
and peep other citizens remember this is
19:22
a very important word and it's something
19:24
that we should all
19:25
do we love and
19:28
respect other citizens
19:34
respect
19:36
we love and respect other citizens if we
19:39
do that what will the effect be
19:41
the effect will be our society will be a
19:45
happier place
