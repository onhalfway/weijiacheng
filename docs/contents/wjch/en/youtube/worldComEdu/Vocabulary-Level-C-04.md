hello everybody
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
are you ready to continue with the
lessons
great because we're going to be starting
today with lesson four
the unit title is dynamic earth and our
lesson title
is fire under the earth do you know
there's a fire under the earth we're
going to talk about that
in this lesson so we will focus on
let's learn about a volcano
do you know what a volcano is well we
have a video here
of what a volcano looks like i'm sure
you've seen them on television right
here we have a mountain as you can see
and look at this
there's fire coming out of the mountain
let's look at the video
okay wow look at that all of this fire
is coming out
from the top of the mountain where is it
coming from
well it's coming from deep below the
surface of the earth
and that's what our lesson is about
today
now before we get into uh too much into
the lesson of course
we have to review some important
vocabulary words
so let's begin with the first one
the first one we have a picture here
this looks like
yellowstone national park which is a
park
a very famous park in america where
hot water comes out of the ground it
comes out
very suddenly and in great volume
it suddenly comes up shoots up into the
sky
now there is a very specific verb
we can use to describe exactly
that action what is that verb that verb
is
gush to gush so we use to gush
to explain when something suddenly
and in a lot of volume comes out
not just of the earth you know sometimes
people gush too do you have a friend
who talks very fast and very quickly and
they say a whole lot of stuff
they are gushing so you can say my
friend
gushes right that means that they're
talking very quickly
and they are saying many things very
suddenly
so many things gush right
of course in this lesson we're going to
be talking about things that gush
from up under the earth okay let's move
on to the next word
here we have some three pictures or a
picture of three objects right
and it says water or oil but really to
be
honest it's not just water or
oil it's any substance that
doesn't have a shape that you can pour
into a container you can pour out of a
container
if you pour it out it flows over the
ground
or it goes into the ground what type of
substance is that we say that that is
liquid liquid right liquid
it's liquid water is liquid oil is
liquid
that video that we saw of the volcano
that's actually liquid rock
isn't that amazing rock can be liquid
we'll talk about that some more later
okay the next one
wow this looks very very very
old doesn't it when we look at something
like this
these are ruins right ruins
from a very very old civilization
you've probably read about rome or a
long
long time ago in china or even in korea
we can see ruins they're very old
another word for very old it's an
adjective that we use
it's ancient ancient
it's a little bit maybe a difficult word
so ain't
chint ancient ancient
these are ancient ruins okay let's move
on
wow very neat picture that's really cool
looking isn't it very beautiful right
here of course we can see another
volcano this is another volcano here
and actually we can see many volcanoes
right
to throw out violently if something is
being
thrown out violently what do we say we
say
it's erupting to erupt when a volcano
begins to throw out the very
hot rock and smoke and
ash and also ash ashes you know when you
have a fire
and the smoke goes out sometimes pieces
of the
of the smoke fall from the sky onto your
arm right
that's ash it's actually pieces of the
wood that fly up in the air
and come down on your arm so ash all of
this stuff
smoke ash molten rock is
thrown out of the volcano when the
volcano
erupts okay next word
now we're talking a lot right i keep
talking about the hot melted rock
but there's a better word for it right
there's a better word for it
the hot melted rock that comes out of a
volcano
we have a specific word for it what is
it
it's called lava right before i taught
you
ash that's one of the things that comes
out of a volcano
the other one is smoke and finally we
have
lava lava is very dangerous isn't it
it's uh it's also difficult to pronounce
lava
lava okay it's hot melted rock
imagine rock that is
so hot it's red and it's
liquid don't go near that it's really
dangerous right
so you should not be close to a volcano
when it erupts right because if the lava
touches you
that's really dangerous so you don't
want to be close
to the lava okay
here's a cute picture what's going on
with this kitten right
it's a kitten a baby cat a kitten so it
was
born not long ago
another word for not long ago we can say
recently recently so when we add
l-y it's an adverb it describes you know
when it happened recently
recent well how recent it was recently
okay
so recently means it was not long
ago recently a little bit difficult
pronunciation
re sent lee recently
recently remember recent is just an
adjective
recently add l y to say answer the
question
how how was it right recently
okay number whoa what's wrong with this
lady
she looks very strange well she has many
arms
right well what this picture is showing
is that she has many things to do
she's very very busy isn't she to be
busy doing
something so unfortunately she doesn't
have
six arms right maybe she wishes she had
six
arms but she's very busy she's doing
many things
so she is very active
active if somebody is active that means
that they're busy
or that they are doing something by the
way what's the opposite
of active you could say passive
when we talk about people people are
active
or sometimes people are passive that
means sit back
sometimes you were passive right oh you
had a long day at school
you go home oh i just want to rest want
to watch
tv you are being passive we use
active and passive for people but we
also use active for volcanoes
if a volcano is active that means
it can erupt soon but we don't say we
don't really use
passive for volcanoes if a volcano is
dead
and it will not erupt then we say it's
dormant
dormant so dormant is used for volcano
a volcano is dormant it's a little
strange to say a volcano is passive
people are passive volcanoes are dormant
okay let's move on number eight
sleeping now this is our word here
dormant that i just taught you right
we say people are passive but we say
volcanoes
are dormant and it says sleeping here so
you know volcanoes aren't really awake
right
they're not really sleeping they're
either active
or they're dormant okay of course in
this picture
this volcano has been dormant it looks
like it's
been dormant for a long time it has snow
on it or maybe it's just winter right
and there's a lot of snow there
but this volcano is not active it's not
erupting so it's dormant sometimes
people can say that volcano is sleeping
but that's kind of a poetic
way to describe it it's kind of like oh
the mountains are sleeping
the forest is sleeping but usually the
technical or scientific
word is dormant okay next one
hot melted rock found inside the earth
we saw this picture before
when you see this picture do you
remember the word we just learned
a little a few seconds ago lava
well this is different this word is
magma so magma is hot melted rock
found inside the earth and you're
probably thinking right now
what's the difference between lava and
magma
it's a good question right the the
difference
is location location
in other words where is it
this one says found inside the
earth if it's underground if it's deep
inside the earth
we say it's magma but when the magma
comes to the surface when it comes out
of the volcano
now it's in a different location it's on
the surface
and then it is lava
okay so maybe let me do this differently
a surface
if it's on the surface it is
lava but if it is inside the earth
it is magma so it all depends
on the location where is it on the
surface
lava inside the earth magma
so we have different words for depending
on whether
it whether where it is on where it is
okay
number 10 wow where is that that's not
on earth that's on the moon
right the outside of an object but when
we talk about the moon
of course the astronauts didn't go in
the moon
right they walked where they walked on
the
surface on the surface
on the surface of
the moon right on the surface
of the moon on the surface of the earth
we don't live in earth right we live
on the earth right we live on the
surface
of the earth okay so the outside of an
object is
the surface okay
next one a mountain with a hole in the
top
a mountain with a hole in the top we've
already talked about this word
i've used it several times already of
course we're talking about
a volcano volcano we don't really
pronounce the
l you don't say volcano you say
volcano volcano okay
so of course we're talking about this
it's a mountain
there's a hole in the top and smoke
ash and lava come out of the volcano
erupt okay number 12.
if you're looking at a map let's say
you're here and you want to go there
well that's not far away it's not far
right
if it's far it's omurawal right buddhawa
but it's kakawayo right not far away
we say nearby nearby
nearby or you could also say close
it's close it's nearby
it is close it is nearby
where is the post office oh don't worry
it's nearby
it's close it's not far away
right okay next one
a scientist do you want to be a
scientist like this this looks like
an exciting job looking and studying the
heavens
this is a scientist who studies outer
space
of course there are many many scientists
scientists study different things some
scientists study life
they're biologists some scientists study
the earth
their geologists but this is a scientist
who studies outer space
right out the moon the planets the stars
what do we call that scientist we call
that scientist
an astronomer that's a big word right
astronomer astronomer
astronomer so we say astronomer
is a scientist who studies outer space
okay number 14
this is a fun thing to do in the
summertime maybe you go
to kwanghwa moon in seoul or city hall
and they have a fountain coming from the
sidewalk right
and that's very fun to play in in the
summer time
well a stream of water going into the
air i just said it
it's a fountain fountain
fountain okay two sounds found ten
a fountain and many kids like to play in
the fountain
during the summer okay so the next word
here we have a picture
of of a very hot liquid
and it's something that wasn't liquid
before to become
liquid by heating now before we've
talked about
rock rock being so hot it turns into a
liquid
that's really amazing isn't it but if
you think about it
everything on the earth all the material
you can think of
if you heat it up at a high temperature
it turns from a solid into
a liquid it goes from solid to
liquid now what word do we use
to describe this action we say
melt to melt lt at the end
alt melt melt so if something
melts it turns from a solid to a liquid
it becomes liquid by a lot of heat
we can see melting every day if it's a
hot summer day
and you have ice cubes in your water
those
ice cubes will melt so ice melts
very easily ice cream melts easily you
have to eat it quickly right
now don't eat it too quickly right but
ice cream will melt
sometimes people like the melted ice
cream that's also good
okay this is our last word and look at
the picture
whoa it makes you really sleepy right
it's like pyeonghan right very peaceful
there's nobody no people in the picture
all we can see is just like an empty
dock
the boat is empty nobody's there the sea
is very calm everything
is very peaceful and what
quiet without much noise or activity
so imagine if you're there you don't
hear much noise maybe a little bit of
noise from the water
but it's soothing it's peaceful there's
no
activity nobody's running around or
making noise
the waves are very calm it's very quiet
very quiet scene
very peaceful okay it's time to begin
the exercises for the vocabulary
in this exercise it says exercise two
we're skipping exercise one
right to exercise two we're using a
paragraph
so we're looking at a paragraph and we
need to complete the paragraph
there are blanks in the paragraph we
need to choose the right word
to put in the blank to finish the
paragraph
okay so what are our words we have five
words here first one is gush
gush next erupt
erupt next one active
active the next one dormant
dormant and the final one
liquid liquid those are our five
words we have to choose which word is
the best
to put into these blanks let's take a
look the first sentence have you
ever seen a volcano
then we have a blank we're looking
probably for a verb here
because have you ever seen a volcano do
something
well what do volcanoes do right we
talked about that
which well first of all if we look at
our words only two of them
are verbs right and the two verbs are
gush
and erupt does a volcano gush or does it
erupt remember before we talked about a
volcano erupts
okay so a volcano or
uh something that's a geological uh
formation like a volcano erupts
that erupts it doesn't gush right that's
a different meaning we'll see that next
actually
so have you ever seen a volcano erupt
it's an amazing thing to see this is all
connected it's all one paragraph
so have you ever seen it have you ever
seen a volcano erupt
maybe you've seen one erupt on
television or in the movies
i don't think you've seen one erupt in
real life that's kind of rare
thank goodness but anyway you've
probably seen
any volcano erupt on the television or
in the movies
it's amazing if you do see a volcano
erupt in real life
wow it's really incredible but of course
be careful
right pay attention to what the police
and people tell you
about active volcanoes anyway it's an
amazing thing to see
i like watching the lava beep out from
the top
so the lava what does the lava do right
we have two verbs here right i said we
have two verbs gush
and erupt are both verbs we used erupt
we need another verb here it's going to
be gush
right now that's interesting think about
this for a minute
volcanoes don't gush they erupt
lava doesn't erupt it gushes
what's the difference what's going on a
volcano is the thing
right it's the geological feature it
explodes
it erupts okay it doesn't gush
what what the the substance that comes
out of it
that's what gushes okay
so the lava gushes or before on the
slide we saw before
at the very beginning we saw water
coming out of the ground
the water was coming out of a geyser
a geyser is similar in this sense to a
volcano
of course a geyser is in a big mountain
it's a hole in the ground where water
comes out of the geyser
erupts water gushes
so you see the thing whether it's a
volcano or a geyser
that's the geological thing object
it erupts the substance that comes out
that gushes so that's a good difference
that's a good thing to remember
okay the lava looks like beep
fire what kind of fire is it
active dormant or liquid fire remember
when we saw the video
it looked like the rock looked like a
what liquid it looked like a liquid
so the lava looks like liquid fire
it's like a liquid that is on fire and
actually it's very dangerous it is a
liquid and if you touch it
your skin will become on fire so don't
touch lava
don't get near lava okay so those are
our words
have you ever seen a volcano erupt it's
an amazing thing to see
i like watching the lava gush out
from the top the lava looks like liquid
fire continuing on the slide but i've
only
seen lava once that's because
most volcanoes aren't are not
what okay so think about this i said
it's
rare to see a volcano erupt because
most volcanoes are not what if a volcano
is erupting
is it is it active or is it passive
most volcanoes are not active
and that's a good thing right we don't
want most volcanoes to be active
because that would be dangerous for the
people around the volcano
most volcanoes aren't active most of
them are what
what's the opposite pandero of active
the opposite of active is dormant
dormant so most volcanoes are not active
they don't erupt they're dormant they
are like
sleeping they don't have any action they
are
quiet okay well that wraps up the
vocabulary
exercises let's take a short break and
we'll come back and do the reading
you

00:23
lesson title
00:24
is fire under the earth do you know
00:27
there's a fire under the earth we're
00:30
going to talk about that
00:31
in this lesson so we will focus on
00:34
let's learn about a volcano
00:38
do you know what a volcano is well we
00:40
have a video here
00:42
of what a volcano looks like i'm sure
00:45
you've seen them on television right
00:47
here we have a mountain as you can see
00:50
and look at this
00:51
there's fire coming out of the mountain
00:54
let's look at the video
00:55
okay wow look at that all of this fire
00:58
is coming out
00:59
from the top of the mountain where is it
01:02
coming from
01:03
well it's coming from deep below the
01:06
surface of the earth
01:07
and that's what our lesson is about
01:10
today
01:10
now before we get into uh too much into
01:13
the lesson of course
01:14
we have to review some important
01:16
vocabulary words
01:17
so let's begin with the first one
01:21
the first one we have a picture here
01:23
this looks like
01:24
yellowstone national park which is a
01:27
park
01:28
a very famous park in america where
01:31
hot water comes out of the ground it
01:34
comes out
01:35
very suddenly and in great volume
01:38
it suddenly comes up shoots up into the
01:42
sky
01:42
now there is a very specific verb
01:46
we can use to describe exactly
01:49
that action what is that verb that verb
01:52
is
01:53
gush to gush so we use to gush
01:57
to explain when something suddenly
02:00
and in a lot of volume comes out
02:04
not just of the earth you know sometimes
02:07
people gush too do you have a friend
02:11
who talks very fast and very quickly and
02:13
they say a whole lot of stuff
02:15
they are gushing so you can say my
02:17
friend
02:18
gushes right that means that they're
02:21
talking very quickly
02:23
and they are saying many things very
02:26
suddenly
02:27
so many things gush right
02:30
of course in this lesson we're going to
02:32
be talking about things that gush
02:34
from up under the earth okay let's move
02:38
on to the next word
02:40
here we have some three pictures or a
02:42
picture of three objects right
02:44
and it says water or oil but really to
02:47
be
02:48
honest it's not just water or
02:51
oil it's any substance that
02:54
doesn't have a shape that you can pour
02:58
into a container you can pour out of a
03:00
container
03:01
if you pour it out it flows over the
03:04
ground
03:05
or it goes into the ground what type of
03:09
substance is that we say that that is
03:12
liquid liquid right liquid
03:16
it's liquid water is liquid oil is
03:19
liquid
03:20
that video that we saw of the volcano
03:23
that's actually liquid rock
03:27
isn't that amazing rock can be liquid
03:30
we'll talk about that some more later
03:32
okay the next one
03:34
wow this looks very very very
03:37
old doesn't it when we look at something
03:40
like this
03:40
these are ruins right ruins
03:44
from a very very old civilization
03:47
you've probably read about rome or a
03:51
long
03:51
long time ago in china or even in korea
03:55
we can see ruins they're very old
03:59
another word for very old it's an
04:01
adjective that we use
04:03
it's ancient ancient
04:07
it's a little bit maybe a difficult word
04:09
so ain't
04:10
chint ancient ancient
04:14
these are ancient ruins okay let's move
04:17
on
04:18
wow very neat picture that's really cool
04:21
looking isn't it very beautiful right
04:24
here of course we can see another
04:26
volcano this is another volcano here
04:28
and actually we can see many volcanoes
04:31
right
04:32
to throw out violently if something is
04:35
being
04:35
thrown out violently what do we say we
04:39
say
04:39
it's erupting to erupt when a volcano
04:43
begins to throw out the very
04:47
hot rock and smoke and
04:50
ash and also ash ashes you know when you
04:54
have a fire
04:55
and the smoke goes out sometimes pieces
04:58
of the
04:59
of the smoke fall from the sky onto your
05:01
arm right
05:02
that's ash it's actually pieces of the
05:04
wood that fly up in the air
05:06
and come down on your arm so ash all of
05:09
this stuff
05:10
smoke ash molten rock is
05:13
thrown out of the volcano when the
05:16
volcano
05:17
erupts okay next word
05:22
now we're talking a lot right i keep
05:24
talking about the hot melted rock
05:26
but there's a better word for it right
05:28
there's a better word for it
05:30
the hot melted rock that comes out of a
05:32
volcano
05:33
we have a specific word for it what is
05:36
it
05:36
it's called lava right before i taught
05:40
you
05:40
ash that's one of the things that comes
05:43
out of a volcano
05:44
the other one is smoke and finally we
05:46
have
05:47
lava lava is very dangerous isn't it
05:52
it's uh it's also difficult to pronounce
05:54
lava
05:56
lava okay it's hot melted rock
05:59
imagine rock that is
06:03
so hot it's red and it's
06:06
liquid don't go near that it's really
06:10
dangerous right
06:11
so you should not be close to a volcano
06:14
when it erupts right because if the lava
06:18
touches you
06:19
that's really dangerous so you don't
06:21
want to be close
06:23
to the lava okay
06:26
here's a cute picture what's going on
06:29
with this kitten right
06:30
it's a kitten a baby cat a kitten so it
06:34
was
06:34
born not long ago
06:37
another word for not long ago we can say
06:41
recently recently so when we add
06:45
l-y it's an adverb it describes you know
06:49
when it happened recently
06:50
recent well how recent it was recently
06:53
okay
06:54
so recently means it was not long
06:57
ago recently a little bit difficult
07:00
pronunciation
07:01
re sent lee recently
07:05
recently remember recent is just an
07:08
adjective
07:09
recently add l y to say answer the
07:12
question
07:12
how how was it right recently
07:16
okay number whoa what's wrong with this
07:19
lady
07:20
she looks very strange well she has many
07:23
arms
07:23
right well what this picture is showing
07:25
is that she has many things to do
07:28
she's very very busy isn't she to be
07:32
busy doing
07:32
something so unfortunately she doesn't
07:36
have
07:36
six arms right maybe she wishes she had
07:40
six
07:40
arms but she's very busy she's doing
07:42
many things
07:43
so she is very active
07:47
active if somebody is active that means
07:50
that they're busy
07:51
or that they are doing something by the
07:54
way what's the opposite
07:56
of active you could say passive
08:02
when we talk about people people are
08:05
active
08:05
or sometimes people are passive that
08:08
means sit back
08:09
sometimes you were passive right oh you
08:12
had a long day at school
08:14
you go home oh i just want to rest want
08:16
to watch
08:17
tv you are being passive we use
08:20
active and passive for people but we
08:23
also use active for volcanoes
08:27
if a volcano is active that means
08:31
it can erupt soon but we don't say we
08:35
don't really use
08:36
passive for volcanoes if a volcano is
08:39
dead
08:40
and it will not erupt then we say it's
08:42
dormant
08:46
dormant so dormant is used for volcano
08:52
a volcano is dormant it's a little
08:54
strange to say a volcano is passive
08:57
people are passive volcanoes are dormant
09:00
okay let's move on number eight
09:04
sleeping now this is our word here
09:07
dormant that i just taught you right
09:09
we say people are passive but we say
09:11
volcanoes
09:13
are dormant and it says sleeping here so
09:17
you know volcanoes aren't really awake
09:20
right
09:20
they're not really sleeping they're
09:22
either active
09:23
or they're dormant okay of course in
09:25
this picture
09:26
this volcano has been dormant it looks
09:29
like it's
09:30
been dormant for a long time it has snow
09:33
on it or maybe it's just winter right
09:35
and there's a lot of snow there
09:36
but this volcano is not active it's not
09:40
erupting so it's dormant sometimes
09:43
people can say that volcano is sleeping
09:45
but that's kind of a poetic
09:47
way to describe it it's kind of like oh
09:49
the mountains are sleeping
09:51
the forest is sleeping but usually the
09:53
technical or scientific
09:55
word is dormant okay next one
10:00
hot melted rock found inside the earth
10:03
we saw this picture before
10:05
when you see this picture do you
10:06
remember the word we just learned
10:09
a little a few seconds ago lava
10:12
well this is different this word is
10:15
magma so magma is hot melted rock
10:19
found inside the earth and you're
10:21
probably thinking right now
10:23
what's the difference between lava and
10:26
magma
10:27
it's a good question right the the
10:29
difference
10:30
is location location
10:34
in other words where is it
10:37
this one says found inside the
10:41
earth if it's underground if it's deep
10:44
inside the earth
10:45
we say it's magma but when the magma
10:49
comes to the surface when it comes out
10:52
of the volcano
10:53
now it's in a different location it's on
10:55
the surface
10:57
and then it is lava
11:01
okay so maybe let me do this differently
11:03
a surface
11:04
if it's on the surface it is
11:08
lava but if it is inside the earth
11:12
it is magma so it all depends
11:15
on the location where is it on the
11:18
surface
11:19
lava inside the earth magma
11:22
so we have different words for depending
11:25
on whether
11:26
it whether where it is on where it is
11:28
okay
11:29
number 10 wow where is that that's not
11:32
on earth that's on the moon
11:34
right the outside of an object but when
11:37
we talk about the moon
11:38
of course the astronauts didn't go in
11:41
the moon
11:42
right they walked where they walked on
11:44
the
11:45
surface on the surface
11:48
on the surface of
11:51
the moon right on the surface
11:54
of the moon on the surface of the earth
11:58
we don't live in earth right we live
12:01
on the earth right we live on the
12:04
surface
12:05
of the earth okay so the outside of an
12:08
object is
12:09
the surface okay
12:12
next one a mountain with a hole in the
12:15
top
12:15
a mountain with a hole in the top we've
12:17
already talked about this word
12:19
i've used it several times already of
12:22
course we're talking about
12:24
a volcano volcano we don't really
12:27
pronounce the
12:28
l you don't say volcano you say
12:32
volcano volcano okay
12:35
so of course we're talking about this
12:37
it's a mountain
12:38
there's a hole in the top and smoke
12:42
ash and lava come out of the volcano
12:46
erupt okay number 12.
12:49
if you're looking at a map let's say
12:51
you're here and you want to go there
12:54
well that's not far away it's not far
12:57
right
12:58
if it's far it's omurawal right buddhawa
13:01
but it's kakawayo right not far away
13:05
we say nearby nearby
13:08
nearby or you could also say close
13:12
it's close it's nearby
13:17
it is close it is nearby
13:21
where is the post office oh don't worry
13:23
it's nearby
13:25
it's close it's not far away
13:28
right okay next one
13:31
a scientist do you want to be a
13:33
scientist like this this looks like
13:35
an exciting job looking and studying the
13:38
heavens
13:40
this is a scientist who studies outer
13:42
space
13:43
of course there are many many scientists
13:47
scientists study different things some
13:50
scientists study life
13:52
they're biologists some scientists study
13:55
the earth
13:56
their geologists but this is a scientist
14:00
who studies outer space
14:03
right out the moon the planets the stars
14:06
what do we call that scientist we call
14:09
that scientist
14:10
an astronomer that's a big word right
14:14
astronomer astronomer
14:18
astronomer so we say astronomer
14:22
is a scientist who studies outer space
14:25
okay number 14
14:29
this is a fun thing to do in the
14:30
summertime maybe you go
14:32
to kwanghwa moon in seoul or city hall
14:36
and they have a fountain coming from the
14:39
sidewalk right
14:40
and that's very fun to play in in the
14:43
summer time
14:44
well a stream of water going into the
14:46
air i just said it
14:48
it's a fountain fountain
14:51
fountain okay two sounds found ten
14:54
a fountain and many kids like to play in
14:57
the fountain
14:58
during the summer okay so the next word
15:01
here we have a picture
15:02
of of a very hot liquid
15:06
and it's something that wasn't liquid
15:08
before to become
15:09
liquid by heating now before we've
15:12
talked about
15:13
rock rock being so hot it turns into a
15:17
liquid
15:18
that's really amazing isn't it but if
15:20
you think about it
15:21
everything on the earth all the material
15:24
you can think of
15:26
if you heat it up at a high temperature
15:30
it turns from a solid into
15:34
a liquid it goes from solid to
15:37
liquid now what word do we use
15:40
to describe this action we say
15:44
melt to melt lt at the end
15:48
alt melt melt so if something
15:52
melts it turns from a solid to a liquid
15:55
it becomes liquid by a lot of heat
15:59
we can see melting every day if it's a
16:02
hot summer day
16:03
and you have ice cubes in your water
16:06
those
16:06
ice cubes will melt so ice melts
16:10
very easily ice cream melts easily you
16:13
have to eat it quickly right
16:15
now don't eat it too quickly right but
16:17
ice cream will melt
16:18
sometimes people like the melted ice
16:21
cream that's also good
16:22
okay this is our last word and look at
16:25
the picture
16:26
whoa it makes you really sleepy right
16:29
it's like pyeonghan right very peaceful
16:33
there's nobody no people in the picture
16:37
all we can see is just like an empty
16:39
dock
16:40
the boat is empty nobody's there the sea
16:43
is very calm everything
16:46
is very peaceful and what
16:50
quiet without much noise or activity
16:55
so imagine if you're there you don't
16:57
hear much noise maybe a little bit of
16:58
noise from the water
17:00
but it's soothing it's peaceful there's
17:02
no
17:03
activity nobody's running around or
17:06
making noise
17:07
the waves are very calm it's very quiet
17:10
very quiet scene
17:11
very peaceful okay it's time to begin
17:14
the exercises for the vocabulary
17:16
in this exercise it says exercise two
17:19
we're skipping exercise one
17:21
right to exercise two we're using a
17:23
paragraph
17:24
so we're looking at a paragraph and we
17:27
need to complete the paragraph
17:29
there are blanks in the paragraph we
17:32
need to choose the right word
17:34
to put in the blank to finish the
17:37
paragraph
17:38
okay so what are our words we have five
17:41
words here first one is gush
17:45
gush next erupt
17:49
erupt next one active
17:53
active the next one dormant
17:58
dormant and the final one
18:01
liquid liquid those are our five
18:05
words we have to choose which word is
18:08
the best
18:09
to put into these blanks let's take a
18:12
look the first sentence have you
18:14
ever seen a volcano
18:17
then we have a blank we're looking
18:20
probably for a verb here
18:22
because have you ever seen a volcano do
18:25
something
18:26
well what do volcanoes do right we
18:28
talked about that
18:30
which well first of all if we look at
18:32
our words only two of them
18:34
are verbs right and the two verbs are
18:37
gush
18:37
and erupt does a volcano gush or does it
18:40
erupt remember before we talked about a
18:43
volcano erupts
18:45
okay so a volcano or
18:48
uh something that's a geological uh
18:52
formation like a volcano erupts
18:56
that erupts it doesn't gush right that's
18:59
a different meaning we'll see that next
19:01
actually
19:02
so have you ever seen a volcano erupt
19:04
it's an amazing thing to see this is all
19:07
connected it's all one paragraph
19:08
so have you ever seen it have you ever
19:11
seen a volcano erupt
19:12
maybe you've seen one erupt on
19:14
television or in the movies
19:16
i don't think you've seen one erupt in
19:18
real life that's kind of rare
19:20
thank goodness but anyway you've
19:22
probably seen
19:23
any volcano erupt on the television or
19:25
in the movies
19:26
it's amazing if you do see a volcano
19:29
erupt in real life
19:30
wow it's really incredible but of course
19:33
be careful
19:34
right pay attention to what the police
19:36
and people tell you
19:38
about active volcanoes anyway it's an
19:40
amazing thing to see
19:41
i like watching the lava beep out from
19:45
the top
19:46
so the lava what does the lava do right
19:49
we have two verbs here right i said we
19:51
have two verbs gush
19:52
and erupt are both verbs we used erupt
19:55
we need another verb here it's going to
19:57
be gush
19:59
right now that's interesting think about
20:01
this for a minute
20:02
volcanoes don't gush they erupt
20:05
lava doesn't erupt it gushes
20:09
what's the difference what's going on a
20:11
volcano is the thing
20:13
right it's the geological feature it
20:15
explodes
20:16
it erupts okay it doesn't gush
20:20
what what the the substance that comes
20:22
out of it
20:23
that's what gushes okay
20:26
so the lava gushes or before on the
20:28
slide we saw before
20:30
at the very beginning we saw water
20:32
coming out of the ground
20:34
the water was coming out of a geyser
20:38
a geyser is similar in this sense to a
20:42
volcano
20:43
of course a geyser is in a big mountain
20:45
it's a hole in the ground where water
20:46
comes out of the geyser
20:48
erupts water gushes
20:51
so you see the thing whether it's a
20:54
volcano or a geyser
20:55
that's the geological thing object
20:59
it erupts the substance that comes out
21:03
that gushes so that's a good difference
21:06
that's a good thing to remember
21:08
okay the lava looks like beep
21:11
fire what kind of fire is it
21:15
active dormant or liquid fire remember
21:18
when we saw the video
21:19
it looked like the rock looked like a
21:22
what liquid it looked like a liquid
21:25
so the lava looks like liquid fire
21:28
it's like a liquid that is on fire and
21:32
actually it's very dangerous it is a
21:34
liquid and if you touch it
21:36
your skin will become on fire so don't
21:38
touch lava
21:39
don't get near lava okay so those are
21:42
our words
21:43
have you ever seen a volcano erupt it's
21:46
an amazing thing to see
21:48
i like watching the lava gush out
21:51
from the top the lava looks like liquid
21:55
fire continuing on the slide but i've
21:58
only
21:58
seen lava once that's because
22:02
most volcanoes aren't are not
22:05
what okay so think about this i said
22:09
it's
22:09
rare to see a volcano erupt because
22:13
most volcanoes are not what if a volcano
22:17
is erupting
22:18
is it is it active or is it passive
22:22
most volcanoes are not active
22:25
and that's a good thing right we don't
22:28
want most volcanoes to be active
22:30
because that would be dangerous for the
22:32
people around the volcano
22:34
most volcanoes aren't active most of
22:37
them are what
22:38
what's the opposite pandero of active
22:41
the opposite of active is dormant
22:45
dormant so most volcanoes are not active
22:48
they don't erupt they're dormant they
22:51
are like
22:52
sleeping they don't have any action they
22:55
are
22:56
quiet okay well that wraps up the
22:58
vocabulary
23:00
exercises let's take a short break and
23:02
we'll come back and do the reading
23:10
you
