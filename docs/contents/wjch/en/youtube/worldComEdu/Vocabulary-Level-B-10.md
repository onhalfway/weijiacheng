i'm brian stewart
are you ready to start learning about
bones that's what we're talking about
right we're talking about the human body
lesson 10 is talking about bones
so in this lesson we will focus on
learning about the function
of bones in our body what are bones do
you know what bones are
whoa very scary right this is a picture
of a person's bones right of somebody
who
you know who's dead right
but the only thing that is left are the
bones right
and of course the skull right this is a
skull s-k-u-l-l
that's a bone right there right one big
bone and then there's
other bones that are connected right
there's all different bones
so your head bones connected to your
back bone connected to your leg bone
right
we've got all different bones in
different parts
of our body by the way do you know what
the entire
collection of bones are called
not just for humans but for animals too
if you look at all the bones connected
if all the bones are connected we call
that a
skeleton a skeleton
is all the bones in an animal's body
that are all connected and in the right
place
it's a complete skeleton sometimes if
bones are missing
we say it's part of a skeleton
but the whole collection of bones is the
skeleton
the skeleton okay let's move on with our
words
okay now here we have our first word and
the clue
is not curved or the definition is not
curved
think about if you're in a car or you're
on a bus
and you're going along a road and the
road is not
curved you are going in one direction
you
keep going in the same direction for a
long ways
in that case we can say the road is
straight the road is straight and many
people when they give directions they'll
say
go straight ahead don't turn go
straight do not curve go straight
so straight s t r
stra straw eight
like eight i ate something eight
straight
straight okay a little bit difficult but
you think about it str straw and think
eight
right i ate breakfast this morning
straight
straight it's one syllable one uh
long one uh grouping of a sound
straight straight okay next number two
interesting picture what what is this
thing in here
we're looking inside a person's body
these are the
organs inside a person's body the organs
and you have many different organs you
have lungs
you have kidneys you have
bladder you also have where the food
we eat goes and that's the red part here
what is that part what organ is that in
our body
that is the stomach sta
mech stomach so we say stomach
stomach is your stomach full stop eating
if your stomach is empty then it's time
to eat
stomach okay number three
this boy is having fun but he
is keeping safe how because he has a
helmet
on right of course he should probably
wear
pads on his elbows and his knees but
be careful wear a helmet keep
safe what is he doing he is protecting
his body so when you're playing protect
yourself
right if you're going to go
rollerblading
wear a helmet if you're riding a bike
wear a helmet maybe you should wear
elbow pads
elbow pads
elbow pads and knee pads
these also help protect your body
in case of an accident or in case you
fall down
so protect yourself keep safe
next one okay what's going on here do
you do this
do you make your body strong an activity
to train
your body what is it it of course is
called
exercise exercise
exercise so very quickly
exercise exercise
do you exercise i hope you get enough
exercise to make your body strong
next one oh we have some money here
right
to take and hold in your hand but it's
not about the money
it's about the action of taking
something
and holding it in your hand now if you
do it quickly
if you do it quickly we say grab
okay so it's not just to take and hold
in your hand
but it also means to do that quickly if
your brother younger brother or sister
sees your candy they might grab a piece
of your candy right
that's very quick right so you might
grab
something very quickly you take it and
hold it in your
hand but it usually means to quickly
grab
something right grab it quickly before
it's gone
okay grab grab
number six oh so cute right
oh what covers your body now of course
this
baby doesn't have any clothes on
but there's still something covering his
body or her body we're not sure but what
is
this and we all have it right it's
covering our body it protects
the inside of our body what do we call
it we call it
skin right and newborn baby their skin
is very
soft right soft as a newborn
baby it's skin skin
covers our body from head to toe
okay next one seven to stretch out
and try to touch something so you see
this little boy here
he's not so tall he's stretching
and he's trying to do what what is he
trying to do
he's trying to reach the flowers
of the tree to reach something so if you
extend
your arm now it can be you can reach up
you can reach
across you can reach down there's many
ways that you can reach
right it just means to stretch out just
if you're stretching your arm that's
reaching right uh if you stretch out
your
your leg maybe you're trying to touch
something you're trying to reach
something with your foot okay so it just
means to use a part of your body
to to try to touch something that is not
close to you
to reach and it can be any different
direction okay okay eight
this is an exciting road right before we
saw the the road that was straight
oh that's shimsham hail right that's
very boring but this wow this is
exciting right
we can and it's also very uh usually
more
scenic prettier more beautiful
having round shape having a round shape
also this sign you can see it's kind of
like a round
half of a circle we say it's curved
so if the road changes direction
many times it's a curved road or even if
it just changes one
direction it's curved now this might be
a little hard to pronounce
curved remember the v sound right in the
middle
and you make a little vibration with
your throat
so curved curved
and then you stop it with the d sound
curved
curved so curved okay
next one is nine to go from one place
to another so what are these people
doing they're putting their stuff in
boxes
they're going from one place to another
they're
moving right isa isa right
you're moving from one place to another
so you call
two four two four for the company that
will help you
move from one place to another i think
you say isa isa in korea right
okay so to move especially when people
move their house they move their home
let's move
we live in seoul let's move to busan
or let's move to taejon so you move from
one place to another
or you move from gangnam and you go up
to chungno
all right you change the place where you
live
ten oh that's cute too right what's
going on there
uh looks like the mother is touching her
baby's
feet right and the lots of skin here
okay to put your hand on something
to put your hand on something means to
touch right
the mother is touching her baby's feet
if you put your hand on something
doesn't matter what it is
i put my hand on the pen i'm touching it
i put my hand on my head
i'm touching my head okay put your hand
on the tv
you're touching the tv to touch
something
eleven a hard white thing in your body
this by the way is called an x-ray
doctors in hospitals will use x-rays
to make sure your bones are okay oh i
just said the word right to make sure
there's no
broken what no broken bones
bone is that a hard word to pronounce
bone ba bone it's very easy
bone okay a hard white thing in your
body
you have many bones this is your hand
right
look at how many bones are in your hand
there are so
many bones in just your hand if you
think about it
okay 12 the part of the body
between the shoulder and the hand so
we're looking at the part of the body
here's your shoulder here
oops here's your shoulder here and
there's your hand down here
so we're looking at this part of the
body right here
and as you can see there's two parts
right what do we call it
we call it the arm the arm now of course
you have an
upper arm and a lower arm so we can say
this
is upper upper arm
well you could say this is the lower arm
lower
but some people will also call it the
forearm forearm yeah that's an e not a c
f o r e okay
well let's do it easier for you guys
forearm so forearm is here we could also
call the lower arm
this is upper arm so if you're if you're
complaining ah my
my arm hurts where does it hurt my upper
arm hurts
or my forearm hurts right so you have
two parts
to your arm okay and of course those two
parts are separated by what's this
just kunyang ago right it's called the
elbow elbow the elbow is right here and
that
separates the two parts of your arm
arm is arm hard to pronounce arm
arm pretty easy okay next one
here we have a skeleton again right this
is our skeleton right the bone
that surrounds the chest it should be
really
the bones that surround the chest not
the bone
the bones that surround because as you
can see there are many of them
right there's so many of them what do we
call them
we call these ribs now you probably know
rib is kalbi
okay but of course you don't eat a human
rib
oh that's horrible right you eat duiji
kaldi
or do you eat beef calbees i don't know
how do you say that how do you say that
bulgogi called me you don't say that
but uh uh duiji kalbi those would be
ribs like
short ribs okay la caldi right okay
so that's very delicious right but
of course you look at this picture
that's not delicious but anyway these
are the ribs
now if you want to talk about the whole
thing right if you talk about
all the ribs together what does it look
like
it kind of looks like a cage doesn't it
a cage where you keep
an animal or something in so we call the
whole thing
a rib cage
rib cage is the whole thing right it's
like a cage
that protects the inside of your body
right
we call it a rib cage and it's made up
by the individual there are many ribs
okay
so rib are ra
rib rib okay we got the eye between the
er
and the ba rib so these are called ribs
the bones that surround the chest ribs
okay near near this is very near
the hole right we could also say it's
close so near
and close mean the same thing they mean
the same
thing okay something to keep an
animal in we already talked about that
right i
just talked about with your ribs it
looks if you talk about the whole thing
it's like a cage right so rib
rib cage but in this case this is just a
cage this isn't a rib cage
this is just a cage you keep birds
in a cage something to keep an animal
in is a cage
16 the part of the body we use
for walking what part of our bodies
do we use for walking do we use our head
for walking
no that that hurts right do we use our
arms for walking
no we don't use our arms for walking we
use
our legs for walking the leg is used for
walking
for running for kicking the ball we use
our
legs for many things okay but especially
we use our legs to walk okay let's go
over the uh
vocabulary exercises we have a little
bit of
different exercises this time in the
first part
we're going to find words that mean the
same thing
find the word in the box that means the
same
or almost the same maybe not exactly the
same
but similar pistandeo maybe not
dokka tayo but pistandeo right same
is dokitel similar pistandeo right
so the same or almost the same
as the underlined word or words so we
see the sentence here we see this
is underlined this is underlined which
word is similar or the same
as these underlined parts of the
sentence
our words are first exercise
exercise next is curved
curved and next one is
reach reach okay
number one john likes to ride bicycles
and play soccer so we have two parts
of the sentence two parts
that are underlined so what is
riding bicycles and playing soccer
what are those things what word is
similar to those activities
if you guessed exercise you are correct
exercise john likes to ride bicycles and
play soccer
those are types of exercise
if you think about exercise exercise is
the big word
right and inside that word under the
umbrella or circle of exercise
many types of exercise riding bikes
playing soccer jumping rope
running or jogging playing tennis
rollerblading those are all types of
exercise two
our rib bones are shaped like
c like c like what
like a c in other words our rib bones if
you look at the rib bone
if you look at a c the letter c is like
this
so it's not a straight shape right what
is it
it's a curved shape our rib bones are
shaped like a c or like like the letter
c okay that's what it's talking about
it's not a mistake in typing
it's just what they're saying is what
letter does it look like
it looks like a c okay so
they are curved a c is curved
if you said look like an l a small
l that's straight right that would be
pandero of curved
okay next one three i'm too short
okay i'm too short i can't touch the
ceiling
so if you are you know short and you're
you're doing this with your arm you're
stretching your arm out you're trying to
touch the ceiling
what are you doing you are reaching i
can't
reach the ceiling same word that would
be exactly the same not similar
the same i can't touch the ceiling i
can't reach
the ceiling i can't touch
the television i can't reach the
television okay
same thing okay so the this exercise is
finding
words that are the same or almost the
same
the next exercise is finding the words
that have
opposite meaning pandero right circle
the word or words
in the sentence that are opposite
of the word in bold print what is
bold print that's the heavy dark
print that you see there when a word is
darker and bigger
than normal we say it's bold bold print
that's this one here and this one so
uh let's circle the word or words that
are
opposite pandero of this one our word
here is
grab number one is grab so our sentence
is
poor mike his balloon is gone
he let it go out of his hand
so remember grab is to take and hold
in your hand right grab is to take and
hold in your hand
what's the opposite the opposite is here
he let it go if you let
something go that's the opposite of grab
grab is to take in your hand let it go
is to let it leave your hand and think
about
he had a balloon a balloon wants to go
up
but you hold on to it if you let go of
the string
the balloon goes away okay so let it go
grab opposite number two is protect
that's our word here
protect the rock is going to hurt the
boy
he should wear a helmet okay so protect
means to keep yourself safe
from danger so that you don't get
hurt right so protect the opposite of
course
is to hurt the opposite of protect
is to hurt something okay he should wear
a helmet
so that he doesn't get hurt so that he
protects himself
so protect and hurt are opposites
okay the third one the word is straight
straight what is the opposite of
straight
in the sentence or two sentences it is
raining
so drive slowly right it is raining
the road gets mikroah mikro yeah microwa
slippery it's dangerous also
this road is curved so be careful
there's two things you have to watch out
for one there's rain so it's mikroa
mikripta mikuro mikroyal that's
slippery the second thing is the road is
curved right so be careful now
it's curved is the opposite of straight
right
straight means doesn't change direction
keeps going the same direction
but curved means that it changes
direction and if you're driving
joshua right you have to be careful
especially
if it's wet because it's slippery you
could
have a problem okay well that wraps up
the vocabulary section of this lesson

road is not
02:13
curved you are going in one direction
02:16

keep going in the same direction for a
02:19
long ways
02:20
in that case we can say the road is
02:24
straight the road is straight and many
02:28
people when they give directions they'll
02:30
say
02:30

so if the road changes direction
08:22
many times it's a curved road or even if
08:25
it just changes one
08:27
direction it's curved now this might be
08:30
a little hard to pronounce
08:32

middle
08:37
and you make a little vibration with

08:46
curved
08:48
curved so curved okay
08:52

it's a curved shape our rib bones are
18:00
shaped like a c or like like the letter
18:04
c okay that's what it's talking about

19:04
words that are the same or almost the
19:06
same
19:07
the next exercise is finding the words
19:10
that have
19:10
opposite meaning pandero right circle
19:14
the word or words
19:15
in the sentence that are opposite
19:18
of the word in bold print what is
19:22
bold print that's the heavy dark
19:25

19:28
darker and bigger
19:30

19:33
that's this one here and this one so
19:36
uh let's circle the word or words that
19:39
are
19:40
opposite pandero of this one our word
19:42
here is
19:43
grab number one is grab so our sentence
19:46
is
19:46
poor mike his balloon is gone
19:50
he let it go out of his hand
19:54
so remember grab is to take and hold
19:57
in your hand right grab is to take and
20:00
hold in your hand
20:01
what's the opposite the opposite is here
20:04
he let it go if you let
20:08
something go that's the opposite of grab
20:11
grab is to take in your hand let it go
20:14
is to let it leave your hand and think
20:16
about
20:17
he had a balloon a balloon wants to go
20:20
up
20:21
but you hold on to it if you let go of
20:23
the string
20:25
the balloon goes away okay so let it go
20:28
grab opposite number two is protect
20:31
that's our word here
20:33
protect the rock is going to hurt the
20:35
boy
20:36
he should wear a helmet okay so protect
20:40
means to keep yourself safe
20:44
from danger so that you don't get
20:47
hurt right so protect the opposite of
20:51
course
20:51
is to hurt the opposite of protect
20:55
is to hurt something okay he should wear
20:58
a helmet
20:59
so that he doesn't get hurt so that he
21:02
protects himself
21:04
so protect and hurt are opposites
21:07
okay the third one the word is straight
21:12
straight what is the opposite of
21:15
straight
21:15
in the sentence or two sentences it is
21:19

21:22
the road gets mikroah mikro yeah microwa
21:26

21:30
this road is curved so be careful
21:33
there's two things you have to watch out
21:35
for one there's rain so it's mikroa
21:38
mikripta mikuro mikroyal that's
21:42
slippery the second thing is the road is
21:45
curved right so be careful now
21:48
it's curved is the opposite of straight
21:51
right
21:52
straight means doesn't change direction
21:54
keeps going the same direction
21:56
but curved means that it changes
21:58
direction and if you're driving
22:00
joshua right you have to be careful
22:03
especially
22:04
if it's wet because it's slippery you
22:07
