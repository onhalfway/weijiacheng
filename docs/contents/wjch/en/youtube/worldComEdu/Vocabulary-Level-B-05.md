small
lake a small lake small body of water a
small area of water
not a puddle not a puddle this is larger
than a puddle
a puddle is very small after it rains
you have maybe a little puddle of water
here but then the sun comes out
and then the puddle goes away this
doesn't go away
this stays here we call it a pond
but it's not a lake a lake is bigger
right you can go swimming in a lake
don't go swimming in the pond it's too
small and this
pond is a little dirty right you
shouldn't go swimming in a pond
right you better to go swimming in a
lake it's bigger
maybe cleaner i hope so but ponds are
smaller
you know puddle
right it's the the smallest puddle then
dalme
pond then the biggest is well big bigger
is lake
then c than ocean right so many
different
words to describe areas of water
okay we're talking about a pond here a
pond
okay 12 wow look at these these are nice
rocks
what do we call these what's another
word a
another word that means the same thing
as
a rock we can say a stone now of course
rocks and stones have many different
shapes
this is just one shape these stones
these rocks are very smooth and flat
i really like to find these rocks
especially
when i'm near a pond because you can
throw the rock
and it and it jumps on the water right
we
call that to skip skip
can you skip stones right
and we can say skipping stones right
they are skipping stones these are good
skipping stones you take them
you throw them on the water it hits
bounces
it skips one two three
four five wow that's great
if you can make a stone skip five
times that's a really good throw right
that's a really good throw
usually maybe two or three times okay
let's continue three what is this here
this is a deep a deep round
dish there are many kinds of dishes
right sometimes you have a dish for your
coffee
right that's just a small dish a bigger
dish you put your food on it
you eat off it that's a plate but if you
have
soup or stew like ramyan
right you want to put it inside this
don't put ramyan on a plate right it'll
go everywhere
a plate is flat you want to put ramyan
into this kind of dish
which is called a bowl a
bowl okay so put your soup your stew
your ramyun into a bowl
okay we saw this before
a tool used to cut things right when we
talked about
sharp we saw another example of course
this is a
knife be careful about the spelling it's
not
knife andel it's knife knife
the k is silent shh
don't say the k it's just knife
but we spell it with a k knife
english is crazy i'm sorry okay okay
15. oh we saw the other part right when
we talked about this
right we talked about this part already
this i'm not a good artist i'm sorry
this is the arrow
right arrow a weapon
for shooting arrows but now we're
talking about
this part right what do we call this
we call it a bow bow
b
in fact it's very common to say bow
and arrows that expression or that
phrase
is very co sorry no s just bow
and because you only use one bow you
don't use many
bow and arrows
but we say s because you have many
arrows right they you shoot them so bow
and
arrows are bow and arrow right so that's
a very common expression because these
two things
go together if you just have a bow no
arrow
what are you gonna do hit somebody right
now
you need the arrow to go with the bow
bow
and arrow that's the whole set
okay number 16 smooth
and even that's a nice picture right we
can say
it's flat and of course we can say about
this
computer monitor or tv screen many
people will call them
flat screens right
a flat screen because why a long time
ago well not a long time ago
maybe for you a long time ago not so
long for me
televisions were very fats right but now
with new technology
televisions aren't fat anymore they're
not deep they're
flat right they're very skinny but
instead of saying
skinny television we say flat television
or
flat screen it's a flat screen
okay so smooth and even it's flat
okay those are our words let's take a
look at the
exercises for the words here
we want to complete each sentence with
a word from the box so we have many
sentences
we have to complete the sentence with a
word
from the box let's review our words
first we have arrowhead
arrowhead next one useful
useful next is sharp
sharp next is tool
tool hammer
hammer famous
famous statue
statue and chisel
chisel okay let's see how these words
fit into the sentences number one a beep
is a rock shaped like a person
remember we saw that
rock many people were looking at it it
was very old she didn't have
pants on i made a joke about that right
what is it
what kind of rock is shaped like a
person out of these words
well here we look around ah we see the
answer right there
a statue is a rock shaped like a person
and remember it takes a very good artist
to shape a rock
like a person number two be careful
joshua mayo
right be careful the knife is oh
what what is it if the knife is this it
can cut your skin
very easily so be careful the knife is
what
the knife is sharp by the way
it's interesting the opposite pandero
of sharp would be what
we say it would be dole okay so
a knife can be dull that means it won't
cut
your skin very easily or it won't cut
tomatoes it won't cut meat
if you're trying to cut meat with a
knife it doesn't cut
this knife is dull so you need to
sharpen it you can
sharpen a knife make it sharp but be
careful
the knife is sharp it can cut meat but
it can also cut your skin
very easily okay number three
a stone knife is a a stone knife
that means a stone that you use
as a knife so if you're using a rock
or a stone as a knife what is it
it's not a stone or rock anymore it
becomes what
what are you using it as you're using it
as
a tool a stone knife is a tool
so a knife made of stone or a rock
that you use to cut something that is
now
not just a rock or a stone it's now a
tool
okay so a tool is something that you use
to get
something done okay next one four
you are beep if everyone knows you
so everybody knows your name right
everybody knows you that means you are
what okay you are of course
famous you are famous if everyone
knows you okay number five number five
starts off
watch out watch out is like joshim hale
before we saw be careful right
be careful watch out they mean the same
thing
but watch out with an exclamation
mark means it's more urgent
bali watch out bali joshua mail right
if you say be careful with this knife
that means later on be careful but you
say
watch out that means chigum watch out
right now
be careful something's happening oh
something's falling watch out a car is
moving
watch out right so watch out is like
joshim hale but right now okay
okay so watch out that beep is
sharp what can be sharp here well
there's a couple of things that can be
sharp but probably we're looking at
maybe this one over here
area arrowhead not area head arrowhead
that arrowhead head
is sharp watch out right be careful if
you're going to shoot the bow
because that arrowhead is sharp
be careful number six rocks can be
used for many things we can use
rocks used for many
things if something can be used for many
things
we can use it for many different uh
things that we want to do
we can say it is useful rocks

hit the nail
with the what do you use with a nail of
course

10:37
especially
10:38
when i'm near a pond because you can
10:41
throw the rock
10:42
and it and it jumps on the water right
10:45
we
10:46
call that to skip skip
10:50

11:00
skipping stones you take them
11:02
you throw them on the water it hits
11:04
bounces
11:05
it skips one two three
11:08
four five wow that's great
11:12
if you can make a stone skip five
11:15
times that's a really good throw right
11:18
that's a really good throw
11:20
usually maybe two or three times okay
11:23
let's continue three what is this here
11:26
this is a deep a deep round
11:30
dish there are many kinds of dishes
11:32
right sometimes you have a dish for your
11:34
coffee
11:35
right that's just a small dish a bigger
11:37
dish you put your food on it
11:39
you eat off it that's a plate but if you
11:42
have
11:42
soup or stew like ramyan
11:45
right you want to put it inside this
11:48
don't put ramyan on a plate right it'll
11:50
go everywhere
11:51
a plate is flat you want to put ramyan
11:54
into this kind of dish
11:56
which is called a bowl a
11:59
bowl okay so put your soup your stew
12:02
your ramyun into a bowl
12:05
okay we saw this before
12:09
a tool used to cut things right when we
12:12
talked about
12:13
sharp we saw another example of course
12:15
this is a
12:17
knife be careful about the spelling it's
12:19
not
12:20
knife andel it's knife knife
12:24
the k is silent shh
12:28
don't say the k it's just knife
12:32
but we spell it with a k knife
12:35
english is crazy i'm sorry okay okay
12:38
15. oh we saw the other part right when
12:41
we talked about this
12:43
right we talked about this part already
12:47
this i'm not a good artist i'm sorry
12:48
this is the arrow
12:51
right arrow a weapon
12:54
for shooting arrows but now we're
12:56
talking about
12:57
this part right what do we call this
13:01
we call it a bow bow
13:04
b
13:12
in fact it's very common to say bow
13:15
and arrows that expression or that
13:18
phrase
13:18
is very co sorry no s just bow
13:22
and because you only use one bow you
13:24
don't use many
13:25
bow and arrows
13:28
but we say s because you have many
13:32
arrows right they you shoot them so bow
13:35
and
13:35
arrows are bow and arrow right so that's
13:38
a very common expression because these
13:41
two things
13:42
go together if you just have a bow no
13:45
arrow
13:45
what are you gonna do hit somebody right
13:48
now
13:48
you need the arrow to go with the bow
13:51
bow
13:52
and arrow that's the whole set
13:55
okay number 16 smooth
13:59
and even that's a nice picture right we
14:01
can say
14:02
it's flat and of course we can say about
14:05
this
14:05
computer monitor or tv screen many
14:08
people will call them
14:10
flat screens right
14:13
a flat screen because why a long time
14:17
ago well not a long time ago
14:18
maybe for you a long time ago not so
14:21
long for me
14:22
televisions were very fats right but now
14:25
with new technology
14:27
televisions aren't fat anymore they're
14:28
not deep they're
14:30
flat right they're very skinny but
14:32
instead of saying
14:33
skinny television we say flat television
14:37
or
14:37
flat screen it's a flat screen
14:40
okay so smooth and even it's flat
14:44
okay those are our words let's take a
14:47
look at the
14:48
exercises for the words here
14:51
we want to complete each sentence with
14:54
a word from the box so we have many
14:57
sentences
14:58
we have to complete the sentence with a
15:00
word
15:01
from the box let's review our words
15:04
first we have arrowhead
15:08
arrowhead next one useful
15:12
useful next is sharp
15:16

15:39
fit into the sentences number one a beep
15:43

15:50
rock many people were looking at it it
15:52

15:56
what is it
15:57
what kind of rock is shaped like a
15:59

16:01
well here we look around ah we see the
16:03
answer right there
16:04
