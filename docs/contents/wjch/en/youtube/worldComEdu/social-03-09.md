hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
we're looking at social studies book 3
and we're doing lesson nine today of
course i'm brian stewart
good to see you today in today's lesson
we're going to be discovering or you
will discover
how america became a nation
in the last lesson we learned how
england
britain sent colonists over to america
but how did those settlements how did
those people
become a nation independent of
england or britain we'll discover that
in this lesson
and we'll also take a look at who some
early
american heroes were okay so that is the
idea for today's lesson
let's begin as usual with vocabulary
our first word is explain
when you explain something you make
something
easy to understand now be careful with
the word
explain don't say explain
about okay this is a
common mistake don't say i would like to
explain
about something no i would like to
explain
something there's no reason to use about
and when you explain something usually
you're talking about
how is
something done
for example i have a cell phone
i have there's an app i want to put on
my cell phone
i don't know how to do it so my
older brother will explain it
to me he will explain how to
install the app on my phone that is to
explain
how something is done he will not
explain about it
no he will explain it okay
so be careful using that word just means
to make something
easy to understand right now i am
explaining
to you how to use the word explain
see what i did okay very good let's move
on
okay unite unite means to come together
right
to join together as one group
in your class you have many different
students and they all have different
ideas they all have different interests
or
wants but the teacher tries to get the
class together and say
hey let's join together and all work
together
for one goal to learn something and then
you
unite as one group and that's very
important
when you want to accomplish a goal if
you work together
and you unite you can do the job much
more easily so that's a good idea unite
okay next one wow two words
long words american revolution
revolution now many countries have had
revolutions
right where they've sought independence
so but the american revolution
is the war in which american colonies
fought against england for their
independence and of course this happened
in sorry 1772
it's a date that all american school
kids know
very well because that's the date of the
declaration of independence
right and that is when uh the colonists
who were british subjects decided hey
we don't want to be british subjects
anymore we want to have our
own country and so they declared their
independence independence means
you do not accept the authority of
somebody
else you say we i can uh
i can live by myself by my own rules or
together as a group
we can make our own rules we can have
our own government
we don't want to be subjects of another
government
we want our own independence and that
was what the american revolution
was all about okay
last to la now last has a lot of
different
meanings right uh you know it's the
opposite of first
first last but that's not the meaning
here the meaning of last here means to
endure or to be or to exist
for a long time to endure
or to go on for a period of time
it will last right how long
will it last okay
so if you're uh having a hard time
sometimes
you know something's happening in
society or you know you have
some difficult circumstances don't worry
those circumstances will not last for a
long time
after a little while it will be over
sometimes you want things to last for a
long time right
if you're having a good time you're
enjoying some
activity with your friends you want it
to last
for a long time okay so last can have
negative
or positive meanings okay very good but
it just means to endure for a long time
okay next courage
are you brave if you are brave you have
courage right if you remember the story
about
dorothy and the land she goes to the
land of oz
and she meets a lion and the lion
is not brave the lion wants to see the
wizard of oz
to get his courage right so courage
is being brave to do something dangerous
or potentially painful right
nobody likes to go to the dentist right
oh it's painful but don't worry
be brave be courageous and it's good for
you to go to the dentist right it's good
for your health
okay so be brave be courageous
do the difficult things you know be
but be smart about dangerous things
right but sometimes you want to do
things that might be a little painful
difficult maybe a little bit dangerous
but remember safety first
because you need to do them to improve
yourself
or to protect yourself but especially to
improve yourself
over the long run okay so have
courage don't be shy don't be
timid right shy and timid are the
opposite of
brave and having courage right
so that's the opposite i'll do this that
shows opposite not equal opposite okay
good gain when you
gain something you get something right
so to gain something means
you get it or you win something i don't
know what this baby did
but he or she one gained a trophy right
i don't know about sports maybe maybe
sports for kids like that
looks like a sports trophy but anyway
you won something you
gained it so it game though kind of has
the idea that you worked
hard for something right and it was
difficult
and you after some difficult time a lot
of effort
you get it you gained it so if you study
for a long time you will gain some
important
understanding you will gain some
important knowledge
so studying is good okay next
warn now if i tell you
to be careful to watch out
for something that means i am warning
you
about something so warn means to tell
someone to be
careful about possible danger
or harm and of course this is a good
example road sign when you're driving a
car
your mom or dad can see signs on the
side of the road
and they warn them hey up ahead there's
a dangerous
curve right or in this case be careful
the road is slippery right if it's wet
or icy you have to be careful so the
road sign
will warn you about these dangers that
are coming up ahead
but warnings are not just on roadsides
they can you can get warnings from many
things
especially your friends and your parents
will warn you
about potential dangers listen to
warnings
and be careful think well
and be safe okay good those are our
words for this lesson
let's take a look at some of the main
ideas
here we have the first idea the birth
the birth
birth means new beginning right the it's
new
it just came out as something new it's
the birth the birth
of the united states of america
that is the whole name of the nation
known as america or
the usa u
s a united states of america
it's an important name to think about
because
when america became a nation
it wasn't one group or just
one colony or just one area it was
13 different areas it was 13 different
colonies and they were ute on the east
coast
that's where the development first
happened so it wasn't just one group it
was at
many different colonies and these
colonies wanted to be independent
and they didn't want to be called
colonies they wanted to be called states
okay so a state is a
an area that is ruled by one type of
government or one group
of people who rule that area that is a
state in america
and there are many states originally at
the beginning there were 13 states
nowadays as people moved west they made
many more states so now we have
50 states so there are 50 states
but they are states and they are united
they are together
and they make the country america so
that's why
america is called the united states of
america
but if you go to america it's like you
know you have 50 local governments
almost like countries but they're not
separate countries of course
they're under the federal government
which is the national government but
they're 50 different states
okay anyway what's going on here so what
is the
sequence of events that create that made
the birth of the united states first we
had the 13 colonies
were not happy with the unfair
laws made by england's king
so you know these people they're living
in england they are british subjects
they have to obey the king who's in
england who's very far away
and the king of england doesn't really
care
about you know i mean sure he should
care about the happiness and the
well-being
of the colonists but england doesn't
really regard america
as you know we can take advantage of
them right
we can we can make laws that are not
really fair to the americans but who
cares they're just colonists right
there they don't live in the home
country so the king made laws and taxes
that the american colonists said these
are unfair
it's not right that they should do that
so they were unhappy
so the king knew that the
uh the colonists were unhappy what did
he do
the king of england sent soldiers
sent soldiers to america right
because the colonists decided they
wanted independence
right so and they had a war this war is
called the american
revolution now um it's we're getting a
little out of order here
but that's okay american leaders
americans who said that they wanted to
be independent
of uh england signed the declaration of
independence and like i said before this
is the date that every school
child learns in america 1776
and july 4th july 4th nowadays is called
in d pendants
independence day and that is the day
every year on july 4th americans
celebrate
independence day they're celebrating
this event
almost 250 years ago
that when america became independent
of britain and the declaration of
independence was a very
important document that told the king of
england hey
we don't want to be ruled by a king we
want to rule ourselves
that was a very important event not only
for american history
history but for world history as well
okay so
they did this the war was going on the
colonies
won the war of course the colonies won
the war because nowadays we have
independence day and
the united states of america is a nation
so obviously the colonies won the war
against britain
it was a difficult war it wasn't a sure
thing
it was uh it was very difficult and
fought just by a few people really
and of course france helped america
against
their enemy the english so fran france
also america owes a debt
to france for their independence okay
they whose they they the colonies
became a free country and they called
themselves the united states of america
and i explained why because at first
they were 13 different states
but over time they became 50 different
states
and that is how america was born
or how it came to be a nation
who are some people that helped america
become
a nation uh two very important people
again every american school uh child
learns the names of these two peoples
along with others these aren't just
the only two people there are many
people but we only have room and time
for two people here these are two heroes
first we have paul revere
paul revere who is paul revere he is
very famous for making a
ride at night time in uh
in in the northern colonies i believe in
massachusetts near boston
he warned people that the british army
was coming there's a very famous story
about him
he was he was a patriot what they called
a patriot
and he was on the call on the
independent
side you're at the american side and he
his job was that if he heard word that
the british
were coming he would ride and warn
other people who were the american
soldiers
who were fighting against britain he
would warn them say hey get ready
get your guns everybody get ready
because the british soldiers are coming
there's a famous story about him looking
for a light there was another person
who was watching over the area where the
british would come
and the light would be like one if by
land
two if by sea i think that's how it goes
if i remember correctly
one if by lane so one light if the
british army was
marching two lights if the british were
coming in ships
one if by land two if by sea okay and so
paul revere saw the light
uh the warning light and he got on his
horse and he rode through
uh the area uh near boston and he
he was shouting hey people um the
british army are coming get your guns
get ready
and that was one of the first uh battles
in the american
independence movement in the american
revolution
because of him because he did that
americans were ready
when the british army came so the
british army didn't have
surprise right a lot of times especially
back then
armies depended on a surprise attack and
it was a very
easy victory if they could surprise the
enemy
and you know capture areas capture areas
very quickly
so they didn't have the element of
surprise because of paul revere and
because of paul revere
they were ready for the british
next person is george washington of
course
almost everybody knows who george
washington was george washington was
a british uh military leader
but he decided he joined with the
colonists who wanted independence from
america
so he became america's first general
and he was very important in
fighting the american revolution at one
time he only had like 5 000
soldiers and his soldiers were were
cold they didn't have a lot of food it
was in the middle of winter
and it was very dangerous situation
and they almost gave up right but george
washington wouldn't give up
he was very strong in his determination
to beat the british and he had some very
successful planning
george washington led the american army
during the american revolution
and because of his success and because
of his determination
and because of his sacrifices the
american people recognized him
after they won independence and they
elected him as the country's
first president after the war
so it was very important to he's a
president not a king
right a president is chosen by the
people the king becomes king because
you know he has a son and the new son
becomes the king or the daughter becomes
the queen
so um this is a very important event
in politics in world politics really
because first
now we have presidents we have leaders
who are chosen from the people
and not chosen by family okay so good
uh george washington and paul revere two
important american heroes
okay let's take a look at the reading
next
okay let's do the reading now and as
usual
go ahead and read along with me or
repeat along with me
and focus on the words from the
vocabulary section
are you ready here we go for a long time
the american colonies were ruled by
england the colonists were unhappy
with the unfair laws made by the king of
england
and the taxes they had to pay
so most americans wanted to be free
from the rule of england the colonists
decided to go
to war against england
the war was called the american
revolution
and would last eight years
in 1776 the american leaders
signed the declaration of
independence leaders like george
washington
and benjamin franklin were able
to explain why the colonists
should unite and act against
the british
the colonists had a lot of courage to
win the war
against england that's i'm just going to
interrupt there
a lot of courage that's true you know
i'm i can't go over a lot here because
we don't have a lot of time
but the declaration of independence was
a very important document
every person who signed the declaration
of independence
knew that if they lost the war
the british soldiers would come and
execute them
because they would be regarded as
traitors so they were
putting their lives on the line they
were putting their lives
at risk by signing the declaration of
independence
that took a lot of courage okay good
let's continue
many people helped the american
colonists
gain their freedom and independence
paul revere was one of them he warned
people
that the british showed i'm sorry
british soldiers
were coming so he warned people that the
british
soldiers were coming it's a little
difficult british
soldiers no british soldiers you have to
stop
and then pronounce s no h for soldiers
okay good so that is the reading let's
talk about how this reading passage is
organized here we have sequence right we
have a
sequence and we we saw this already when
we talked about the birth of the amer
of the united states of america what
happened first
what happened next and what happened
after that and maybe so on right but in
this case we have three things well
actually a few things
so first the colonists were unhappy with
what there were laws and especially
taxes
um again this is a short lesson but
there's a
another important event maybe you've
heard of it
it's called the boston tea party now
part of the thing that the colonists
thought was unfair
was that the british government was
raising taxes
on many goods that the
american colonists wanted for example if
the british if england sent tea to
america the colonists had to pay a lot
of money
on taxes for the tea it's kind of like a
cigarette tax nowadays but tea is
healthy
cigarettes is not healthy so let's not
confuse that anyway
the colonists were unhappy with unfair
it was unfair why are you charging us so
much money in taxes
that's not right you know why should we
have to pay so much
and we don't and the important thing
there also that's that's made the point
of is that
the colonists didn't have any power they
couldn't they didn't have any
voice in the british government
you know in the house of commons or the
house of lords which was the english
parliament
they didn't have any representation so
they were saying it's not fair
to get taxes when we have no
representation
right taxes without representation that
was a big thing
so it's unfair it's not fair to them so
it was
unfair unfair laws
and taxes so the colonists decided to go
to war
against england the war was called the
what it's two words we talked about it
it's kind of uh difficult right
the american revolution american
do i have room revolution
okay that's an n okay the american
revolution two words
and of course when you think about
history many countries have had
revolutions there have been many
colonies germany has had colonies
france has had colonies in places like
south america
in africa and other parts of the world
and these countries have wanted
independence right
and when they get independence many
times they have a revolution
not always but many times they've had a
revolution to get their independence
but the american revolution was probably
the first time
a colony became independent
from its home country so the american
leaders signed the declaration of what
declaration of independence they wanted
to be
free from british rule declaration of
in dependence
the declaration of independence
and they went to war how long was the
war how long did the war
last the war would last
eight years so how long when we talk
about a duration of time
how long you can say it lasted eight
years
how long was the movie it lasted one
and a half hours although we don't
really say that for a movie
last is like something that takes a long
time right you could say
the movie lasted uh one and a half hours
but usually say
the movie uh was one and a half hours
long that's probably more natural but
something very long and very difficult
it lasted it lasted eight years it's a
very long time for a war
right and like i said george washington
and his soldiers
went through a lot of sacrifices and
they had a very difficult time
over these eight years thankfully they
had some help from the french
okay good the colonists won the war
and gained beep and independence so what
was this war about
of course it was about independence but
what is independence
independence is freedom from
some authority that you don't that you
don't like anymore that you don't want
to be part of
so they gain freedom and that is
basically
the most important message free yeah i
can't
write and talk at the same time freedom
freedom is the most important message
from the american revolution
and it was a message that's that uh for
world history that's very important in
world history
that kind of went around the world it
was the first time
that a country that was ruled by a
king said hey we don't want a king
anymore
we want to be free we want to have the
ability to choose our
own political leaders we want to be
independent
from you know some hereditary
system of government we want to be able
to make
our own decisions make our own laws
make our own taxes by ourselves by
voting
by a democratic process and that's why
the american revolution is very
important for world history
because it showed an example of that and
that's very
these are very important values of
course for america
and americans the freedom and
independence
okay good so that is our lesson today
okay so yeah kind of again history
lesson but also of course we're trying
to focus on the english vocabulary
and english reading but also it's very
interesting to learn about history
and i'm sorry these lessons are so short
there's a lot of detail so i encourage
you to read more about the american
revolution
and read more about what happened and
why it was important
and what how it was significant and who
were some of the other heroes of the
american revolution and also
other revolutions in other countries
from from that time on
okay well thanks for uh thanks for
studying with me
we'll see you in the next lesson take
care everybody bye bye

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:11
textbook reading
00:12
we're looking at social studies book 3
00:15
and we're doing lesson nine today of
00:18
course i'm brian stewart
00:19
good to see you today in today's lesson
00:22
we're going to be discovering or you
00:24
will discover
00:25
how america became a nation
00:29
in the last lesson we learned how
00:31
england
00:32
britain sent colonists over to america
00:36
but how did those settlements how did
00:38
those people
00:39
become a nation independent of
00:42
england or britain we'll discover that
00:45
in this lesson
00:46
and we'll also take a look at who some
00:49
early
00:50
american heroes were okay so that is the
00:53
idea for today's lesson
00:55
let's begin as usual with vocabulary
00:59
our first word is explain
01:03
when you explain something you make
01:05
something
01:06
easy to understand now be careful with
01:09
the word
01:10
explain don't say explain
01:14
about okay this is a
01:17
common mistake don't say i would like to
01:20
explain
01:21
about something no i would like to
01:24
explain
01:25
something there's no reason to use about
01:28
and when you explain something usually
01:31
you're talking about
01:33
how is
01:36
something done
01:39
for example i have a cell phone
01:43
i have there's an app i want to put on
01:46
my cell phone
01:47
i don't know how to do it so my
01:50
older brother will explain it
01:54
to me he will explain how to
01:57
install the app on my phone that is to
02:01
explain
02:02
how something is done he will not
02:04
explain about it
02:05
no he will explain it okay
02:08
so be careful using that word just means
02:11
to make something
02:12
easy to understand right now i am
02:15
explaining
02:16
to you how to use the word explain
02:20
see what i did okay very good let's move
02:22
on
02:23
okay unite unite means to come together
02:27
right
02:28
to join together as one group
02:31
in your class you have many different
02:33
students and they all have different
02:35
ideas they all have different interests
02:38
or
02:39
wants but the teacher tries to get the
02:41
class together and say
02:42
hey let's join together and all work
02:45
together
02:46
for one goal to learn something and then
02:49
you
02:49
unite as one group and that's very
02:52
important
02:53
when you want to accomplish a goal if
02:55
you work together
02:56
and you unite you can do the job much
02:59
more easily so that's a good idea unite
03:03
okay next one wow two words
03:07
long words american revolution
03:10
revolution now many countries have had
03:13
revolutions
03:14
right where they've sought independence
03:17
so but the american revolution
03:19
is the war in which american colonies
03:22
fought against england for their
03:26
independence and of course this happened
03:29
in sorry 1772
03:32
it's a date that all american school
03:35
kids know
03:35
very well because that's the date of the
03:38
declaration of independence
03:40
right and that is when uh the colonists
03:43
who were british subjects decided hey
03:47
we don't want to be british subjects
03:50
anymore we want to have our
03:52
own country and so they declared their
03:55
independence independence means
03:58
you do not accept the authority of
04:01
somebody
04:02
else you say we i can uh
04:05
i can live by myself by my own rules or
04:08
together as a group
04:10
we can make our own rules we can have
04:12
our own government
04:14
we don't want to be subjects of another
04:17
government
04:17
we want our own independence and that
04:20
was what the american revolution
04:23
was all about okay
04:26
last to la now last has a lot of
04:29
different
04:30
meanings right uh you know it's the
04:32
opposite of first
04:33
first last but that's not the meaning
04:36
here the meaning of last here means to
04:39
endure or to be or to exist
04:42
for a long time to endure
04:45
or to go on for a period of time
04:49
it will last right how long
04:52
will it last okay
04:56
so if you're uh having a hard time
04:58
sometimes
04:59
you know something's happening in
05:01
society or you know you have
05:04
some difficult circumstances don't worry
05:07
those circumstances will not last for a
05:10
long time
05:11
after a little while it will be over
05:14
sometimes you want things to last for a
05:16
long time right
05:18
if you're having a good time you're
05:20
enjoying some
05:22
activity with your friends you want it
05:24
to last
05:25
for a long time okay so last can have
05:28
negative
05:29
or positive meanings okay very good but
05:32
it just means to endure for a long time
05:35
okay next courage
05:38
are you brave if you are brave you have
05:42
courage right if you remember the story
05:44
about
05:45
dorothy and the land she goes to the
05:47
land of oz
05:48
and she meets a lion and the lion
05:52
is not brave the lion wants to see the
05:54
wizard of oz
05:55
to get his courage right so courage
05:59
is being brave to do something dangerous
06:03
or potentially painful right
06:07
nobody likes to go to the dentist right
06:10
oh it's painful but don't worry
06:12
be brave be courageous and it's good for
06:14
you to go to the dentist right it's good
06:16
for your health
06:17
okay so be brave be courageous
06:20
do the difficult things you know be
06:24
but be smart about dangerous things
06:26
right but sometimes you want to do
06:28
things that might be a little painful
06:30
difficult maybe a little bit dangerous
06:32
but remember safety first
06:34
because you need to do them to improve
06:37
yourself
06:37
or to protect yourself but especially to
06:40
improve yourself
06:41
over the long run okay so have
06:44
courage don't be shy don't be
06:48
timid right shy and timid are the
06:51
opposite of
06:54
brave and having courage right
06:58
so that's the opposite i'll do this that
07:02
shows opposite not equal opposite okay
07:05
good gain when you
07:08
gain something you get something right
07:11
so to gain something means
07:13
you get it or you win something i don't
07:15
know what this baby did
07:17
but he or she one gained a trophy right
07:22
i don't know about sports maybe maybe
07:23
sports for kids like that
07:25
looks like a sports trophy but anyway
07:27
you won something you
07:29
gained it so it game though kind of has
07:32
the idea that you worked
07:33
hard for something right and it was
07:36
difficult
07:36
and you after some difficult time a lot
07:39
of effort
07:40
you get it you gained it so if you study
07:44
for a long time you will gain some
07:46
important
07:47
understanding you will gain some
07:49
important knowledge
07:50
so studying is good okay next
07:55
warn now if i tell you
07:58
to be careful to watch out
08:01
for something that means i am warning
08:04
you
08:04
about something so warn means to tell
08:07
someone to be
08:08
careful about possible danger
08:11
or harm and of course this is a good
08:14
example road sign when you're driving a
08:17
car
08:18
your mom or dad can see signs on the
08:21
side of the road
08:22
and they warn them hey up ahead there's
08:25
a dangerous
08:26
curve right or in this case be careful
08:29
the road is slippery right if it's wet
08:33
or icy you have to be careful so the
08:35
road sign
08:36
will warn you about these dangers that
08:39
are coming up ahead
08:41
but warnings are not just on roadsides
08:43
they can you can get warnings from many
08:45
things
08:46
especially your friends and your parents
08:49
will warn you
08:50
about potential dangers listen to
08:53
warnings
08:54
and be careful think well
08:58
and be safe okay good those are our
09:01
words for this lesson
09:05
let's take a look at some of the main
09:07
ideas
09:08
here we have the first idea the birth
09:10
the birth
09:12
birth means new beginning right the it's
09:15
new
09:15
it just came out as something new it's
09:18
the birth the birth
09:19
of the united states of america
09:22
that is the whole name of the nation
09:26
known as america or
09:28
the usa u
09:31
s a united states of america
09:35
it's an important name to think about
09:36
because
09:38
when america became a nation
09:42
it wasn't one group or just
09:45
one colony or just one area it was
09:49
13 different areas it was 13 different
09:53
colonies and they were ute on the east
09:56
coast
09:56
that's where the development first
09:58
happened so it wasn't just one group it
10:00
was at
10:00
many different colonies and these
10:02
colonies wanted to be independent
10:04
and they didn't want to be called
10:05
colonies they wanted to be called states
10:08
okay so a state is a
10:12
an area that is ruled by one type of
10:15
government or one group
10:16
of people who rule that area that is a
10:18
state in america
10:20
and there are many states originally at
10:22
the beginning there were 13 states
10:25
nowadays as people moved west they made
10:28
many more states so now we have
10:31
50 states so there are 50 states
10:34
but they are states and they are united
10:36
they are together
10:37
and they make the country america so
10:40
that's why
10:41
america is called the united states of
10:43
america
10:44
but if you go to america it's like you
10:46
know you have 50 local governments
10:49
almost like countries but they're not
10:51
separate countries of course
10:52
they're under the federal government
10:54
which is the national government but
10:56
they're 50 different states
10:58
okay anyway what's going on here so what
11:01
is the
11:02
sequence of events that create that made
11:05
the birth of the united states first we
11:07
had the 13 colonies
11:08
were not happy with the unfair
11:13
laws made by england's king
11:16
so you know these people they're living
11:18
in england they are british subjects
11:20
they have to obey the king who's in
11:22
england who's very far away
11:25
and the king of england doesn't really
11:28
care
11:29
about you know i mean sure he should
11:31
care about the happiness and the
11:32
well-being
11:34
of the colonists but england doesn't
11:36
really regard america
11:37
as you know we can take advantage of
11:40
them right
11:41
we can we can make laws that are not
11:43
really fair to the americans but who
11:45
cares they're just colonists right
11:47
there they don't live in the home
11:48
country so the king made laws and taxes
11:51
that the american colonists said these
11:53
are unfair
11:54
it's not right that they should do that
11:56
so they were unhappy
11:58
so the king knew that the
12:02
uh the colonists were unhappy what did
12:04
he do
12:05
the king of england sent soldiers
12:08
sent soldiers to america right
12:12
because the colonists decided they
12:14
wanted independence
12:16
right so and they had a war this war is
12:19
called the american
12:20
revolution now um it's we're getting a
12:24
little out of order here
12:25
but that's okay american leaders
12:28
americans who said that they wanted to
12:30
be independent
12:32
of uh england signed the declaration of
12:35
independence and like i said before this
12:37
is the date that every school
12:39
child learns in america 1776
12:43
and july 4th july 4th nowadays is called
12:47
in d pendants
12:54
independence day and that is the day
12:57
every year on july 4th americans
12:59
celebrate
13:00
independence day they're celebrating
13:02
this event
13:04
almost 250 years ago
13:08
that when america became independent
13:11
of britain and the declaration of
13:13
independence was a very
13:15
important document that told the king of
13:18
england hey
13:19
we don't want to be ruled by a king we
13:22
want to rule ourselves
13:24
that was a very important event not only
13:26
for american history
13:27
history but for world history as well
13:30
okay so
13:31
they did this the war was going on the
13:34
colonies
13:35
won the war of course the colonies won
13:37
the war because nowadays we have
13:38
independence day and
13:40
the united states of america is a nation
13:41
so obviously the colonies won the war
13:44
against britain
13:45
it was a difficult war it wasn't a sure
13:47
thing
13:48
it was uh it was very difficult and
13:51
fought just by a few people really
13:53
and of course france helped america
13:56
against
13:56
their enemy the english so fran france
14:00
also america owes a debt
14:03
to france for their independence okay
14:07
they whose they they the colonies
14:10
became a free country and they called
14:12
themselves the united states of america
14:14
and i explained why because at first
14:17
they were 13 different states
14:19
but over time they became 50 different
14:21
states
14:22
and that is how america was born
14:26
or how it came to be a nation
14:31
who are some people that helped america
14:33
become
14:34
a nation uh two very important people
14:37
again every american school uh child
14:41
learns the names of these two peoples
14:43
along with others these aren't just
14:45
the only two people there are many
14:47
people but we only have room and time
14:49
for two people here these are two heroes
14:51
first we have paul revere
14:53
paul revere who is paul revere he is
14:56
very famous for making a
14:58
ride at night time in uh
15:02
in in the northern colonies i believe in
15:03
massachusetts near boston
15:06
he warned people that the british army
15:08
was coming there's a very famous story
15:10
about him
15:12
he was he was a patriot what they called
15:15
a patriot
15:15
and he was on the call on the
15:18
independent
15:19
side you're at the american side and he
15:22
his job was that if he heard word that
15:25
the british
15:26
were coming he would ride and warn
15:29
other people who were the american
15:31
soldiers
15:32
who were fighting against britain he
15:33
would warn them say hey get ready
15:35
get your guns everybody get ready
15:37
because the british soldiers are coming
15:40
there's a famous story about him looking
15:41
for a light there was another person
15:43
who was watching over the area where the
15:45
british would come
15:46
and the light would be like one if by
15:49
land
15:50
two if by sea i think that's how it goes
15:52
if i remember correctly
15:53
one if by lane so one light if the
15:56
british army was
15:57
marching two lights if the british were
15:59
coming in ships
16:01
one if by land two if by sea okay and so
16:04
paul revere saw the light
16:05
uh the warning light and he got on his
16:08
horse and he rode through
16:09
uh the area uh near boston and he
16:12
he was shouting hey people um the
16:15
british army are coming get your guns
16:17
get ready
16:18
and that was one of the first uh battles
16:21
in the american
16:22
independence movement in the american
16:25
revolution
16:26
because of him because he did that
16:28
americans were ready
16:30
when the british army came so the
16:32
british army didn't have
16:33
surprise right a lot of times especially
16:36
back then
16:37
armies depended on a surprise attack and
16:40
it was a very
16:41
easy victory if they could surprise the
16:44
enemy
16:44
and you know capture areas capture areas
16:48
very quickly
16:49
so they didn't have the element of
16:52
surprise because of paul revere and
16:54
because of paul revere
16:55
they were ready for the british
16:58
next person is george washington of
17:01
course
17:02
almost everybody knows who george
17:03
washington was george washington was
17:06
a british uh military leader
17:09
but he decided he joined with the
17:12
colonists who wanted independence from
17:13
america
17:14
so he became america's first general
17:18
and he was very important in
17:21
fighting the american revolution at one
17:23
time he only had like 5 000
17:25
soldiers and his soldiers were were
17:28
cold they didn't have a lot of food it
17:30
was in the middle of winter
17:32
and it was very dangerous situation
17:35
and they almost gave up right but george
17:37
washington wouldn't give up
17:39
he was very strong in his determination
17:42
to beat the british and he had some very
17:45
successful planning
17:46
george washington led the american army
17:48
during the american revolution
17:50
and because of his success and because
17:52
of his determination
17:54
and because of his sacrifices the
17:57
american people recognized him
17:59
after they won independence and they
18:01
elected him as the country's
18:03
first president after the war
18:08
so it was very important to he's a
18:10
president not a king
18:12
right a president is chosen by the
18:14
people the king becomes king because
18:17
you know he has a son and the new son
18:19
becomes the king or the daughter becomes
18:21
the queen
18:22
so um this is a very important event
18:25
in politics in world politics really
18:28
because first
18:29
now we have presidents we have leaders
18:31
who are chosen from the people
18:33
and not chosen by family okay so good
18:36
uh george washington and paul revere two
18:39
important american heroes
18:41
okay let's take a look at the reading
18:43
next
18:44
okay let's do the reading now and as
18:47
usual
18:48
go ahead and read along with me or
18:50
repeat along with me
18:51
and focus on the words from the
18:53
vocabulary section
18:54
are you ready here we go for a long time
18:59
the american colonies were ruled by
19:02
england the colonists were unhappy
19:06
with the unfair laws made by the king of
19:09
england
19:10
and the taxes they had to pay
19:15
so most americans wanted to be free
19:19
from the rule of england the colonists
19:23
decided to go
19:24
to war against england
19:28
the war was called the american
19:30
revolution
19:31
and would last eight years
19:37
in 1776 the american leaders
19:41
signed the declaration of
19:44
independence leaders like george
19:48
washington
19:49
and benjamin franklin were able
19:52
to explain why the colonists
19:55
should unite and act against
19:59
the british
20:02
the colonists had a lot of courage to
20:05
win the war
20:07
against england that's i'm just going to
20:10
interrupt there
20:11
a lot of courage that's true you know
20:13
i'm i can't go over a lot here because
20:15
we don't have a lot of time
20:16
but the declaration of independence was
20:18
a very important document
20:21
every person who signed the declaration
20:23
of independence
20:24
knew that if they lost the war
20:28
the british soldiers would come and
20:31
execute them
20:32
because they would be regarded as
20:33
traitors so they were
20:35
putting their lives on the line they
20:38
were putting their lives
20:39
at risk by signing the declaration of
20:42
independence
20:43
that took a lot of courage okay good
20:46
let's continue
20:47
many people helped the american
20:50
colonists
20:51
gain their freedom and independence
20:55
paul revere was one of them he warned
20:58
people
20:58
that the british showed i'm sorry
21:01
british soldiers
21:02
were coming so he warned people that the
21:06
british
21:06
soldiers were coming it's a little
21:09
difficult british
21:10
soldiers no british soldiers you have to
21:13
stop
21:14
and then pronounce s no h for soldiers
21:17
okay good so that is the reading let's
21:20
talk about how this reading passage is
21:23
organized here we have sequence right we
21:26
have a
21:26
sequence and we we saw this already when
21:28
we talked about the birth of the amer
21:30
of the united states of america what
21:32
happened first
21:33
what happened next and what happened
21:35
after that and maybe so on right but in
21:37
this case we have three things well
21:39
actually a few things
21:40
so first the colonists were unhappy with
21:44
what there were laws and especially
21:46
taxes
21:47
um again this is a short lesson but
21:50
there's a
21:50
another important event maybe you've
21:53
heard of it
21:54
it's called the boston tea party now
21:57
part of the thing that the colonists
22:01
thought was unfair
22:02
was that the british government was
22:04
raising taxes
22:06
on many goods that the
22:09
american colonists wanted for example if
22:12
the british if england sent tea to
22:15
america the colonists had to pay a lot
22:16
of money
22:17
on taxes for the tea it's kind of like a
22:20
cigarette tax nowadays but tea is
22:21
healthy
22:22
cigarettes is not healthy so let's not
22:24
confuse that anyway
22:25
the colonists were unhappy with unfair
22:27
it was unfair why are you charging us so
22:29
much money in taxes
22:31
that's not right you know why should we
22:33
have to pay so much
22:34
and we don't and the important thing
22:36
there also that's that's made the point
22:38
of is that
22:38
the colonists didn't have any power they
22:41
couldn't they didn't have any
22:42
voice in the british government
22:46
you know in the house of commons or the
22:48
house of lords which was the english
22:49
parliament
22:50
they didn't have any representation so
22:53
they were saying it's not fair
22:55
to get taxes when we have no
22:57
representation
22:58
right taxes without representation that
23:01
was a big thing
23:02
so it's unfair it's not fair to them so
23:05
it was
23:06
unfair unfair laws
23:09
and taxes so the colonists decided to go
23:13
to war
23:14
against england the war was called the
23:18
what it's two words we talked about it
23:20
it's kind of uh difficult right
23:22
the american revolution american
23:27
do i have room revolution
23:33
okay that's an n okay the american
23:36
revolution two words
23:37
and of course when you think about
23:39
history many countries have had
23:41
revolutions there have been many
23:42
colonies germany has had colonies
23:45
france has had colonies in places like
23:47
south america
23:48
in africa and other parts of the world
23:51
and these countries have wanted
23:52
independence right
23:54
and when they get independence many
23:56
times they have a revolution
23:57
not always but many times they've had a
24:00
revolution to get their independence
24:02
but the american revolution was probably
24:04
the first time
24:05
a colony became independent
24:08
from its home country so the american
24:12
leaders signed the declaration of what
24:14
declaration of independence they wanted
24:17
to be
24:18
free from british rule declaration of
24:21
in dependence
24:29
the declaration of independence
24:32
and they went to war how long was the
24:35
war how long did the war
24:38
last the war would last
24:41
eight years so how long when we talk
24:44
about a duration of time
24:46
how long you can say it lasted eight
24:49
years
24:49
how long was the movie it lasted one
24:52
and a half hours although we don't
24:54
really say that for a movie
24:56
last is like something that takes a long
24:58
time right you could say
25:00
the movie lasted uh one and a half hours
25:02
but usually say
25:03
the movie uh was one and a half hours
25:06
long that's probably more natural but
25:09
something very long and very difficult
25:12
it lasted it lasted eight years it's a
25:14
very long time for a war
25:16
right and like i said george washington
25:18
and his soldiers
25:19
went through a lot of sacrifices and
25:22
they had a very difficult time
25:24
over these eight years thankfully they
25:26
had some help from the french
25:28
okay good the colonists won the war

25:38
what is independence
25:40
independence is freedom from

some authority that you don't that you
25:45

26:00
freedom is the most important message
26:01
from the american revolution

26:15
king said hey we don't want a king
26:17

26:18
we want to be free we want to have the
26:21
ability to choose our
26:22

26:25
independent
26:26

by a democratic process and that's why
26:43
the american revolution is very
26:45
important for world history
