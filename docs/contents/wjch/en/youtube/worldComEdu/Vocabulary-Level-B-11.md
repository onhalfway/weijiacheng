robert wadlow was really really tall so
in this lesson
we'll learn about him but first we
should go over the vocabulary
number one who is this guy a young kid
right he's going like this right he is a
boy who helps
people wears a uniform he has a number
on his sleeve according to the group he
belongs to
who is he he's a boy scout
a boy scout boy scout is a boy who helps
people boy scout it's two words
so boy scout boy scout
okay number two we have a picture of
abraham lincoln i an american president
a long time ago right when we think
about
what happened long ago we think about
the stories
of people's lives and events
that happened a long time ago we are
talking about
history history not
his story no history
history okay three
if somebody makes a shirt
or pants or something that is made
just for you only for you
right now only for you it's made
just for you not anybody else
only for you what do we say it is
custom so if a person
makes a shirt and measures
just your body and makes a shirt just
for you
that's a custom shirt many times if
you're walking around your city
you might see the words custom tailor
on some shops a custom
tailor a tailor
taylor is this person here a person
who makes clothing and custom they
measure it they make it just for you
so it's very common when people make
clothes you can see
custom tailor okay next word
these are different lots of different
pictures here right but look at this
it says usa 10 cents in korea
you don't usually use these very often
when you go to the post office they just
use a stamp nowadays
i'm just a like a right they just
punch your letter but a long time ago
you could buy
one of these it's what we use to send
a letter and of course i said it before
it's a stamp a stamp is a small
uh thing it's like a sticker right you
know the word sticker
and you you lick the back of it and you
put it on your envelope
of course in america people lick it in
korea they use the glue right
and they put it onto the punji the
envelope okay
but a lot of times in korea you guys
don't use stamps anymore
when i go to the post office right the
lady she goes
she takes a big stamp it's called a
stamp but boom and it puts the ink
on the letter it's not a small stamp a
small piece of paper
that i glue okay so it's maybe more
efficient that way
okay but the stamp is what you put on
the letter
and people still use stamps in some
places
five wow look at this there's a really
small guy here
and a really big guy here of course it's
trick photography right there they're
using trick
photography trick photography
trick photography it's where the
photographer you know they move them
well
he's close he's far right so it's trick
photography
but anyway if you think about this this
person is a very big
person if these two people were at the
same distance
not like this but same wow he would be
huge
what would he be he would be a giant
giant giant so somebody who's
really big or really big this way or
really
tall we call that person a giant
okay now here we have not special

doing
he's looking up at the surface at the
top of the room
it's the part of a room above your head
of course we know we have the floor
under us
we have walls to the side but what do we
call that
on top of us what is that uh area of the
room that's above our head
we call it a ceiling
ceiling ceiling so c
ling it's like c same pronunciation
different spelling c ling
ceiling ceiling very easy it's the part
of the room
that's over you had ceiling walls

the next one here to gather and save
remember we were talking about
stamps before these are many types of
stamps
some people like to gather
to gather these stamps i almost said the
word to gather these stamps together
and to save them maybe they put them in
a book other people

butterflies or other types of bugs
there's many things that you can
collect collect
and when you say it don't say collect

collect collect there's many things that
you can collect
you can collect stamps you can collect
coins you can collect insects
right bole okay but when you collect
these things that's the verb
when you have them all together you can
call it
a collection collection
collection that's noun right
so verb is to collect but the collection
all of those things together that's a
noun
do you want to see my stamp collection

okay so maybe you have a collection some
people like to
to play that a card game right uh i
don't know what it's called
uh but you have the different cards the
different characters
and you can i think it's yu-gi-oh
something like that
yugioh i'm not sure but people will
collect those
cards so there's many many things that
you can collect
and you can have a collection okay
number nine oh look at these two kids
right
not short okay so one kid is short maybe
she's younger
the older kid maybe he's older but he's
what
he's tall okay tall and when we compare
them
he is taller than
she is so tall er
if you're going to compare tall and

compare them
10 a place to go and buy things
to go and buy things if you go to a
place like this
what do you call that it's not a
supermarket this is not a supermarket
it's a store and there's many small
stores
downtown right you can go in and you can
buy
certain things it's a store of course we
can say a supermarket

something
for someone else what
what is he doing he is doing what for
her right
he is doing something for her
he is helping her so the man is helping
the woman
the woman is not helping the man right
she's making it more difficult for the
man
but the man is helping her maybe he's
moving her boxes her
clothes her things from one place to
another
so when you help somebody right somebody
says can you help me
can you help carry this box sure
i can help you okay remember the first
word we learned was boy scout
a boy who helps other people to help
somebody
to do something for someone else
next one does your closet

wear on our bodies what do we call
of course these are called shirts but we
want to talk about
not just shirts but pants socks

what do we call them we call them
clothes
now maybe that's a bit hinduro
right it's a little difficult to
pronounce we say
cl clothes
t-h-e-s that's a bit of a difficult
pronunciation
close close
think about this do you know this word
here
close close the door
that's easy right close the door this is
the same pronunciation
clothes i am wearing clothes but
remember
clothes is a noun clothes here is a verb
so make sure you spell it correctly
right
and think about the difference right
you're not closing the door
you're wearing clothes but it's the same
pronunciation
clothes how many clothes do you have
are you wearing nice clothes today
or are you wearing casual clothes
casual clothes is like shorts right
shorts and a t-shirt that's casual
clothes nice clothes or formal clothes
is a nice business shirt long pants
nice shoes okay so you can wear
different
types of clothes many different kinds
of clothes okay 13
to be the right size this woman
wants to buy a dress she wants to buy a
dress that's not too big
not too small right but it should do
what
it should fit it should fit her
it fits her fit in this case
is a verb it
fits her
if we say that if we say it oh sorry
if if we say it fits her it's the right
size
it's not too big not too small right if
you move
i broke it you rip it right it's just
the right size
it fits you so does it
fit when you go to the store you try on
a shirt
you try on pants think about does it
fit it fits you well it's the right
size number fourteen
something to sit on so it looks like
this this is of course
is in a car right or maybe on a bus
okay but also you have another one in
your room that has
legs not as comfortable but it's also
you can also call it that
it's a seat a seat something to sit on
it's a seat you could also say a
chair is a place to sit on but a chair
has a seat
right where can i sit
many people say is there a seat on the
bus
is there a seat in the restaurant there
are no
seats that means no place to sit down
no place to sit down no seats no place
to sit on
so it's seat seat
okay next one number 15 cute girl right
where your face her face
her hair and ears are
but also you know faces eyes nose and
mouth
chin cheeks right where are
all these things where do we say they're
on our head
these things are on our head our ears
face
hair that's all on our head right
anything above the neck
is our head last word
oh nice picture all right a mother or
a father this is a family right we have
father
mother child what do we call just the
mother or the father there's a word we
use
just to say like one person right
whether it's a man
or a woman doesn't matter it means they
have a child
what do we call them we call them a
parent
a parent a parent is a mother or
father so parent doesn't mean namja or
yoja
it can be both right parent is
namja rang yoja we don't know you just
say
parent who is the parent of this child
there's a father and a mother there's
one parent two parents right there's two
parents
but we just say parent father is namja
mother is yoja right woman
so and father is man but parent doesn't
matter
it can be man or woman okay
that wraps up the words let's go over
the exercises
in this exercise we have complete each
sentence
with a word from the box so we have the
sentences here
we have a blank we need to use one of
these words
to fill in the blanks let's go over the
words the words are

history history
next one custom custom
the next one is ceiling ceiling
and the next one is giant giant
okay number one robert was
as tall as a tree
how tall are trees go outside look at
the tree oh my gosh it's really tall
so if somebody is as tall as a tree he
was a what
what was he was he a boy scout that
doesn't make sense because boy scouts
are
are usually short you know boy scouts
are different
heights boy scouts aren't as tall as a
tree who is as tall as a tree
of course a giant is as tall as a tree
he was a giant right if a person is as
tall as a tree
they're really big really tall they are
a giant
number two we study beep
to learn about the past about the past
things that happened a long time ago
right what is that
that of course is history we study
history
to learn about the past okay number
three
robert was a beep baby he was small
and cute now babies
are small and cute that's ordinary right
most babies almost all babies are small
and cute that's not different that's
typical that
is normal that's usual right
the usual case he was a normal baby
there was nothing special or different
about him
he was a normal baby small and cute
number four he was so tall so
tall that right when you sow
you're expecting to hear that so
tall that so cold that so
hot that okay he was so tall
that his head touched the what right
if you're in a room there's a floor on
the bottom
walls on the side but think about a
giant somebody who's really tall
their head touches what what's on the
top there
of course ceiling he was so tall
that his head touched the ceiling
okay number five robert had
deep clothes what kind of clothes we
need to look at the second sentence
they were made just for him
just for him so remember if something is
made
just for you it is
custom robert had custom clothes
they were made just for him
okay number six he has all kinds of
coins
right somebody who gathers many
different types of coins
he likes to do what of course if he
gathers these
many different types of coins he has a
large
collection of coins it means he likes to
collect he likes to collect them
so he has a large collection
okay number seven robert was a
peep and he could help people so robert
was a what
a person who helps people which
one is a person who helps
people it's over here isn't it robert
was a boy scout
and he could help people okay
and eight you need beep to mail
a letter we talked about that right of
course people don't use them
in korea that often these days but
a while ago and you can still get them
right it's a little piece of paper you
put glue on the back
and you stick it to your pinji your
envelope
what is it it's stamp right you need
stamps
to mail a letter maybe one stamp
maybe several stamps right if you have
to get the right number
right so of course people had to buy the
right number of stamps
that was a little hymduro so nowadays
they you did they just
use the stamper and it gives you the
exact amount how much you need
and that's why people don't use stamps
that much anymore
because it's easier okay but anyway
those are our words
we're going to need to know those words
for the reading which is
coming up soon after the break so don't

they you did they just
20:45
use the stamper and it gives you the
20:48
exact amount how much you need
20:50
and that's why people don't use stamps
20:53
