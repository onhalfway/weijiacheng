hello kids
how are you doing today welcome back to
reading for vocabulary i'm brian stewart
we're on lesson six fossil
fuels so in this lesson we will focus on
let's learn about how plants from
long ago can cause pollution
today and of course pollution is not
good for
our bodies so our topic our subject is
health right so that's what we'll be
talking about
in this lesson let's take a look here
first of all
what are fossil fuels there are many
kinds of fossil fuels in this video here
we can see these machines working
in a field or in a plane what are these
machines doing
they're getting oil from the ground
they're pumping
up oil from deep underground and
oil oil is
a fossil fuel we make gas
out of oil right
i think you say in korean kyung yoo
right uh
where you go to the juju so the gas
station and you get
fuel right so oil is made into gas
it's a type of fossil fuel also we'll
look at
other types of fossil fuels in this
lesson
okay our first word for the vocabulary
he's very happy he's very proud i hope
you get the same thing
he got an a plus yay right it can be
done
yes you can get an a plus it is
possible yes you can do it right
it's possible you can do it
you can do it it is possible
okay number two wow very exciting
picture
of course he is a firefighter
fighter and the word though is not
firefighter it is to
need now when we say to need what's
another word for that
it's require a firefighter
needs water to put out the fire
he requires water
to put out the fire to require
now maybe a little difficult
pronunciation require
require so to require is to need
something you say pill yohada right
i need it i need it i require it
it i must have it okay number three this
is a big city looks like
new york central park is in the
background but when we talk about
all big cities any big city connected
with
a city connected with a city we say
urban urban so if you
live in a city you are living
in an urban setting you are living in an
urban setting but if you live on a
farm in the countryside you are living
in a rural setting so
urban and rural
rural pandero right they are opposites
so i live in a city i live in an
urban place or setting i live in a farm
i live in a rural place or setting
okay so rural is countryside urban is
city okay number four
having to do with factories so when we
say when we talk about
factories and factories that are making
things and machines
the process of manufacturing we're
usually talking about industrial
topics or industrial things industrial
is an
adjective having to do with factories
this job is an industrial job
right uh this uh business deal is an
industrial business deal having to do
with
factories industrial
industrial industrial okay so the
pronunciation it's a long word
industry oh industrial
okay okay next one number five well this
is very interesting
what is this if we look closely
this is rock right it's part it's a
piece of rock
but there's some strange oh it looks
kind of scary it's a spider
right it's a spider that died a long
long
time ago and a long time ago this
rock was mud it was soft and the
spider's body
laid there and got covered with mud and
got pressed and because of the pressure
it turned into rock so that all that is
left
of the spider is this form or the
shape in the rock it's all that
remains all that remains the remains of
the spider
is all that is left of this spider is
the shape of the spider
in the rock so if something is gone
something it goes away or something dies
sometimes there are there's a little bit
that remains
from that thing that died a long time
ago
remains remains
okay next one number six uh to come
together
when things come together what do they
do
they form something okay so they
form a field they might form
a landscape when you put like
wood and concrete and other materials
together
you can form a house or a building it's
when
you make you have many things or
materials
come together they form or make
or create some other thing they form
something okay seven
are you hungry looks like somebody's
cooking something right
a series of actions or changes when you
cook
something you're doing a series of
actions step one
step two step three you follow many
actions or changes different steps
we call all of those steps together
that's called
a process what is the process of making
chocolate chip
cookies what is the process of making a
pancake
you follow the different steps those
steps
are a process how to do something
okay next one number eight maybe your
mom or dad does this a lot maybe you do
it
right if the light goes out in your room
you know you flip the switch
it doesn't work it's time to change
something for something else
so you take the old light bulb
it's a light bulb by the way you take
the
old light bulb and you put a new light
bulb in its place
what are you doing you are replacing
replace
the old one with a new one you replace
the old one
get rid of the old one put a new one you
replace it
replace the old one with a new one
replace the old light bulb
with a new light bulb okay number nine
to let go right very interesting picture
i think it's been photoshopped okay but
anyway
this person is letting these doves these
birds go
right to let go means to release
let go right if you love something
release it if it comes back to you it
loves you too
but if it doesn't come back it never was
to be
oh well so anyway to release something
to release
let it go let it go release it release
release let it go number 10
to save now this looks strange what are
they saving
well they're say what what are they
doing they're digging in the ground
they're going to plant trees or bushes
so they are trying to save the earth
so what are they doing they are
conserving
especially when we talk about protecting
the environment
or trying to save the earth we are
talking about conserving the earth
now you can also conserve other things
if you are careful with the electricity
you use in your house turn off the light
when you leave the room you want to
conserve
electricity if you want to conserve
water when you wash your hands don't run
the water the whole time
run the water get your hands wet turn it
off use soap
then turn it on again and wash the soap
off conserve
water save water save electricity
save the earth conservation project okay
conserve conserve
is the way we pronounce that eleven
what's that doesn't look very pretty but
it's very important
a black stone burned for heat
what do we call it we call it coal
c is a hard k sound
coal coal coal
is a black stone like we see in this
picture and we
burn it for heat uh if you go to uh
what do you say bulgogi or gogi jeep
bulgogi jeep you want to get bulgogi
or uh some places where they have the
the outside barbecue right they put coal
in the fire underneath and they burn it
right
and that's an example of coal you can
see it every day
right so blackstone burned for heat is
coal coal is very important for our
modern life
next one you don't worry about this
you're not driving
but when you get older you have to be
careful
look at the gas right because when you
become
when you when you use up
all the gas you use up all the gas
no more
then you have run out of gas
run out run out and the way to use it
run out of
momo run out of gas
run out of food run out of
water that means you used it all
up you used it now it's all gone
we can use up all the water we can use
up all the food
in your refrigerator we can use up all
the electricity
right that means we don't have any more
it's opseo
we run out okay number 13 to make
dirty imagine that this is not water
maybe this is some chemical that's
coming out of these pipes
into the stream it's making the stream
or the river
dirty what is it doing it's polluting
so when we
make the environment dirty we are
polluting
the environment and sometimes factories
or industrial places uh
industrial companies will pollute the
environment
because of what they're doing their
activities make
dirty water it makes dirty air or
it makes things that we throw away in
the ground
so dirty land if we make something dirty
we are polluting the environment pollute
pollute okay next one
fuel that was very fast fuel is very
energetic
isn't it so it jumps on the screen okay
something that produces
heat or power is fuel and
it's interesting to look at this picture
because you say well where's the fuel
it's not an engine he's using his legs
the fuel
is inside his body he ate breakfast
that morning the breakfast is the fuel
the food
that we eat helps us produce heat or
in this case power right when we put
gas in our car that's the fuel that
makes the
engine go it gives it power to the
engine
so fuel there's many kinds of fuel right
and this word of course is fuel okay
next one
a very peaceful picture very nice
picture looks like the
american west looks like where i'm from
okay a part of a place if we look at
this
very wide landscape very big what
very big area an area is a part
of a place right so the area in your
house
right that's an area your bedroom
is an area your kitchen is an area it's
part of a place okay wow this is very
exciting picture right this looks like
it's
downtown in a very large town
downtown in a very large town but what's
a very large town
a very large town we have a special word
for that
right if there's just a few people
living together just a few houses
we say that's a village
okay it's a village if a few more houses
a few more buildings we can say it's a
town
but more and more like this huge
buildings very tall buildings
millions of people living together we
say that
is a city so village town city
okay okay let's go over the vocabulary
here we have an interesting and exciting
a fun vocabulary exercise it's a puzzle
and this is a crossword puzzle that you
have in your book
we could say it's a crossword americans
say
cross word puzzle crossword
puzzle so our object
is to solve the puzzle we say it's
crossword because you have words that go
down
and you have words that go across
right and you have to fill in the boxes
with the letters
crossword one down and across
first we start with the cross the clues
for a cross now these are the words that
we're going to put
in the crossword puzzle there are eight
words
let's go over them first possible
possible require
require urban urban
industrial industrial
remains remains
form form process
process and replace
replace those are the words we need to
fit
into the cross word puzzle now
when you do a crossword puzzle usually
they give you the clues
for the words that are going across and
then in the next section
they give you clues for words that go
down
in the puzzle right down first we're
going to talk about
the words they're going across for these
clues we have
pictures okay so for number one we have
a picture
that is our clue this is a picture of a
city
now when we talk about the city setting
right what do we say i taught you two
words
right first i taught you in the city you
say it's
urban and in the countryside you say
it's a rural
but this is a city so this is the word
we need
urban and we can see u
r b a n one two three
four five one two three four five
that's an important point about
crossword puzzles
you have to fit the same number of
letters
the same number of letters
in the blank so you're looking for a
five
letter word that goes with this picture
let's see that in number three going
across
number three we have one two three four
a
four letter word that matches this
picture
remember we talked about this picture
when things come together
they do something right what do they do
they form something so they form a field
or they form a landscape to form
okay next one number seven
oh my gosh one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten a
ten letter word we're looking for a ten
letter word
that goes with this picture so which is
a ten letter word
that goes with this picture in this
picture we can see
this is the inside of a factory so
having to do with factories
remember the word we said that was
industrial
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten that's our ten letter word that
matches
the picture okay number eight
aha we're following a certain series of
steps
to cook something or you know to make
something it doesn't have to be cooking
it can be anything we need one two three
four five
six seven seven words where is a
seven letter word that me has to do with
this picture
one two three four five six seven aha
that's our word
it is process process
of course you can't just do the number
of words you have to make sure it
matches the picture right
a process is a series of steps that you
do
a series of actions or changes to do
something okay
that was the words that were across they
all had pictures now we're looking at
the words that go
down in the in the puzzle the words that
go
down the clues are part of a sentence
it's like
filling in the blank except in this case
the blank
is the box right the box is for each
letter of the word
what word makes sense in this sentence
babies
beep care and attention
babies need something right babies need
care and attention what's another word
for need that we talked about
would it be require one two three four
five six seven one two three four five
six seven
aha that fits and it makes sense
babies require care and attention
that's true so that's the correct answer
number four i gave the peep
of my lunch to the dog i gave the
what of my lunch to the dog well think
about that do you have a dog
when you eat food your dog looks at you
like this
right so after you finish eating maybe
you don't
eat everything so you give what's left
to your dog right what is left is
the what it's the remains you give the
remains of your lunch
maybe a piece of bread or maybe some
rice or
maybe a piece of apple dogs eat apples
right
so you give the remains of your lunch to
your dog
but don't do that actually because your
dog will beg you
every time you eat right so it's not
good to give the remains of your lunch
or dinner
to your dog give them their food
separately
okay next one number five down
new cars will peep the older cars
remember we talked about this you change
one thing for another if something's old
it doesn't work
you remove it and you put a new one in
its place
what are you doing you are replacing new
cars will
replace the older cars
so you will replace you will replace the
old one
with a new one replace new cars
to new cars will replace the older cars
they will replace
the older cars okay
number six it is beep
but not easy so when we talk about this
is a little bit more difficult right
you can do many things some things you
can do are very easy
but some things you can do are very hard
don't give up
even though it's very hard you can do it
it's what it's possible
it's possible but not easy
just because something is hard or not
easy doesn't mean it's not possible
right
many things in your life will be hard to
do but you can do it
it's possible it is possible to do
okay that wraps it up for the vocabulary
crossword puzzle it's kind of fun
putting a crossword puzzle together
isn't it but in every crossword puzzle
you have to find the clues across
and then down and you can mix them up
and of course remember pay attention to
the number of letters
in each box okay well let's take a short
break here
we'll come back soon and we'll go over
the reading passage together

00:34
our bodies so our topic our subject is
00:37
health right so that's what we'll be
00:39
talking about
00:40
in this lesson let's take a look here
00:43
first of all
00:44
what are fossil fuels there are many
00:48
kinds of fossil fuels in this video here
00:52
we can see these machines working
00:55
in a field or in a plane what are these
00:58
machines doing
01:00
they're getting oil from the ground
01:03
they're pumping
01:04
up oil from deep underground and
01:07
oil oil is
01:10
a fossil fuel we make gas
01:14
out of oil right
01:17
i think you say in korean kyung yoo
01:19
right uh
01:20
where you go to the juju so the gas
01:22
station and you get
01:24
fuel right so oil is made into gas
01:27
it's a type of fossil fuel also we'll
01:30
look at
01:31
other types of fossil fuels in this
01:34
lesson
01:35

02:55
all big cities any big city connected
02:58
with
02:59
a city connected with a city we say
03:03
urban urban so if you
03:06
live in a city you are living
03:09
in an urban setting you are living in an
03:13
urban setting but if you live on a
03:16

03:41
okay so rural is countryside urban is

having to do with factories so when we
03:51
say when we talk about
03:52
factories and factories that are making
03:54

04:07
adjective having to do with factories
04:12
this job is an industrial job
04:16
right uh this uh business deal is an
04:19
industrial business deal having to do
04:22
with
04:23
factories industrial
04:27
industrial industrial okay so the
04:30
pronunciation it's a long word
04:33
industry oh industrial
04:36
okay okay next one number five well this
04:39
is very interesting
04:40
what is this if we look closely
04:44
this is rock right it's part it's a
04:46
piece of rock
04:47
but there's some strange oh it looks
04:50
kind of scary it's a spider
04:52
right it's a spider that died a long
04:54
long
04:56
time ago and a long time ago this
04:59
rock was mud it was soft and the
05:02
spider's body
05:03
laid there and got covered with mud and
05:05
got pressed and because of the pressure
05:08
it turned into rock so that all that is
05:11
left
05:11
of the spider is this form or the
05:15
shape in the rock it's all that
05:18
remains all that remains the remains of
05:22
the spider

05:39
from that thing that died a long time

09:54
burn it for heat uh if you go to uh
09:58
what do you say bulgogi or gogi jeep
10:00
bulgogi jeep you want to get bulgogi
10:03
or uh some places where they have the
10:06
the outside barbecue right they put coal
10:10
in the fire underneath and they burn it
10:13
right
10:13
and that's an example of coal you can
10:15
see it every day
10:16
right so blackstone burned for heat is
10:20
coal coal is very important for our
10:23
modern life
10:25
next one you don't worry about this
10:28
you're not driving
10:30
but when you get older you have to be
10:32
careful
10:33
look at the gas right because when you
10:35
become
10:36
when you when you use up
10:39
all the gas you use up all the gas
10:43
no more
10:46
then you have run out of gas
10:50
run out run out and the way to use it
10:53
run out of
10:58
momo run out of gas
11:01
run out of food run out of
11:04
water that means you used it all
11:07
up you used it now it's all gone
11:10
we can use up all the water we can use
11:13
up all the food
11:14
in your refrigerator we can use up all
11:16
the electricity
11:17
right that means we don't have any more
11:20
it's opseo
11:22
we run out okay number 13 to make
11:26
dirty imagine that this is not water
11:29
maybe this is some chemical that's
11:31
coming out of these pipes
11:33
into the stream it's making the stream
11:36
or the river
11:37
dirty what is it doing it's polluting
11:40
so when we
11:43
make the environment dirty we are
11:46
polluting
11:47
the environment and sometimes factories
11:50
or industrial places uh
11:54
industrial companies will pollute the
11:57
environment
11:58
because of what they're doing their
12:00
activities make
12:01
dirty water it makes dirty air or
12:04
it makes things that we throw away in
12:06
the ground
12:07
so dirty land if we make something dirty
12:11
we are polluting the environment pollute
12:15
pollute okay next one
12:19
fuel that was very fast fuel is very
12:22
energetic
12:22
isn't it so it jumps on the screen okay
12:25
something that produces
12:26
heat or power is fuel and
12:30
it's interesting to look at this picture
12:32
because you say well where's the fuel
12:34
it's not an engine he's using his legs
12:37
the fuel
12:38
is inside his body he ate breakfast
12:41
that morning the breakfast is the fuel
12:44
the food
12:45
that we eat helps us produce heat or
12:48
in this case power right when we put
12:51
gas in our car that's the fuel that
12:54
makes the
12:55
engine go it gives it power to the
12:57
engine
12:58
so fuel there's many kinds of fuel right
13:02
and this word of course is fuel okay

18:48
the words that go
18:49
down in the in the puzzle the words that
18:52
go
18:52
down the clues are part of a sentence
18:55
it's like
18:56
filling in the blank except in this case
18:58
the blank
18:59
is the box right the box is for each
19:02
letter of the word
19:04
what word makes sense in this sentence
19:06
babies
19:07
beep care and attention
19:11
babies need something right babies need
19:14
care and attention what's another word
19:16
for need that we talked about
19:18
would it be require one two three four
19:22
five six seven one two three four five
19:25
six seven
19:26
aha that fits and it makes sense
19:30
babies require care and attention
19:33
that's true so that's the correct answer
19:36
number four i gave the peep
19:40
of my lunch to the dog i gave the
19:43
what of my lunch to the dog well think
19:46
about that do you have a dog
19:48
when you eat food your dog looks at you
19:51
like this
19:52
right so after you finish eating maybe
19:55
you don't
19:56
eat everything so you give what's left
20:00
to your dog right what is left is
20:03
the what it's the remains you give the
20:06
remains of your lunch
20:08
maybe a piece of bread or maybe some
20:10
rice or
20:11
maybe a piece of apple dogs eat apples
20:14
right
20:14
so you give the remains of your lunch to
20:17
your dog
20:18
but don't do that actually because your
20:20
dog will beg you
20:22
every time you eat right so it's not
20:24
good to give the remains of your lunch
20:26
or dinner
20:27
to your dog give them their food
20:29
separately
20:30
okay next one number five down
20:34
new cars will peep the older cars
20:37
remember we talked about this you change
20:41
one thing for another if something's old
20:43
it doesn't work
20:44
you remove it and you put a new one in
20:47
its place
20:48
what are you doing you are replacing new
20:51
cars will
20:52
replace the older cars
20:55
so you will replace you will replace the
20:58
old one
20:59
with a new one replace new cars
21:03
to new cars will replace the older cars
21:06
they will replace
21:07
the older cars okay
21:10
number six it is beep
21:14
but not easy so when we talk about this
21:16
is a little bit more difficult right
21:20
you can do many things some things you
21:22
can do are very easy
21:23
but some things you can do are very hard
21:26
don't give up
21:27
even though it's very hard you can do it
21:30
it's what it's possible
21:34
it's possible but not easy
21:38
just because something is hard or not
21:41
easy doesn't mean it's not possible
21:44
right
21:45
many things in your life will be hard to
21:47
do but you can do it
21:49
it's possible it is possible to do
21:53
