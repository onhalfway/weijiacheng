hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
we're taking a look at social studies
book 3
lesson 13 and lesson 13 is about
weather and climate
are you cold or are you hot okay
in this unit you will discover what
climates are
and we'll also talk about different
climates
in the united states so let's take a
look
as usual we start with the vocabulary
and our first word very appropriate is
climate right we just use that word it's
a little bit of a difficult word isn't
it
but climate just means the weather
in an area over a long period of time
so you might think well what's the
difference between climate
and weather climate when you think about
climate you're thinking about a very
long
time period when you're thinking about
the weather it could just be today
if it's raining today the weather today
we're talking about the weather today
it's raining
but maybe it doesn't rain every day of
the year
maybe you live in a desert and it only
rains
three days a year so the weather might
be rainy today
but the climate for the desert is dry
and hot
no rain or very little rain so that is
the difference between
climate and weather climate is a very
long
uh range or long period of time
what is the weather like over a long
period of time
weather is just you know you're talking
about it very short you know today
tomorrow next week what will the weather
be like so climate is a long period
weather is a short period okay so the
weather in an area
over a long period of time
what is the climate like in your country
what is the typical weather
like in your country okay
next we have weather report and on
television you can see people
meteorologists
remember we talked about meteorologists
in a previous lesson
meteorologist meteor is from greek it
means weather right
people who study the weather weather
report
is a report that predicts the weather
conditions
so you see a meteorologist on television
and she's talking about you know friday
it will be partly cloudy
saturday there will be a few showers a
little bit of rain
but sunday it'll be sunny so uh
the weekend isn't completely ruined at
least you can enjoy
the outdoors on sunday okay but probably
it's thursday today
and she's giving us the weather report
what will the weather be
like in the near future tomorrow the
next day the day after that
and maybe next week it's very hard to
predict weather
uh very long for a very long period in
the future for example
after one week the weather report
usually isn't very
accurate it's very difficult to predict
the weather
one week from now okay but within a week
we can get pretty accurate weather
reports
okay storm a storm is a type of weather
condition and it's very bad weather with
strong winds
rain lightning lightning that's
electricity
coming out of this clouds zeus is very
angry no of course
that's the old greek god right the god
of
lightning thunder and lightning but
lightning is the flash of light that you
see
it's electricity in the air and thunder
thunder is a really loud sound you hear
after you see
the flash of light lightning and thunder
okay thunder and lightning okay so
that's a storm
very bad weather
and we have a picture of a storm now
like i said
a storm and we can see that there are
very high
winds they're very high winds and if
you're at the ocean or you're at the
beach
those winds will cause the waves to be
very large
so during a storm it's a good idea to
stay away from the beach right stay away
from don't play in the water
because the water is going to be very
strong
but the storm pushes the winds the winds
push the water
and that makes very big waves and of
course a lot of rain will come
they'll see some lightning and hear some
thunder okay
next we have lightning as i said before
lightning is a sudden bright light
caused by electricity in the sky
electricity in the sky who turned on the
light switch
no of course there's no light switch
it's just electric power of course is
caused by
a different charged particles in the
atmosphere interacting with the ground
right and that the energy in the clouds
wants to uh release itself and go into
the ground where there's less energy
so it will form lightning electricity
will form out of
thin air and just come down and maybe
hit the ground
you don't want to be on the ground where
the lightning hits
and that's why many buildings have a
metal pole because that will attract the
lightning
we call those lightning rods a lightning
rod
is a metal pole on top of a building
so the lightning will hit the pole and
not hit the people walking around the
street
so lightning rods are are important to
protect
people and buildings right the metal can
absorb the electricity
and the heat and it won't burn so that's
it's better that the lightning hits the
lightning rod then it hits you
or your house made of wood and
burns so lightning rods so sudden bright
light
caused by electricity in the sky
next electricity what is electricity as
you know electricity is a form of
energy that gives power to machines
and lights right we have lots of lights
you have lots of lights in your house
right
you use your computer you turn it on
that means you supply electricity to
your computer
without electricity your computer won't
work your phone won't work
a lot of devices that you have will not
work without
electricity next
we have fit now fit has a lot of
different meanings
but in this case fit means that it's
good enough
for something it's fit if you say i am
fit
right that means you're healthy i am fit
you're healthy you're good well you're
always good enough for something you're
always good
but fit in this case this one i am fit
means i am healthy
right uh strong
right capable fit also means
that if you put on a shirt or a coat
it fits you well right it fits it's not
too big
it's not too small it's fit it fits you
it's good enough for you okay so that's
what that means there
okay the last word is chance and chance
what is chance chance is a possibility
that something might happen and we can
have small chances
or large chances chance just you know
we don't know what the future will hold
the future has many possibilities
and we can choose those possibilities in
most cases
this is a good picture because it shows
the different possibilities for your
future right
maybe this one you will open now like i
said there are big chances and small
chances now i don't want to discourage
anybody but what is the chance that you
might become a famous singer
right it's a small chance i'm sorry but
you have to work hard you have to
put a lot of effort to become a famous
singer not many people become
famous singers or athletes the chance
for doing that is very small
but what's the chance of you growing up
and being a father or a mother
the chance is a lot larger because
that's very common
many people do that and it's just kind
of a normal
thing to do in life so the chance of
being a mother father
is very big the chance of becoming a
famous person like a musician
or an athlete is very small so we have
big chances and small chances small
chances and large
chances they're just possibilities that
something might happen
okay those are our words for today
okay let's talk about the two main ideas
in this lesson
the first idea is about different
climates
in different parts of the united states
up on the top here you can see we have a
map
and the first box it says california and
in the second box it says
maine the map is a little small so let's
just very quickly
move on in there and zoom in and you can
see that this is
the united states of america there are
many many states here there are 50
states in america but not all 50 states
are here
hawaii and alaska are not shown on this
map
they're in different places but anyway
california you can see is over here it's
on the west coast
this is the west coast of america and
maine maine is up here look how far
north that is
that's really far north what happens
when you move north
it gets colder right so california
and maine have very different climates
californians on the west coast and
actually it's
southern it's a little bit southern and
maine is
way up here it's north so the climates
of both states are very different and
actually i want to put a little bit more
detail in here
when you look at california you see how
long the state is it's really long
actually there's a different climate in
northern california than in
southern california in northern
california it's very rainy
in southern california it's very it's
drier
it's much warmer and not as much rain
so zooming back out we see california
what is the climate like
warm and dry in the summer so that's
true
warm and dry in the summer especially
for southern california
and what do people need in this climate
well they need cool air in buildings
sure
because in southern california
especially in the summertime
it gets hot so people need air
conditioning
cool air in buildings they should also
wear
light clothes like clothes a t-shirt
probably shorts nothing heavy it'd be
very hot to be running around in la
in august in a full suit that's too hot
right
of course you don't go to work in a
t-shirt and shorts but
light clothes would be more appropriate
and of course
umbrellas umbrellas more you need
umbrellas more often in northern
california
where it rains a lot it rains almost
every day
in northern california okay so a little
bit different climates
just even in the state of california but
these climates are much different from
maine
in maine it's very cold and snowy in the
winter
it it doesn't really snow in los angeles
hardly at all and
it probably doesn't snow at all during
the whole year it would be very rare
sure it could happen but it's very rare
if it does happen
but in maine it snows a lot in the
winter it's
not rare at all they get a lot of snow
they get
you know several feet of snow so it's
very cold and snowy in the winter
and of course it's very far north in
fact
you know it's interesting about maine
maine is further north
than some parts of canada many people in
canada live close to the united states
so the people who live in maine are
actually living farther north
than many people in canada okay so
that's very interesting
so it's very cold in the winter and in
the winter you need
warm air in buildings heaters central
heating
you also need warm clothes you know
thick jackets and probably
many clothes layers like thermal
underwear then a shirt
and then maybe a light jacket or a
sweater and then a heavy jacket on top
of that
right and you also need gloves to
protect your hands
and you need a hat to protect your head
a lot of your body heat
escapes from your head so make sure if
you're in cold
weather wear a hat keep that heat in so
of course
as we see in the bottom here climate
makes a difference
in the way people live of course
the weather outside the temperature
outside will affect
how you live will you go outside and
play in the swimming pool
or will you go outside in a lot of
clothes and make a snowman
okay the location of a place affects the
climate and the weather
we know that the further south you are
the warmer
it is generally and the further north
you go
the colder it is generally most of the
time
but as you can see america is a big
country so it's very difficult
when some you know an american goes to
another country and the people say
what's the weather like in america well
it depends
where are you from so it's a very
difficult question to ask
to answer i'm sorry it's a very
difficult question to answer
it all depends on where the american is
from if the american is from california
the weather is warm dry southern
california
a warm dry hot in the summer if the
american is from maine
it's cold cool in the summer but very
cold in the winter
okay so america has a lot of different
climates okay
okay well it's good to look at climates
in terms of states
california and maine but it's also
important to look at
specific areas of the united states and
take a look at the climate in these
areas for example states can be very big
in the united states and
they can have different weather patterns
as i mentioned northern california and
southern california
have different weather so the weather in
san francisco
will be much different than the weather
in los angeles for example
well let's take a look around the united
states at different cities
and talk about the weather or the
climates
in these cities here in this page we
have chicago
miami washington dc and
seattle what are the climates
like in these cities well let's start
with chicago
now chicago it's it says three things
mild hot summers cold winters
but that's kind of a contradiction
because
mild i mean sure it's mild in the spring
and the fall
in other words mild weather would be not
too hot not too
cold so sure it would be mild in the
spring
and in the fall it's not too hot it's
probably perfect weather
in the spring and the fall but in the
summertime it gets really
hot and it's humid in chicago too
chicago is right on the on the on a lake
one of the big
one of the great lakes between america
and canada
and lake michigan chicago is right on
lake michigan so they get a lot of
moisture
from the lake and so it becomes humid
and hot
in the summertime in the winter however
it gets really cold chicago is north
it's
it's in the northern part not the
absolute northern part but it's a more
northern city in the united states
and it gets very cold in the winter and
there's a lot of snow
so the the climate really goes from one
extreme
to the other extreme from summer to
winter
and sure it might be mild in the spring
and the fall
now miami is one of the i don't know if
it's the
southernmost i think it might be the
southernmost the most
southern city in the continental
united states so on the continent the
the all the states that are all together
i think miami is the southern most large
city so obviously in the south it's very
hot and it's actually
a little tropical in miami of course
a lot of florida has is is jungle so
it's a tropical-like
environment so of course miami will be
hot
it says dry summers i don't agree with
that my brother lives in
in florida and in the summertime it's
very humid
it's uncomfortably humid you go outside
in a t-shirt and shorts and you start
sweating
immediately because it's so hot and
humid
in florida so it's very hot summers
and it's very rainy also in their rainy
season
of course they're mild they have mild
winters mild again means not severe or
not extreme
so many people who live in the northern
parts of the united states especially in
the north
on the east coast will move down to
florida
and miami for the winter time because
they don't like
snow so we call these people snow
birds a snow bird because they're like
the birds that fly
south for the winter and then when the
winter is over
they fly back to the north to enjoy the
nice
cooler summers because of course in
miami
it's too hot and too humid in the
summertime it's it's
terrible if you don't have air
conditioning it's really
very difficult to be outside okay
washington dc washington dc is on the
east coast it's in the middle
it's kind of in the middle part of the
east coast
however even though it's in the middle
part it's still hot in the summertime
and they have a lot of rain it says wet
summers but they
mild winters yeah depends on your
definition of mild
washington dc can still get cold and
they do get snow
sometimes they get big snowstorms maybe
not
as bad as in chicago
or more northern states like we talked
about in maine
but they still do get kind of cold in
the winter time
so again washington dc and chicago kind
of the same
hot humid summers cold winters but
chicago is probably
colder in the winters now seattle is our
last
city that we're taking a look at on this
page and uh where
chicago miami and washington dc are more
eastern states
seattle is all the way on the west coast
but it's northern west coast it's in the
pacific
northwest and this picture is not a very
good
representative picture of seattle and
the reason i say that
is because the picture shows beautiful
clear
blue skies now of course i'm sure that
there are beautiful clear skies in
seattle
a lot of the time but a lot of the time
most of the time it's rainy in seattle
seattle gets a lot of rain
it says it's mild year-round okay it's
mild that means it doesn't get too hot
it doesn't get too cold that's true it
doesn't really snow that much in seattle
and on the other hand in the summertime
it doesn't really get that hot
but it's right on the coast and it gets
a lot of moisture that
comes in off the pacific ocean and it
rains
almost every day there's a there was a
tv show i was watching
the tv show was set in seattle on every
episode of that tv show
it was raining it was like wow this city
really rains a lot
and i've been there a couple of times
and it does rain a lot of course
that makes a lot of nice trees a lot of
nice greenery
a very lush environment lots of trees
lots of grass lots of bushes
so it's very green in the pacific
northwest and seattle
is very is a very green city but it gets
a lot of rain
so as we were talking about the united
states is a very big country
there are many different climate zones
in the country whether you're going from
north to south or even from east to west
you also have different climate regions
some regions are
wet get a lot of rain some regions are
very dry they're desert
some regions in the north are very cold
in the winter and some regions in the
south
don't get any snow at all so it's very
difficult you know if you meet somebody
from america
don't say well what's the weather like
in america because you know what are
they going to say it depends on where
they're from
so of course you know keep that in mind
right the weather might be very
different for someone from who
for someone who's from miami as opposed
to someone who's from chicago
or seattle so of course there's lots of
different climates
in the united states how about your
country what is the climate there
if you live in a large country maybe you
have many different climates as well
if you live in a smaller country maybe
it's an easy
question to ask or to answer you know
what's the weather like in your country
okay well let's move on okay let's do
the reading passage together and of
course we're talking about weather and
climate
so as i read along please repeat after
me
or if that's not a good idea repeat
along in your mind
if you're in a crowded place and focus
on the vocabulary
in the lesson and also see if you can
pick up any new words
okay are you guys ready let's begin
the weather has a big effect on our
daily lives
climate is the weather of a place
over a long time it makes a difference
in the way people live
the climates of some states are usually
warm all year round
but to know more about the changing
weather
we should watch the weather report
for example the weather report says
that tomorrow there will be a storm
and lightning activity on the west
coast of the u.s
lightning means there is a lot of
electricity
in the air so we should stay at home
because it is dangerous outside
the weather report also says
there is a chance of snow in maine
a snowy day is fit for making
snowmen children in maine
will wear warm clothes and have fun
outside that's true if there's a lot of
snow
in the area that you live in you know
it's not you don't don't stay at home
all day right go out have fun in the
snow have a snowball fight
right make a snowman go sledding there's
many outdoor activities you can do
in the winter and enjoy the snow okay
so how is this information organized in
the reading passage
in this case we have cause and effect
right cause
is an action or something that happens
and then the result of that action is
the effect right so you have a cause
action and then a result or effect so
cause and effect the cause is on the
left hand side and the effect is on the
right hand side
we have two we have one cause one effect
second cause second effect let's take a
look
okay so first one the weather report
says that there will be a peep
and lightning activity a
what lightning activity in the reading
passage it says
the weather report says that there will
be a storm
and lightning activity so a storm of
course you know
could be rain could be snow a snow storm
rain rainstorm thunderstorm there's a
lot of ways we describe storm but in
this case
it's just storm we don't have to put a
storm we don't have to put rain it just
said storm
so the weather report says there will be
a storm and lightning activity so
what is the effect of that what is the
result well in this case it's advice
right we should should means advice so
what is the result of that
prediction of that weather forecast
well the effect of that is advice it's
we should
what beep at home what should you do at
home you should
stay at home stay inside so we should
stay
at home okay that's the first cause in
fact
second cause and effect the weather
report says
that there is a beep of snow in maine
so this is very common for weather
reports right
it's very difficult to predict the
future
it's very and many people don't want to
say there will be a 100 percent
chance of something right so they will
make it smaller
and it's very common people say there is
instead of you know
an 80 chance 60 chance 40
chance sometimes people just say there
is a
chance of so there is a chance of and
that's a very common thing
to say especially for weather reports
oops i put change
i meant change that g to a c
yeah that's when you're writing and
talking at the same time right
so chance chance c e not ge
chance ge's change right but we we want
chance
the weather report says that there is a
chance
of snow in maine by the way when
somebody says there is a chance of
something
that usually implies that there is a
small
chance right if you say there's a chance
of snow
it means it could happen but it's
not likely if people want to make it
stronger they will say
there is a huge chance that in that case
that's like 80 percent
chance of snow there's a huge chance of
snow
in maine but if you just say there's a
chance of snow that's a small
chance right that's a little chance
maybe thirty percent
twenty percent chance of snow so it's
not likely
okay the weather report says there is a
chance of snow in maine
so the effect of that children in maine
will wear
beep clothes and have fun outside of
course if it does snow
if it does snow children in maine will
wear what kind of clothes
light clothes no they will wear
heavy clothes warm clothes they will
wear
warm clothes and of course you can also
say
heavy clothes or winter clothes
you could also say summer or light
clothes on the opposite
side okay so children in maine will wear
warm clothes
and have fun outside which is great go
make a snowman
have a snowball fight but be careful
with a snowball fight you know don't hit
anybody in the head
right aim for their bodies but that can
be fun too and of course sledding as
well
that's also a fun activity okay so that
wraps up
this lesson for today in this lesson we
took a look at climate especially in the
united states
and we saw that there are many different
uh types
of climate lots of different uh
areas or environments in which people
live and of course
climate we're talking about uh the
difference between climate and weather
climate is the long-term or
the weather patterns that exist for a
long time
in a certain area weather is just what's
happening today
right or what will happen tomorrow or
next week
weather is just a short time when you're
looking at
the weather conditions climate is a
long-term
look at weather conditions okay so
what's the weather like in your country
i asked you that before
it's a good thing to think about how can
you describe it i hope that after this
lesson
you will be able to describe your
weather to somebody else
in english if they ask you okay so
that's it for this lesson
hope to see in the next one take care
everybody bye bye

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading
00:12
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
00:14
we're taking a look at social studies
00:15
book 3
00:17
lesson 13 and lesson 13 is about
00:21
weather and climate
00:24
are you cold or are you hot okay
00:27
in this unit you will discover what
00:29
climates are
00:31
and we'll also talk about different
00:33
climates
00:34
in the united states so let's take a
00:37
look
00:41
as usual we start with the vocabulary
00:44
and our first word very appropriate is
00:48
climate right we just use that word it's
00:51
a little bit of a difficult word isn't
00:53
it
00:53
but climate just means the weather
00:57
in an area over a long period of time
01:02
so you might think well what's the
01:03
difference between climate
01:05
and weather climate when you think about
01:09
climate you're thinking about a very
01:10
long
01:11
time period when you're thinking about
01:13
the weather it could just be today
01:15
if it's raining today the weather today
01:17
we're talking about the weather today
01:19
it's raining
01:20
but maybe it doesn't rain every day of
01:22
the year
01:23
maybe you live in a desert and it only
01:27
rains
01:28
three days a year so the weather might
01:31
be rainy today
01:32
but the climate for the desert is dry
01:35
and hot
01:36
no rain or very little rain so that is
01:39
the difference between
01:40
climate and weather climate is a very
01:43
long
01:44
uh range or long period of time
01:47
what is the weather like over a long
01:49
period of time
01:50
weather is just you know you're talking
01:52
about it very short you know today
01:54
tomorrow next week what will the weather
01:56
be like so climate is a long period
01:58
weather is a short period okay so the
02:01
weather in an area
02:02
over a long period of time
02:05
what is the climate like in your country
02:08
what is the typical weather
02:10
like in your country okay
02:13
next we have weather report and on
02:16
television you can see people
02:19
meteorologists
02:21
remember we talked about meteorologists
02:22
in a previous lesson
02:24
meteorologist meteor is from greek it
02:26
means weather right
02:27
people who study the weather weather
02:30
report
02:31
is a report that predicts the weather
02:33
conditions
02:34
so you see a meteorologist on television
02:37
and she's talking about you know friday
02:40
it will be partly cloudy
02:41
saturday there will be a few showers a
02:44
little bit of rain
02:45
but sunday it'll be sunny so uh
02:48
the weekend isn't completely ruined at
02:51
least you can enjoy
02:52
the outdoors on sunday okay but probably
02:55
it's thursday today
02:57
and she's giving us the weather report
03:00
what will the weather be
03:01
like in the near future tomorrow the
03:04
next day the day after that
03:05
and maybe next week it's very hard to
03:08
predict weather
03:09
uh very long for a very long period in
03:12
the future for example
03:13
after one week the weather report
03:16
usually isn't very
03:18
accurate it's very difficult to predict
03:21
the weather
03:22
one week from now okay but within a week
03:26
we can get pretty accurate weather
03:28
reports
03:29
okay storm a storm is a type of weather
03:34
condition and it's very bad weather with
03:37
strong winds
03:38
rain lightning lightning that's
03:40
electricity
03:41
coming out of this clouds zeus is very
03:44
angry no of course
03:45
that's the old greek god right the god
03:48
of
03:48
lightning thunder and lightning but
03:50
lightning is the flash of light that you
03:52
see
03:52
it's electricity in the air and thunder
03:56
thunder is a really loud sound you hear
03:59
after you see
04:00
the flash of light lightning and thunder
04:04
okay thunder and lightning okay so
04:06
that's a storm
04:07
very bad weather
04:11
and we have a picture of a storm now
04:13
like i said
04:14
a storm and we can see that there are
04:16
very high
04:17
winds they're very high winds and if
04:20
you're at the ocean or you're at the
04:22
beach
04:22
those winds will cause the waves to be
04:25
very large
04:26
so during a storm it's a good idea to
04:30
stay away from the beach right stay away
04:32
from don't play in the water
04:34
because the water is going to be very
04:36
strong
04:37
but the storm pushes the winds the winds
04:39
push the water
04:40
and that makes very big waves and of
04:43
course a lot of rain will come
04:44
they'll see some lightning and hear some
04:47
thunder okay
04:49
next we have lightning as i said before
04:51
lightning is a sudden bright light
04:53
caused by electricity in the sky
04:57
electricity in the sky who turned on the
05:00
light switch
05:01
no of course there's no light switch
05:02
it's just electric power of course is
05:04
caused by
05:05
a different charged particles in the
05:07
atmosphere interacting with the ground
05:10
right and that the energy in the clouds
05:13
wants to uh release itself and go into
05:16
the ground where there's less energy
05:18
so it will form lightning electricity
05:20
will form out of
05:22
thin air and just come down and maybe
05:25
hit the ground
05:26
you don't want to be on the ground where
05:28
the lightning hits
05:29
and that's why many buildings have a
05:31
metal pole because that will attract the
05:33
lightning
05:34
we call those lightning rods a lightning
05:37
rod
05:38
is a metal pole on top of a building
05:41
so the lightning will hit the pole and
05:43
not hit the people walking around the
05:45
street
05:46
so lightning rods are are important to
05:48
protect
05:49
people and buildings right the metal can
05:52
absorb the electricity
05:53
and the heat and it won't burn so that's
05:56
it's better that the lightning hits the
05:58
lightning rod then it hits you
06:00
or your house made of wood and
06:03
burns so lightning rods so sudden bright
06:06
light
06:06
caused by electricity in the sky
06:10
next electricity what is electricity as
06:14
you know electricity is a form of
06:16
energy that gives power to machines
06:19
and lights right we have lots of lights
06:21
you have lots of lights in your house
06:23
right
06:23
you use your computer you turn it on
06:26
that means you supply electricity to
06:28
your computer
06:29
without electricity your computer won't
06:31
work your phone won't work
06:33
a lot of devices that you have will not
06:36
work without
06:37
electricity next
06:40
we have fit now fit has a lot of
06:42
different meanings
06:44
but in this case fit means that it's
06:46
good enough
06:47
for something it's fit if you say i am
06:50
fit
06:51
right that means you're healthy i am fit
06:55
you're healthy you're good well you're
06:57
always good enough for something you're
06:58
always good
07:00
but fit in this case this one i am fit
07:03
means i am healthy
07:04
right uh strong
07:07
right capable fit also means
07:10
that if you put on a shirt or a coat
07:14
it fits you well right it fits it's not
07:16
too big
07:17
it's not too small it's fit it fits you
07:20
it's good enough for you okay so that's
07:23
what that means there
07:26
okay the last word is chance and chance
07:29
what is chance chance is a possibility
07:31
that something might happen and we can
07:33
have small chances
07:35
or large chances chance just you know
07:38
we don't know what the future will hold
07:41
the future has many possibilities
07:43
and we can choose those possibilities in
07:46
most cases
07:47
this is a good picture because it shows
07:49
the different possibilities for your
07:51
future right
07:52
maybe this one you will open now like i
07:54
said there are big chances and small
07:56
chances now i don't want to discourage
07:58
anybody but what is the chance that you
08:00
might become a famous singer
08:02
right it's a small chance i'm sorry but
08:05
you have to work hard you have to
08:07
put a lot of effort to become a famous
08:09
singer not many people become
08:11
famous singers or athletes the chance
08:14
for doing that is very small
08:17
but what's the chance of you growing up
08:19
and being a father or a mother
08:21
the chance is a lot larger because
08:24
that's very common
08:25
many people do that and it's just kind
08:27
of a normal
08:28
thing to do in life so the chance of
08:31
being a mother father
08:32
is very big the chance of becoming a
08:34
famous person like a musician
08:36
or an athlete is very small so we have
08:40
big chances and small chances small
08:43
chances and large
08:44
chances they're just possibilities that
08:46
something might happen
08:48
okay those are our words for today
08:51
okay let's talk about the two main ideas
08:54
in this lesson
08:55
the first idea is about different
08:57
climates
08:58
in different parts of the united states
09:01
up on the top here you can see we have a
09:04
map
09:04
and the first box it says california and
09:07
in the second box it says
09:09
maine the map is a little small so let's
09:12
just very quickly
09:14
move on in there and zoom in and you can
09:16
see that this is
09:18
the united states of america there are
09:20
many many states here there are 50
09:22
states in america but not all 50 states
09:25
are here
09:26
hawaii and alaska are not shown on this
09:28
map
09:29
they're in different places but anyway
09:32
california you can see is over here it's
09:34
on the west coast
09:35
this is the west coast of america and
09:39
maine maine is up here look how far
09:41
north that is
09:43
that's really far north what happens
09:45
when you move north
09:46
it gets colder right so california
09:50
and maine have very different climates
09:53
californians on the west coast and
09:55
actually it's
09:56
southern it's a little bit southern and
09:58
maine is
09:59
way up here it's north so the climates
10:03
of both states are very different and
10:05
actually i want to put a little bit more
10:06
detail in here
10:07
when you look at california you see how
10:10
long the state is it's really long
10:13
actually there's a different climate in
10:16
northern california than in
10:18
southern california in northern
10:20
california it's very rainy
10:23
in southern california it's very it's
10:26
drier
10:27
it's much warmer and not as much rain
10:30
so zooming back out we see california
10:33
what is the climate like
10:35
warm and dry in the summer so that's
10:38
true
10:38
warm and dry in the summer especially
10:40
for southern california
10:42
and what do people need in this climate
10:46
well they need cool air in buildings
10:48
sure
10:49
because in southern california
10:51
especially in the summertime
10:52
it gets hot so people need air
10:55
conditioning
10:56
cool air in buildings they should also
11:00
wear
11:00
light clothes like clothes a t-shirt
11:04
probably shorts nothing heavy it'd be
11:07
very hot to be running around in la
11:10
in august in a full suit that's too hot
11:13
right
11:14
of course you don't go to work in a
11:15
t-shirt and shorts but
11:17
light clothes would be more appropriate
11:20
and of course
11:21
umbrellas umbrellas more you need
11:24
umbrellas more often in northern
11:26
california
11:27
where it rains a lot it rains almost
11:29
every day
11:30
in northern california okay so a little
11:34
bit different climates
11:35
just even in the state of california but
11:37
these climates are much different from
11:39
maine
11:40
in maine it's very cold and snowy in the
11:44
winter
11:44
it it doesn't really snow in los angeles
11:47
hardly at all and
11:48
it probably doesn't snow at all during
11:50
the whole year it would be very rare
11:53
sure it could happen but it's very rare
11:55
if it does happen
11:56
but in maine it snows a lot in the
11:59
winter it's
12:00
not rare at all they get a lot of snow
12:03
they get
12:03
you know several feet of snow so it's
12:06
very cold and snowy in the winter
12:09
and of course it's very far north in
12:11
fact
12:12
you know it's interesting about maine
12:13
maine is further north
12:15
than some parts of canada many people in
12:19
canada live close to the united states
12:21
so the people who live in maine are
12:23
actually living farther north
12:25
than many people in canada okay so
12:28
that's very interesting
12:29
so it's very cold in the winter and in
12:31
the winter you need
12:32
warm air in buildings heaters central
12:35
heating
12:36
you also need warm clothes you know
12:39
thick jackets and probably
12:41
many clothes layers like thermal
12:43
underwear then a shirt
12:44
and then maybe a light jacket or a
12:46
sweater and then a heavy jacket on top
12:48
of that
12:49
right and you also need gloves to
12:51
protect your hands
12:52
and you need a hat to protect your head
12:55
a lot of your body heat
12:57
escapes from your head so make sure if
12:59
you're in cold
13:00
weather wear a hat keep that heat in so
13:03
of course
13:04
as we see in the bottom here climate
13:06
makes a difference
13:07
in the way people live of course
13:11
the weather outside the temperature
13:13
outside will affect
13:14
how you live will you go outside and
13:17
play in the swimming pool
13:18
or will you go outside in a lot of
13:20
clothes and make a snowman
13:22
okay the location of a place affects the
13:25
climate and the weather
13:27
we know that the further south you are
13:29
the warmer
13:30
it is generally and the further north
13:33
you go
13:33
the colder it is generally most of the
13:36
time
13:37
but as you can see america is a big
13:38
country so it's very difficult
13:41
when some you know an american goes to
13:43
another country and the people say
13:45
what's the weather like in america well
13:47
it depends
13:48
where are you from so it's a very
13:50
difficult question to ask
13:53
to answer i'm sorry it's a very
13:54
difficult question to answer
13:56
it all depends on where the american is
13:58
from if the american is from california
14:01
the weather is warm dry southern
14:04
california
14:04
a warm dry hot in the summer if the
14:07
american is from maine
14:08
it's cold cool in the summer but very
14:11
cold in the winter
14:12
okay so america has a lot of different
14:14
climates okay
14:17
okay well it's good to look at climates
14:20
in terms of states
14:21
california and maine but it's also
14:23
important to look at
14:25
specific areas of the united states and
14:28
take a look at the climate in these
14:30
areas for example states can be very big
14:32
in the united states and
14:33
they can have different weather patterns
14:35
as i mentioned northern california and
14:37
southern california
14:39
have different weather so the weather in
14:41
san francisco
14:42
will be much different than the weather
14:44
in los angeles for example
14:46
well let's take a look around the united
14:48
states at different cities
14:50
and talk about the weather or the
14:52
climates
14:53
in these cities here in this page we
14:56
have chicago
14:57
miami washington dc and
15:01
seattle what are the climates
15:04
like in these cities well let's start
15:07
with chicago
15:08
now chicago it's it says three things
15:12
mild hot summers cold winters
15:15
but that's kind of a contradiction
15:18
because
15:19
mild i mean sure it's mild in the spring
15:21
and the fall
15:22
in other words mild weather would be not
15:25
too hot not too
15:26
cold so sure it would be mild in the
15:28
spring
15:29
and in the fall it's not too hot it's
15:31
probably perfect weather
15:33
in the spring and the fall but in the
15:36
summertime it gets really
15:38
hot and it's humid in chicago too
15:41
chicago is right on the on the on a lake
15:44
one of the big
15:45
one of the great lakes between america
15:47
and canada
15:49
and lake michigan chicago is right on
15:51
lake michigan so they get a lot of
15:53
moisture
15:54
from the lake and so it becomes humid
15:56
and hot
15:57
in the summertime in the winter however
16:00
it gets really cold chicago is north
16:03
it's
16:04
it's in the northern part not the
16:06
absolute northern part but it's a more
16:08
northern city in the united states
16:11
and it gets very cold in the winter and
16:14
there's a lot of snow
16:15
so the the climate really goes from one
16:19
extreme
16:19
to the other extreme from summer to
16:22
winter
16:23
and sure it might be mild in the spring
16:25
and the fall
16:27
now miami is one of the i don't know if
16:30
it's the
16:30
southernmost i think it might be the
16:32
southernmost the most
16:34
southern city in the continental
16:38
united states so on the continent the
16:40
the all the states that are all together
16:42
i think miami is the southern most large
16:46
city so obviously in the south it's very
16:49
hot and it's actually
16:51
a little tropical in miami of course
16:55
a lot of florida has is is jungle so
16:58
it's a tropical-like
16:59
environment so of course miami will be
17:02
hot
17:03
it says dry summers i don't agree with
17:06
that my brother lives in
17:08
in florida and in the summertime it's
17:10
very humid
17:11
it's uncomfortably humid you go outside
17:15
in a t-shirt and shorts and you start
17:17
sweating
17:18
immediately because it's so hot and
17:21
humid
17:22
in florida so it's very hot summers
17:25
and it's very rainy also in their rainy
17:28
season
17:29
of course they're mild they have mild
17:31
winters mild again means not severe or
17:34
not extreme
17:35
so many people who live in the northern
17:39
parts of the united states especially in
17:40
the north
17:41
on the east coast will move down to
17:44
florida
17:44
and miami for the winter time because
17:47
they don't like
17:48
snow so we call these people snow
17:52
birds a snow bird because they're like
17:54
the birds that fly
17:56
south for the winter and then when the
17:58
winter is over
17:59
they fly back to the north to enjoy the
18:02
nice
18:03
cooler summers because of course in
18:05
miami
18:06
it's too hot and too humid in the
18:09
summertime it's it's
18:10
terrible if you don't have air
18:12
conditioning it's really
18:14
very difficult to be outside okay
18:18
washington dc washington dc is on the
18:21
east coast it's in the middle
18:22
it's kind of in the middle part of the
18:24
east coast
18:26
however even though it's in the middle
18:27
part it's still hot in the summertime
18:30
and they have a lot of rain it says wet
18:32
summers but they
18:34
mild winters yeah depends on your
18:36
definition of mild
18:38
washington dc can still get cold and
18:40
they do get snow
18:42
sometimes they get big snowstorms maybe
18:45
not
18:45
as bad as in chicago
18:48
or more northern states like we talked
18:51
about in maine
18:52
but they still do get kind of cold in
18:54
the winter time
18:55
so again washington dc and chicago kind
18:57
of the same
18:58
hot humid summers cold winters but
19:02
chicago is probably
19:03
colder in the winters now seattle is our
19:07
last
19:08
city that we're taking a look at on this
19:09
page and uh where
19:11
chicago miami and washington dc are more
19:14
eastern states
19:15
seattle is all the way on the west coast
19:18
but it's northern west coast it's in the
19:21
pacific
19:22
northwest and this picture is not a very
19:26
good
19:27
representative picture of seattle and
19:30
the reason i say that
19:31
is because the picture shows beautiful
19:34
clear
19:35
blue skies now of course i'm sure that
19:38
there are beautiful clear skies in
19:39
seattle
19:40
a lot of the time but a lot of the time
19:44
most of the time it's rainy in seattle
19:48
seattle gets a lot of rain
19:50
it says it's mild year-round okay it's
19:52
mild that means it doesn't get too hot
19:55
it doesn't get too cold that's true it
19:56
doesn't really snow that much in seattle
19:58
and on the other hand in the summertime
20:00
it doesn't really get that hot
20:02
but it's right on the coast and it gets
20:04
a lot of moisture that
20:06
comes in off the pacific ocean and it
20:09
rains
20:09
almost every day there's a there was a
20:12
tv show i was watching
20:14
the tv show was set in seattle on every
20:17
episode of that tv show
20:19
it was raining it was like wow this city
20:21
really rains a lot
20:22
and i've been there a couple of times
20:24
and it does rain a lot of course
20:26
that makes a lot of nice trees a lot of
20:29
nice greenery
20:30
a very lush environment lots of trees
20:33
lots of grass lots of bushes
20:35
so it's very green in the pacific
20:37
northwest and seattle
20:39
is very is a very green city but it gets
20:42
a lot of rain
20:43
so as we were talking about the united
20:46
states is a very big country
20:48
there are many different climate zones
20:51
in the country whether you're going from
20:53
north to south or even from east to west
20:55
you also have different climate regions
20:58
some regions are
20:59
wet get a lot of rain some regions are
21:02
very dry they're desert
21:04
some regions in the north are very cold
21:06
in the winter and some regions in the
21:08
south
21:09
don't get any snow at all so it's very
21:11
difficult you know if you meet somebody
21:13
from america
21:14
don't say well what's the weather like
21:16
in america because you know what are
21:17
they going to say it depends on where
21:19
they're from
21:20
so of course you know keep that in mind
21:23
right the weather might be very
21:24
different for someone from who
21:26
for someone who's from miami as opposed
21:29
to someone who's from chicago
21:32
or seattle so of course there's lots of
21:34
different climates
21:35
in the united states how about your
21:37
country what is the climate there
21:39
if you live in a large country maybe you
21:41
have many different climates as well
21:43
if you live in a smaller country maybe
21:45
it's an easy
21:46
question to ask or to answer you know
21:49
what's the weather like in your country
21:51
okay well let's move on okay let's do
21:54
the reading passage together and of
21:55
course we're talking about weather and
21:57
climate
21:58
so as i read along please repeat after
22:01
me
22:02
or if that's not a good idea repeat
22:04
along in your mind
22:05
if you're in a crowded place and focus
22:09
on the vocabulary
22:10
in the lesson and also see if you can
22:13
pick up any new words
22:14
okay are you guys ready let's begin
22:18
the weather has a big effect on our
22:21
daily lives
22:23
climate is the weather of a place
22:27
over a long time it makes a difference
22:31
in the way people live
22:36
the climates of some states are usually
22:40
warm all year round
22:43
but to know more about the changing
22:46
weather
22:47
we should watch the weather report
22:53
for example the weather report says
22:56
that tomorrow there will be a storm
23:00
and lightning activity on the west
23:04
coast of the u.s
23:08
lightning means there is a lot of
23:12
electricity
23:13
in the air so we should stay at home
23:17
because it is dangerous outside
23:23
the weather report also says
23:26
there is a chance of snow in maine
23:30
a snowy day is fit for making
23:34
snowmen children in maine
23:37
will wear warm clothes and have fun
23:41
outside that's true if there's a lot of
23:44
snow
23:45
in the area that you live in you know
23:48
it's not you don't don't stay at home
23:49
all day right go out have fun in the
23:51
snow have a snowball fight
23:53
right make a snowman go sledding there's
23:55
many outdoor activities you can do
23:58
in the winter and enjoy the snow okay
24:02
so how is this information organized in
24:05
the reading passage
24:06
in this case we have cause and effect
24:08
right cause
24:10
is an action or something that happens
24:13
and then the result of that action is
24:16
the effect right so you have a cause
24:18
action and then a result or effect so
24:21
cause and effect the cause is on the
24:24
left hand side and the effect is on the
24:26
right hand side
24:27
we have two we have one cause one effect
24:30
second cause second effect let's take a
24:33
look
24:33
okay so first one the weather report
24:37
says that there will be a peep
24:40
and lightning activity a
24:43
what lightning activity in the reading
24:46
passage it says
24:47
the weather report says that there will
24:49
be a storm
24:51
and lightning activity so a storm of
24:54
course you know
24:55
could be rain could be snow a snow storm
24:58
rain rainstorm thunderstorm there's a
25:01
lot of ways we describe storm but in
25:03
this case
25:04
it's just storm we don't have to put a
25:07
storm we don't have to put rain it just
25:10
said storm
25:11
so the weather report says there will be
25:13
a storm and lightning activity so
25:15
what is the effect of that what is the
25:17
result well in this case it's advice
25:20
right we should should means advice so
25:23
what is the result of that
25:26
prediction of that weather forecast
25:29
well the effect of that is advice it's
25:32
we should
25:33
what beep at home what should you do at
25:35
home you should
25:36
stay at home stay inside so we should
25:39
stay
25:41
at home okay that's the first cause in
25:45
fact
25:45
second cause and effect the weather
25:47
report says
25:48
that there is a beep of snow in maine
25:52
so this is very common for weather
25:54
reports right
25:56
it's very difficult to predict the
25:58
future
26:00
it's very and many people don't want to
26:02
say there will be a 100 percent
26:04
chance of something right so they will
26:07
make it smaller
26:08
and it's very common people say there is
26:10
instead of you know
26:12
an 80 chance 60 chance 40
26:15
chance sometimes people just say there
26:17
is a
26:18
chance of so there is a chance of and
26:21
that's a very common thing
26:23
to say especially for weather reports
26:25
oops i put change
26:27
i meant change that g to a c
26:30
yeah that's when you're writing and
26:32
talking at the same time right
26:34
so chance chance c e not ge
26:37
chance ge's change right but we we want
26:40
chance
26:41
the weather report says that there is a
26:43
chance
26:44
of snow in maine by the way when
26:47
somebody says there is a chance of
26:48
something
26:49
that usually implies that there is a
26:53
small
26:53
chance right if you say there's a chance
26:56
of snow
26:57
it means it could happen but it's
27:00
not likely if people want to make it
27:03
stronger they will say
27:04
there is a huge chance that in that case
27:07
that's like 80 percent
27:09
chance of snow there's a huge chance of
27:11
snow
27:12
in maine but if you just say there's a
27:15
chance of snow that's a small
27:16
chance right that's a little chance
27:18
maybe thirty percent
27:20
twenty percent chance of snow so it's
27:23
not likely
27:24
okay the weather report says there is a
27:25
chance of snow in maine
27:28
so the effect of that children in maine
27:31
will wear
27:31
beep clothes and have fun outside of
27:34
course if it does snow
27:35
if it does snow children in maine will
27:38
wear what kind of clothes
27:40
light clothes no they will wear
27:43
heavy clothes warm clothes they will
27:46
wear
27:46
warm clothes and of course you can also
27:49
say
27:49
heavy clothes or winter clothes
27:52
you could also say summer or light
27:55
clothes on the opposite
27:56
side okay so children in maine will wear
27:59
warm clothes
28:00
and have fun outside which is great go
28:03
make a snowman
28:04
have a snowball fight but be careful
28:06
with a snowball fight you know don't hit
28:08
anybody in the head
28:09
right aim for their bodies but that can
28:11
be fun too and of course sledding as
28:13
well
28:13
that's also a fun activity okay so that
28:16
wraps up
28:17
this lesson for today in this lesson we
28:20
took a look at climate especially in the
28:22
united states
28:23
and we saw that there are many different
28:25
uh types
28:26
of climate lots of different uh
28:30
areas or environments in which people
28:32
live and of course
28:33
climate we're talking about uh the
28:36
difference between climate and weather
28:38
climate is the long-term or
28:41
the weather patterns that exist for a
28:44
long time
28:45
in a certain area weather is just what's
28:47
happening today
28:48
right or what will happen tomorrow or
28:51
next week
28:52
weather is just a short time when you're
28:54
looking at
28:55
the weather conditions climate is a
28:57
long-term
28:59
look at weather conditions okay so
29:02
what's the weather like in your country
29:04

29:11
weather to somebody else
29:12
