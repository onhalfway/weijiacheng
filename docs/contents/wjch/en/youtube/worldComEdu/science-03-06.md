hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
i'm brian stewart and today we're
looking at science book
3 lesson 6.
lesson 6 is about soil soil that's like
dirt
so we have a unit about dirt we're going
to learn about dirt today
soil so you'll discover different types
did you know there are different types
of dirt
and there are also different layers of
dirt but let's call it soil because soil
is a more scientific name for dirt
okay so we'll call it soil okay so let's
get started
as usual we'll get started with the
vocabulary here we go
okay our first word is interesting you
may have not heard this word before it's
humus humus the pronunciation is humus
sometimes people get a little confused
about that
but humus think about another word
that's
pronounced very similarly but is a
different word
hugh man but this is humus
so human humus similar pronunciation at
the beginning
humus not human okay and also be careful
because humus is not hummus
hummus is a food from the middle east
humus
is the part of us of soil made from
dead plants or animals so don't get them
confused right
i want some humus for dinner ugh that's
horrible
that's disgusting but hummus is very
delicious
and it's very nutritious it's a good
food for you so
it's interesting hummus
h-u-m-m-u-s hummus
oh yeah that's a food okay so be careful
with these words pronunciation
and don't get it mixed up with the food
from the middle east
okay humus okay good next word
grain grain is a very small
piece of a hard thing not a soft thing
right a hard thing
so a very good example when you go to
the beach
what do you find at the beach you find a
lot of
sand near the water right if you pick up
that sand
is it all together no it's in little
pieces and you let the sand
fall through your fingers through your
hand until just one
piece is left just one piece of sand
and we call that a grain of sand
but grain is also used for many types of
food like if you have wheat or rice
what you have a lot of rice you pick up
rice it all falls through your hand
but you have one piece of rice left and
that piece of rice is
a grain of rice so grain is a very small
piece
one single piece of a hard thing
but it usually occurs in large
quantities
right rice wheat sugar sugar you can
have a grain of sugar
sweet okay anyway that's grain okay
dig do you like to dig in
in your yard now a lot of people
unfortunately don't have yards who live
in high rise apartments
but if you have a backyard you might dig
a hole to put
a plant to put a plant in it now here we
have an
animal that's a professional digger it
digs for a living
well it digs because it lives
underground it's called a mole
m-o-l-e this is a type of animal
right that is a mole
and they dig in the ground they're very
good at digging in the ground many
animals
like to dig in the ground your dog
if it gets the chance might like to dig
a hole
in the ground so to dig okay
and here we have a video of a rabbit
digging rabbits live underground they
will make their home
underground and rabbits can dig a hole
they can
they'll dig and make a little tunnel and
they'll live in a hole with their family
and this is just an example of a rabbit
looks like a rabbit
in a zoo or maybe some kind of
place where you can go see them and they
gave it some dirt because the rabbit's
instinct
is to dig okay next collect
collect means to gather right you want
to get
many different pieces of something and
bring it all together
you collect it so to come or to bring
together
from other places another word
that's very similar to collect is gather
to gather it means to
get many pieces of something and to
bring them all together
in a pile or some kind of organ
organized pile organized stack to
collect
to bring together from other places okay
decompose interesting word decompose
when something dies or you know
when you eat something like an apple
right you eat the app do you eat the
whole apple you don't eat the
the the core of the apple you you throw
it away
well what happens to it it breaks
down over time sun wind
uh rain uh earth you know if it gets
uh trampled um it will break down
over time and it will rot also by itself
right it will turn brown and and turn
into a liquid
and you know kind of go into the ground
decompose that's for dead plants
or dead animals will break down
naturally
and they'll become part of the soil and
what do you call that
humus right okay that's what we learned
at the beginning
okay so decompose
weather now the weather is very powerful
sometimes
and it's always there so over a long
time the weather can have
very dramatic effects but it takes a
long time well sometimes
it can have a very dramatic effect over
a short time if it's a hurricane or
cyclone or
[Music]
uh typhoon change under the action of
the weather
is here so weather it's it's a different
meaning now we know what the weather is
the weather is is it sunny
is it raining is it windy is it cold is
it hot
that's the weather but to weather
something
means to uh to change or to
to have an effect of change over a long
time because the weather
so it's a little bit of a different
sense
whether to to
um yeah to change to to
have an effect i'm trying to make a
different definition for it
to have an uh reaction
i'm sorry a reaction not an reaction a
reaction
to in the environment to the environment
because it's oh sorry environment it's
not just
the weather that you can weather for
example let's say you have a bad
experience
in your life and you survive it but it
teaches you something
so even though that's not the weather
it's a bad experience you weathered it
and hopefully you became stronger
because of it so to weather means to
endure
or to change because of the weather now
this is an interesting picture
like i said i grew up in the southwest
of america we can see many
examples of this the grand canyon is a
good example of course the grand canyon
was formed by a river
but many of the rocks that are still
standing the wind
has been pushing them for centuries
right for hundreds of years sometimes
thousands of years
in some parts of the desert and you can
see that
the rocks have strange shapes they have
some
fantastic shapes sometimes some amazing
shapes and that's because
the wind has been weathering the rocks
for a very long time
so to change into the action the weather
is also to weather
so it's a little bit of a different idea
it's not the weather it's
to weather okay to change under the
action
of the weather okay next we have mixture
so remember i was talking before about
sand rice
sugar wheat right let's say you mixed
all those together
all those little grains you mixed them
together so you have lots of lots of
grains of different things together
that is a mixture okay if you like to
eat grains for
cereal like uh granola granola
is a mixture of different grains you
probably have weed in there
you might have rice you have some nuts
in there you might have some berries in
there
so that's a combination of different
things they're all mixed
together it's delicious when you eat it
for breakfast
okay next we have
pile right we saw that picture before
when we saw collect
right collect you gather when you gather
things together when you collect them
you probably make a pile of something
and your pile can be very
neat and straight if if the things that
you are collecting are
like square or easy to to build on
if they're not square they're round they
kind of roll around like marbles
then you just kind of have a little pile
of
things and it's hard to put marbles on
top of each other
but if you have something else you know
you just make a pile and sometimes your
pile can look like this
if it's if it's you know blocks or
squares you can make a pile
that's very neat but usually a pile of
something
it looks like kind of looks like this
right that's a pile
so a pile of leaves a pile of sand
a pile of grains of something a number
of things on top of each other
okay that's our vocabulary for today
let's talk about some ideas for this
unit the first of all we were talking
about
layers of soil so remember soil is like
dirt you go outside and you look at the
dirt
the grass is growing from the dirt from
the soil
but did you know you only see the top
part right you only see that the
surface of the soil you don't see
underneath
if you dug if you dig a hole then
you can see some usually you can see
layers you can see different
colors or maybe different uh
composition of the soil you know at the
top it might be
looser sandy but underneath it might be
harder right
so that's very interesting we call those
layers right think about your
your bed at home when it's winter time
right maybe you have a thin
sheet first and then you have a nice
thick warm blanket and then you have a
thinner cover over that to protect the
blanket
you have many layers on top of you in
your bed
in the winter time not in the summertime
it's too hot but in the winter time
right
so you have layers the same thing in the
ground we have different
layers of soil so the top layer of the
soil
is called topsoil very easy it's on top
that's a very easy way to remember
topsoil
is very important for farmers farmers
love topsoil they need topsoil
the thing is and this has happened in
america in
states like oklahoma in the 1930s or
1920s
a lot of wind came through and it blew
away all the top soil
and so the farmers couldn't grow the
crops because what's in the topsoil
topsoil is mostly humus and minerals
humus is remember the dead and decaying
parts of animals are things right and
minerals there's a lot of minerals in
topsoil it's the plants need the topsoil
to grow if there's no
topsoil it all blows away then what's
left
is not good there's not really soil it's
just dirt
and the plants can't really grow in it
very well and so you can't grow crops
you don't have food that's a big problem
so
farmers really love topsoil they need
topsoil topsoil
is important for us to grow food now the
middle layer
of soil is called the subsoil sub
because sub means
under right sub means under that's why
we say subway
for subway systems under the street
right subway
sub soil under the top layer there's
less
humus there's more small rocks small
rocks
and minerals now the bottom layer is
called
bedrock bedrock bed it's on the
it's on the bottom it's the bed and it's
mostly
rock now when you hit bedrock if you're
digging a hole let's say you want to
plant a tree in your yard
so you dig a hole you dig through the
top soil
you want to get into the subsoil if you
go down too far
your your shovel's going to hit rock and
that's bedrock
you can't dig into it very easily it's
very difficult to dig into it because
it's mostly rock
okay and that would be the bedrock so
it's interesting to think about these
different
layers of soil okay
there's different kinds of soil too
right there's clay clay
is smooth or sticky and clay
has water in it right so
you usually find clay where there are
rivers or streams
clay is very important because a long
time ago right
people use clay and they they realized
if they get the
the wet it's like wet mud and they could
shape it
they can make shapes out of it they can
make like bowls or pots
to hold water and if they made the shape
and they put it out in the sun
or used a fire to dry it to get all the
water out
it dried and it became very hard and
this is how ancient people
made bowls and pots and
and containers for water or other things
so they use clay humus we talked about
humus humus is brown and soft
sometimes a little smelly but but it's
very important because it has a lot of
nutrients
a lot of minerals and nutrients that
plants need to grow
so if you have a farm with a lot of
humus
in your soil then you will be able to
grow good crops
okay sand is not
good for growing plants right there's
water goes right through sand it doesn't
it doesn't hold on to the water
so the plants can't get water sand is
rough and dry sand is what we find
in the desert if you go to the sahara
desert you can see very beautiful
pictures of the sand dunes they're very
beautiful
and the wind will shape the dunes into
very nice
beautiful shapes so that's sand
then we have silt silt is smooth
and powdery powdery it's like if you
if you hit it right the little powder
comes up
right it's like if you have flour at
home you know you bake cookies
flour is powdery because if you take a
little pinch of it throw it up
it goes up it makes a mess so don't do
that your mom will be angry
okay but anyway that's powdery now silt
is usually found
in rivers and the river or the streams
will take the silt because it's very
it's very small it's very
smooth it's very light and it and it
comes down with the water it doesn't
really sink
it comes with the water and when the
water goes out to the ocean
or the lake the silt will finally you
know there's so much silk coming through
it'll finally get to the bottom
and it'll build up and sometimes the
river has to change because the silt
builds up on the bottom of the river
and and if a lot of silt builds up then
boats can't go up the river
because the silt keeps building up and
it makes the water
less and less and the water has to go
around it okay so those are different
kinds of
soil kind of interesting huh so oh we've
learned a lot of things about dirt today
okay let's get into the reading
okay here's the reading and as usual
please read along with me maybe read
along in your
mind or read along out loud practice the
pronunciation
and focus on the vocabulary words for
today
let's begin soil
is a mixture of weathered rock
minerals humus air
and water when rocks
are weathered they break down
into smaller pieces
sand is a grain of rock
grains can be carried by water
or wind grains
collect in a pile and when mixed with
humus they become soil
when plants or animals die they
decompose
into humus humus
is rich in nutrients
that plants use to grow
there are three main layers of
soil the top layer
has mostly humus in it
most plant roots are in the top
layer of soil
let me interrupt here and this is why
topsoil is so important
because the top layer has mostly humus
in it when plants grow
their roots are usually in the top layer
of soil
because they're getting the nutrients
from the humus okay
let's continue the middle layer has
less humus and more small rocks
and minerals in it
the bottom layer is mostly rock
some animals live in soil when they
dig into the soil they move
humus down this makes the soil
richer in nutrients
and that's very interesting right there
too because think about what kind of
animals live in soil we talked about
moles right rabbits live in soil but
also what else lives in soil smaller
creatures
they're very long they're earthworms
earthworms are very important
to soil and to farmers earth
worms now maybe you think earthworms are
gross
right they're sticky they're they're wet
yeah you don't like to touch them
and they curl around right but they dig
into this topsoil they love humus right
they love to eat
the decomposing uh materials
but as they dig right they put air they
also push the humus down into the soil
and it's very good conditions for
growing plants
so farmers like to have worms they like
earthworms
in their fields because they help they
help the
soil become more
fertile and plants can grow in them
because the earthworms help dig holes in
the humus
and they dig into the soil so that's
interesting
okay let's take a look at some of the uh
organization
of this paragraph of this reading okay
here the reading skill is main idea and
detail so we have a main idea
that is the topic or the theme of the
reading and then we have details
that support that main idea what is the
main idea
the main idea of this reading is that
soil is a mixture of things
soil is a mixture of things soil has
many different things
in it okay that is the main idea what
are the details
well rocks get beep they break down into
beep which are tiny pieces of rock okay
so remember we talked about um in the
sun
you know if it's sunny if it's it's hot
it's cold
maybe it's windy maybe it's raining we
call that
what is the weather but remember weather
has another meaning
weather means to change something
through the weather
and one thing we learned from the
reading is that as the weather usually
the wind
the rain will break down rocks
right if you have big rocks like i said
the grand canyon you have these huge
rocks
and the wind and the rain is constantly
um pushing them and changing them and
breaking off break down into smaller
pieces
so that process is called weathering
so rocks get weathered
w e a t
h e r and because it's a
verb not a noun we say weathered
so remember you can think about whether
is a noun you know what is the weather
like
or you can think about whether as a verb
right
to whether something means to change
because
of usually the weather but it could be
an experience like i said before
so weathered rocks get weathered they
break down into what
small pieces what are tiny pieces we
call those grains remember
oops well that was weird grains
okay so i don't know why that big long
line did
ignore that okay grains they break down
into grains
which are tiny pieces of rock
okay grains are carried by
beep or wind okay
they collect in a pile and are mixed
with
humus so grains are carried by what what
are the two things that i talked about
uh that carry uh soil whether it's
um silt right i remember when i talked
about silt
i was talking about how they were moving
they're carried by water
so they are carried by water or wind
water
or wind grains are carried by water or
wind
they collect in a pile and are mixed
with humus
when plants and animals die they beep
into humus
so when something dies right i said it
changes right
the weather may change it but also the
internal
processes the cells breaking down they
will normally just break down it smells
bad
uh and it also um but it breaks down it
changes
in many cases it changes from a solid to
a liquid also and it goes into the soil
that way
and what do we call that process it's
decompose
so d compose
decompose when plants and animals die
they decompose
into humus okay and remember humus is
very good for plants to grow
and when you think about it this is part
of the cycle of life that we talked
about before right
when something dies right it's uh
it decomposes it goes into the soil
right and this creates humus and then
plants okay i'm not a very good artist
plants can grow i don't know what that
is
a tree let's say it's a tree okay and
then they have little apples it's an
apple tree so somebody comes by and eats
it
they throw it oops they throw it down
and then it turns into hummus again
and then it keeps going right it's a
cycle of life
okay and that's just part of life but
next time you go out
into the into nature not in the city
where it's concrete and
asphalt on streets but go out into
nature where there's trees and there's
grass
take a look at the ground and think
about what's going on under the surface
of the ground
right you can see the surface that's the
top soil where all the grass
and the trees are getting their
nutrients right and remember there's
different layers if you dig into that
soil
you can see different layers and
different parts of the soil
right and that's all underground it's
hidden unless you know about it and now
you know about it okay
so that's kind of an interesting thing
about our world and i hope you learned a
lot in this lesson
thanks for studying with me and we'll
see you in the next one take care
bye bye
you

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:12
textbook reading
00:13
i'm brian stewart and today we're
00:15
looking at science book
00:16
3 lesson 6.
00:20
lesson 6 is about soil soil that's like
00:23
dirt
00:24
so we have a unit about dirt we're going
00:26
to learn about dirt today
00:28
soil so you'll discover different types
00:30
did you know there are different types
00:32
of dirt
00:33
and there are also different layers of
00:36
dirt but let's call it soil because soil
00:39
is a more scientific name for dirt
00:42
okay so we'll call it soil okay so let's
00:45
get started
00:46
as usual we'll get started with the
00:48
vocabulary here we go
00:52
okay our first word is interesting you
00:55
may have not heard this word before it's
00:58
humus humus the pronunciation is humus
01:01
sometimes people get a little confused
01:04
about that
01:04
but humus think about another word
01:07
that's
01:08
pronounced very similarly but is a
01:11
different word
01:12
hugh man but this is humus
01:16
so human humus similar pronunciation at
01:20
the beginning
01:21
humus not human okay and also be careful
01:25
because humus is not hummus
01:28
hummus is a food from the middle east
01:31
humus
01:32
is the part of us of soil made from
01:36
dead plants or animals so don't get them
01:38
confused right
01:41
i want some humus for dinner ugh that's
01:43
horrible
01:44
that's disgusting but hummus is very
01:46
delicious
01:47
and it's very nutritious it's a good
01:49
food for you so
01:51
it's interesting hummus
01:55
h-u-m-m-u-s hummus
01:57
oh yeah that's a food okay so be careful
02:01
with these words pronunciation
02:03
and don't get it mixed up with the food
02:05
from the middle east
02:06
okay humus okay good next word
02:11
grain grain is a very small
02:14
piece of a hard thing not a soft thing
02:18
right a hard thing
02:19
so a very good example when you go to
02:22
the beach
02:23
what do you find at the beach you find a
02:26
lot of
02:26
sand near the water right if you pick up
02:29
that sand
02:30
is it all together no it's in little
02:32
pieces and you let the sand
02:34
fall through your fingers through your
02:36
hand until just one
02:37
piece is left just one piece of sand
02:40
and we call that a grain of sand
02:44
but grain is also used for many types of
02:46
food like if you have wheat or rice
02:49
what you have a lot of rice you pick up
02:51
rice it all falls through your hand
02:53
but you have one piece of rice left and
02:56
that piece of rice is
02:57
a grain of rice so grain is a very small
03:00
piece
03:01
one single piece of a hard thing
03:04
but it usually occurs in large
03:07
quantities
03:08
right rice wheat sugar sugar you can
03:12
have a grain of sugar
03:14
sweet okay anyway that's grain okay
03:18
dig do you like to dig in
03:21
in your yard now a lot of people
03:23
unfortunately don't have yards who live
03:24
in high rise apartments
03:26
but if you have a backyard you might dig
03:29
a hole to put
03:30
a plant to put a plant in it now here we
03:33
have an
03:33
animal that's a professional digger it
03:36
digs for a living
03:37
well it digs because it lives
03:38
underground it's called a mole
03:41
m-o-l-e this is a type of animal
03:44
right that is a mole
03:48
and they dig in the ground they're very
03:51
good at digging in the ground many
03:52
animals
03:53
like to dig in the ground your dog
03:57
if it gets the chance might like to dig
03:59
a hole
04:00
in the ground so to dig okay
04:04
and here we have a video of a rabbit
04:08
digging rabbits live underground they
04:10
will make their home
04:12
underground and rabbits can dig a hole
04:15
they can
04:15
they'll dig and make a little tunnel and
04:17
they'll live in a hole with their family
04:19
and this is just an example of a rabbit
04:22
looks like a rabbit
04:23
in a zoo or maybe some kind of
04:27
place where you can go see them and they
04:29
gave it some dirt because the rabbit's
04:31
instinct
04:32
is to dig okay next collect
04:36
collect means to gather right you want
04:39
to get
04:39
many different pieces of something and
04:42
bring it all together
04:43
you collect it so to come or to bring
04:46
together
04:48
from other places another word
04:52
that's very similar to collect is gather
04:57
to gather it means to
05:01
get many pieces of something and to
05:03
bring them all together
05:05
in a pile or some kind of organ
05:08
organized pile organized stack to
05:11
collect
05:12
to bring together from other places okay
05:16
decompose interesting word decompose
05:21
when something dies or you know
05:24
when you eat something like an apple
05:26
right you eat the app do you eat the
05:27
whole apple you don't eat the
05:29
the the core of the apple you you throw
05:32
it away
05:33
well what happens to it it breaks
05:36
down over time sun wind
05:40
uh rain uh earth you know if it gets
05:44
uh trampled um it will break down
05:47
over time and it will rot also by itself
05:51
right it will turn brown and and turn
05:54
into a liquid
05:55
and you know kind of go into the ground
05:57
decompose that's for dead plants
05:59
or dead animals will break down
06:01
naturally
06:02
and they'll become part of the soil and
06:04
what do you call that
06:06
humus right okay that's what we learned
06:08
at the beginning
06:09
okay so decompose
06:13
weather now the weather is very powerful
06:17
sometimes
06:18
and it's always there so over a long
06:21
time the weather can have
06:23
very dramatic effects but it takes a
06:25
long time well sometimes
06:26
it can have a very dramatic effect over
06:28
a short time if it's a hurricane or
06:30
cyclone or
06:31
[Music]
06:33
uh typhoon change under the action of
06:35
the weather
06:36
is here so weather it's it's a different
06:39
meaning now we know what the weather is
06:41
the weather is is it sunny
06:42
is it raining is it windy is it cold is
06:45
it hot
06:46
that's the weather but to weather
06:49
something
06:50
means to uh to change or to
06:53
to have an effect of change over a long
06:56
time because the weather
06:58
so it's a little bit of a different
07:00
sense
07:01
whether to to
07:05
um yeah to change to to
07:10
have an effect i'm trying to make a
07:12
different definition for it
07:14
to have an uh reaction
07:17
i'm sorry a reaction not an reaction a
07:20
reaction
07:23
to in the environment to the environment
07:28
because it's oh sorry environment it's
07:31
not just
07:32
the weather that you can weather for
07:34
example let's say you have a bad
07:36
experience
07:37
in your life and you survive it but it
07:39
teaches you something
07:41
so even though that's not the weather
07:42
it's a bad experience you weathered it
07:45
and hopefully you became stronger
07:47
because of it so to weather means to
07:49
endure
07:50
or to change because of the weather now
07:52
this is an interesting picture
07:54
like i said i grew up in the southwest
07:56
of america we can see many
07:58
examples of this the grand canyon is a
08:00
good example of course the grand canyon
08:02
was formed by a river
08:03
but many of the rocks that are still
08:05
standing the wind
08:07
has been pushing them for centuries
08:10
right for hundreds of years sometimes
08:12
thousands of years
08:13
in some parts of the desert and you can
08:16
see that
08:17
the rocks have strange shapes they have
08:19
some
08:20
fantastic shapes sometimes some amazing
08:22
shapes and that's because
08:24
the wind has been weathering the rocks
08:27
for a very long time
08:29
so to change into the action the weather
08:31
is also to weather
08:33
so it's a little bit of a different idea
08:35
it's not the weather it's
08:37
to weather okay to change under the
08:39
action
08:40
of the weather okay next we have mixture
08:44
so remember i was talking before about
08:46
sand rice
08:47
sugar wheat right let's say you mixed
08:50
all those together
08:51
all those little grains you mixed them
08:52
together so you have lots of lots of
08:54
grains of different things together
08:56
that is a mixture okay if you like to
08:59
eat grains for
09:00
cereal like uh granola granola
09:04
is a mixture of different grains you
09:06
probably have weed in there
09:08
you might have rice you have some nuts
09:10
in there you might have some berries in
09:12
there
09:12
so that's a combination of different
09:14
things they're all mixed
09:16
together it's delicious when you eat it
09:18
for breakfast
09:20
okay next we have
09:23
pile right we saw that picture before
09:26
when we saw collect
09:27
right collect you gather when you gather
09:30
things together when you collect them
09:32
you probably make a pile of something
09:34
and your pile can be very
09:36
neat and straight if if the things that
09:38
you are collecting are
09:40
like square or easy to to build on
09:43
if they're not square they're round they
09:45
kind of roll around like marbles
09:47
then you just kind of have a little pile
09:49
of
09:50
things and it's hard to put marbles on
09:52
top of each other
09:53
but if you have something else you know
09:55
you just make a pile and sometimes your
09:57
pile can look like this
09:58
if it's if it's you know blocks or
10:02
squares you can make a pile
10:03
that's very neat but usually a pile of
10:06
something
10:06
it looks like kind of looks like this
10:09
right that's a pile
10:10
so a pile of leaves a pile of sand
10:14
a pile of grains of something a number
10:17
of things on top of each other
10:19
okay that's our vocabulary for today
10:23
let's talk about some ideas for this
10:25
unit the first of all we were talking
10:26
about
10:27
layers of soil so remember soil is like
10:29
dirt you go outside and you look at the
10:31
dirt
10:32
the grass is growing from the dirt from
10:34
the soil
10:35
but did you know you only see the top
10:38
part right you only see that the
10:39
surface of the soil you don't see
10:42
underneath
10:42
if you dug if you dig a hole then
10:46
you can see some usually you can see
10:49
layers you can see different
10:50
colors or maybe different uh
10:53
composition of the soil you know at the
10:56
top it might be
10:57
looser sandy but underneath it might be
10:59
harder right
11:00
so that's very interesting we call those
11:02
layers right think about your
11:04
your bed at home when it's winter time
11:07
right maybe you have a thin
11:09
sheet first and then you have a nice
11:12
thick warm blanket and then you have a
11:14
thinner cover over that to protect the
11:17
blanket
11:17
you have many layers on top of you in
11:20
your bed
11:20
in the winter time not in the summertime
11:22
it's too hot but in the winter time
11:24
right
11:25
so you have layers the same thing in the
11:27
ground we have different
11:28
layers of soil so the top layer of the
11:32
soil
11:33
is called topsoil very easy it's on top
11:36
that's a very easy way to remember
11:39
topsoil
11:40
is very important for farmers farmers
11:44
love topsoil they need topsoil
11:47
the thing is and this has happened in
11:49
america in
11:50
states like oklahoma in the 1930s or
11:53
1920s
11:54
a lot of wind came through and it blew
11:57
away all the top soil
11:59
and so the farmers couldn't grow the
12:01
crops because what's in the topsoil
12:03
topsoil is mostly humus and minerals
12:06
humus is remember the dead and decaying
12:09
parts of animals are things right and
12:13
minerals there's a lot of minerals in
12:14
topsoil it's the plants need the topsoil
12:17
to grow if there's no
12:18
topsoil it all blows away then what's
12:21
left
12:22
is not good there's not really soil it's
12:25
just dirt
12:26
and the plants can't really grow in it
12:27
very well and so you can't grow crops
12:30
you don't have food that's a big problem
12:32
so
12:33
farmers really love topsoil they need
12:36
topsoil topsoil
12:38
is important for us to grow food now the
12:40
middle layer
12:41
of soil is called the subsoil sub
12:44
because sub means
12:45
under right sub means under that's why
12:48
we say subway
12:49
for subway systems under the street
12:52
right subway
12:53
sub soil under the top layer there's
12:56
less
12:57
humus there's more small rocks small
13:01
rocks
13:01
and minerals now the bottom layer is
13:04
called
13:04
bedrock bedrock bed it's on the
13:08
it's on the bottom it's the bed and it's
13:11
mostly
13:12
rock now when you hit bedrock if you're
13:15
digging a hole let's say you want to
13:16
plant a tree in your yard
13:18
so you dig a hole you dig through the
13:20
top soil
13:21
you want to get into the subsoil if you
13:24
go down too far
13:25
your your shovel's going to hit rock and
13:28
that's bedrock
13:29
you can't dig into it very easily it's
13:32
very difficult to dig into it because
13:34
it's mostly rock
13:36
okay and that would be the bedrock so
13:37
it's interesting to think about these
13:39
different
13:39
layers of soil okay
13:43
there's different kinds of soil too
13:45
right there's clay clay
13:47
is smooth or sticky and clay
13:50
has water in it right so
13:53
you usually find clay where there are
13:56
rivers or streams
13:57
clay is very important because a long
13:59
time ago right
14:00
people use clay and they they realized
14:03
if they get the
14:04
the wet it's like wet mud and they could
14:07
shape it
14:08
they can make shapes out of it they can
14:10
make like bowls or pots
14:12
to hold water and if they made the shape
14:13
and they put it out in the sun
14:15
or used a fire to dry it to get all the
14:18
water out
14:18
it dried and it became very hard and
14:21
this is how ancient people
14:23
made bowls and pots and
14:26
and containers for water or other things
14:30
so they use clay humus we talked about
14:34
humus humus is brown and soft
14:36
sometimes a little smelly but but it's
14:38
very important because it has a lot of
14:40
nutrients
14:41
a lot of minerals and nutrients that
14:43
plants need to grow
14:45
so if you have a farm with a lot of
14:48
humus
14:48
in your soil then you will be able to
14:51
grow good crops
14:53
okay sand is not
14:57
good for growing plants right there's
15:00
water goes right through sand it doesn't
15:02
it doesn't hold on to the water
15:04
so the plants can't get water sand is
15:06
rough and dry sand is what we find
15:08
in the desert if you go to the sahara
15:10
desert you can see very beautiful
15:12
pictures of the sand dunes they're very
15:15
beautiful
15:15
and the wind will shape the dunes into
15:18
very nice
15:20
beautiful shapes so that's sand
15:23
then we have silt silt is smooth
15:26
and powdery powdery it's like if you
15:29
if you hit it right the little powder
15:32
comes up
15:33
right it's like if you have flour at
15:36
home you know you bake cookies
15:38
flour is powdery because if you take a
15:40
little pinch of it throw it up
15:42
it goes up it makes a mess so don't do
15:44
that your mom will be angry
15:46
okay but anyway that's powdery now silt
15:49
is usually found
15:50
in rivers and the river or the streams
15:54
will take the silt because it's very
15:56
it's very small it's very
15:58
smooth it's very light and it and it
16:00
comes down with the water it doesn't
16:01
really sink
16:02
it comes with the water and when the
16:04
water goes out to the ocean
16:05
or the lake the silt will finally you
16:08
know there's so much silk coming through
16:10
it'll finally get to the bottom
16:11
and it'll build up and sometimes the
16:13
river has to change because the silt
16:16
builds up on the bottom of the river
16:17
and and if a lot of silt builds up then
16:19
boats can't go up the river
16:21
because the silt keeps building up and
16:23
it makes the water
16:25
less and less and the water has to go
16:26
around it okay so those are different
16:29
kinds of
16:30
soil kind of interesting huh so oh we've
16:33
learned a lot of things about dirt today
16:35
okay let's get into the reading
16:42
okay here's the reading and as usual
16:44
please read along with me maybe read
16:46
along in your
16:47
mind or read along out loud practice the
16:49
pronunciation
16:50
and focus on the vocabulary words for
16:53
today
16:54
let's begin soil
16:57
is a mixture of weathered rock
17:01
minerals humus air
17:05
and water when rocks
17:08
are weathered they break down
17:12
into smaller pieces
17:17
sand is a grain of rock
17:21
grains can be carried by water
17:24
or wind grains
17:28
collect in a pile and when mixed with
17:32
humus they become soil
17:38
when plants or animals die they
17:41
decompose
17:43
into humus humus
17:46
is rich in nutrients
17:50
that plants use to grow
17:55
there are three main layers of
17:58
soil the top layer
18:01
has mostly humus in it
18:05
most plant roots are in the top
18:09
layer of soil
18:12
let me interrupt here and this is why
18:15
topsoil is so important
18:16
because the top layer has mostly humus
18:19
in it when plants grow
18:20
their roots are usually in the top layer
18:23
of soil
18:24
because they're getting the nutrients
18:26
from the humus okay
18:28
let's continue the middle layer has
18:32
less humus and more small rocks
18:35
and minerals in it
18:40
the bottom layer is mostly rock
18:45
some animals live in soil when they
18:48
dig into the soil they move
18:52
humus down this makes the soil
18:56
richer in nutrients
19:00
and that's very interesting right there
19:02
too because think about what kind of
19:04
animals live in soil we talked about
19:06
moles right rabbits live in soil but
19:09
also what else lives in soil smaller
19:11
creatures
19:12
they're very long they're earthworms
19:14
earthworms are very important
19:17
to soil and to farmers earth
19:21
worms now maybe you think earthworms are
19:24
gross
19:24
right they're sticky they're they're wet
19:26
yeah you don't like to touch them
19:28
and they curl around right but they dig
19:31
into this topsoil they love humus right
19:33
they love to eat
19:34
the decomposing uh materials
19:38
but as they dig right they put air they
19:40
also push the humus down into the soil
19:43
and it's very good conditions for
19:46
growing plants
19:47
so farmers like to have worms they like
19:49
earthworms
19:50
in their fields because they help they
19:53
help the
19:54
soil become more
19:58
fertile and plants can grow in them
20:00
because the earthworms help dig holes in
20:02
the humus
20:03
and they dig into the soil so that's
20:05
interesting
20:06
okay let's take a look at some of the uh
20:09
organization
20:10
of this paragraph of this reading okay
20:15
here the reading skill is main idea and
20:17
detail so we have a main idea
20:20
that is the topic or the theme of the
20:23
reading and then we have details
20:25
that support that main idea what is the
20:28
main idea
20:29
the main idea of this reading is that
20:31
soil is a mixture of things
20:35
soil is a mixture of things soil has
20:36
many different things
20:38
in it okay that is the main idea what
20:41
are the details
20:42
well rocks get beep they break down into
20:46
beep which are tiny pieces of rock okay
20:50
so remember we talked about um in the
20:54
sun
20:54
you know if it's sunny if it's it's hot
20:56
it's cold
20:57
maybe it's windy maybe it's raining we
21:00
call that
21:00
what is the weather but remember weather
21:02
has another meaning
21:04
weather means to change something
21:06
through the weather
21:07
and one thing we learned from the
21:08
reading is that as the weather usually
21:11
the wind
21:12
the rain will break down rocks
21:15
right if you have big rocks like i said
21:17
the grand canyon you have these huge
21:19
rocks
21:20
and the wind and the rain is constantly
21:23
um pushing them and changing them and
21:26
breaking off break down into smaller
21:29
pieces
21:30
so that process is called weathering
21:33
so rocks get weathered
21:36
w e a t
21:39
h e r and because it's a
21:43
verb not a noun we say weathered
21:47
so remember you can think about whether
21:49
is a noun you know what is the weather
21:51
like
21:52
or you can think about whether as a verb
21:54
right
21:55
to whether something means to change
21:58
because
21:58
of usually the weather but it could be
22:00
an experience like i said before
22:02
so weathered rocks get weathered they
22:04
break down into what
22:06
small pieces what are tiny pieces we
22:09
call those grains remember
22:11
oops well that was weird grains
22:16
okay so i don't know why that big long
22:18
line did
22:20
ignore that okay grains they break down
22:23
into grains
22:24
which are tiny pieces of rock
22:27
okay grains are carried by
22:30
beep or wind okay
22:34
they collect in a pile and are mixed
22:36
with
22:37
humus so grains are carried by what what
22:40
are the two things that i talked about
22:42
uh that carry uh soil whether it's
22:45
um silt right i remember when i talked
22:48
about silt
22:49
i was talking about how they were moving
22:51
they're carried by water
22:53
so they are carried by water or wind
22:56
water
22:58
or wind grains are carried by water or
23:01
wind
23:01
they collect in a pile and are mixed
23:03
with humus
23:06
when plants and animals die they beep
23:09
into humus
23:10
so when something dies right i said it
23:12
changes right
23:14
the weather may change it but also the
23:16
internal
23:17
processes the cells breaking down they
23:20
will normally just break down it smells
23:21
bad
23:22
uh and it also um but it breaks down it
23:25
changes
23:25
in many cases it changes from a solid to
23:27
a liquid also and it goes into the soil
23:30
that way
23:30
and what do we call that process it's
23:32
decompose
23:34
so d compose
23:41
decompose when plants and animals die
23:43
they decompose
23:45
into humus okay and remember humus is
23:49
very good for plants to grow
23:50
and when you think about it this is part
23:52
of the cycle of life that we talked
23:54
about before right
23:55
when something dies right it's uh
23:58
it decomposes it goes into the soil
24:02
right and this creates humus and then
24:05
plants okay i'm not a very good artist
24:08
plants can grow i don't know what that
24:10
is
24:12
a tree let's say it's a tree okay and
24:14
then they have little apples it's an
24:16
apple tree so somebody comes by and eats
24:18
it
24:18
they throw it oops they throw it down
24:20
and then it turns into hummus again
24:22
and then it keeps going right it's a
24:24
cycle of life
24:25
okay and that's just part of life but
24:28
next time you go out
24:29
into the into nature not in the city
24:32
where it's concrete and
24:34
asphalt on streets but go out into
24:36
nature where there's trees and there's
24:37
grass
24:38
take a look at the ground and think
24:39
about what's going on under the surface
24:42
of the ground
24:42
right you can see the surface that's the
24:44
top soil where all the grass
24:46
and the trees are getting their
24:47
nutrients right and remember there's
24:49
different layers if you dig into that
24:51
soil
24:51
you can see different layers and
24:53
different parts of the soil
24:55
right and that's all underground it's
