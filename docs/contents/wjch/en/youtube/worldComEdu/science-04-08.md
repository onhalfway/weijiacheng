hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
today we're looking at science book 4
lesson eight
rocks and minerals rocks and minerals
you know my dad is a geologist i think
he should teach this lesson
but he's not here so let's continue okay
anyway
in this lesson you will discover
different types of rocks
and minerals and also how
glass is made okay so let's begin
okay in our vocabulary list the first
word
is bolder bolder when you say this word
you feel like something big and round
right bolder
a boulder of course is a large rounded
rock made by weathering
what is weathering well of course
weather
it comes from the word weather weather
is like rain if it's
sunny that's a certain type of weather
if it's rainy that's another type of
weather
but of course we talked about this in an
earlier unit
over a long time rain
wind snow freezing melting
can have an effect on rocks and it can
make
new rocks and boulders of course big
pieces of rock
that are carved really by the wind and
sometimes by the motion
of landslides and things like that rocks
will break up
and they will become smooth because
they'll wear away
and they're round and we call these
large rocks boulders
this is a really large rock isn't it
that's a person standing next to it
right there
so imagine how big that rock is so of
course
you know boulders can be bigger than you
know many houses put together
of course boulders can also be smaller
but they have to be a certain size i
mean if you have a rock like this
that's not a boulder but if you have
something that's pretty big it's
heavy to pick up you could call that a
boulder okay
but a small rock no that's not a boulder
it's a large rock
okay next we have limestone
now limestone is a gray colored rock
used in buildings it's a very uh
uh hard uh rock type of rock of course
there's many types of rocks
some rocks are harder than other rocks
some rocks are very soft and will
crumble easily but limestone is very
tough
and people will use it to make buildings
because it's tough
and it doesn't uh crumble or break apart
easily so that's limestone
next we have marble now marble is also
a very strong type of rock but
it is all it can also be a very
beautiful type of rock
it's a hard rock that is shiny when
cut and polished so usually people will
cut like
sheets of marble if they find marble of
course it's just rock
underground or sometimes it's exposed
because of the weather
but when people will find that they will
they will
make it's kind of like a mine but they
call it a quarry
a quarry and what they do is they they
will go in they will
cut like pieces of rock and you can cut
like
square or rectangular slabs
of marble and then you can use that in
your building
a lot of people like to have marble
countertops
in their kitchen and of course there are
many different types many different
colors
designs and so and when you polish them
they look very beautiful of course
they're very strong and resistant so
when you know somebody's in the kitchen
and cutting and cooking and banging pots
and pans
it doesn't hurt the marble so many
people like to use marble
in their kitchen on top of their
countertops
okay next we have mineral
there are many minerals and minerals are
found in rocks they are useful
substances
use minerals are useful substances if
it's useful
it's a type of mineral that is formed
naturally
in the ground just like rocks okay so
minerals are different types of useful
substances found in the ground what
kinds of minerals are there well we'll
find out more
in the lesson but there are many
different types
graphite graphite is a type of mineral
now what do we use graphite for well
first of all
it's soft it's black and it
it's not a hard rock if you put some
pressure on it
little pieces of it will break off and
in fact
it's very useful when you think about it
because if you have a piece of graphite
you can put wind oh you can put wind you
can put
wood around it so you hold it the
graphite doesn't mark your fingers
but if the little piece of graphite is
sticking out the end that of course is a
pencil
and you can write with it so when you
write with a pencil
you're actually rubbing part of the
graphite that mineral
onto the paper and it stays onto the
paper
right so it's a very useful mineral
obviously for
writing notes or to write messages to
other people
and of course we use those in pencils
and also uh what you what you call um
what what do they say uh click pen or we
call it a mechanical pencil
i forgot what many people sometimes call
it but it's a mechanical pencil
when you have just a little thin piece
of graphite and you put it into a
it's like a machine a pencil and then
you just click the button
and it pushes the pencil or the graphite
out as you
write okay so that would be a mechanical
pencil as well
next we have quartz now quartz is
another type of
mineral and it's a hard mineral that is
white
or colorless it's it's actually kind of
uh
nice looking many people we use quartz
to decorate
things but we also use quartz to do
something else and we'll talk about that
in the reading passage okay so that's
quartz
and quartz is a very interesting rock
right it forms these
crystals now many minerals will form
what we call
crystals right
and it's the chemical it's it's the way
the molecular structure it now i'm
getting too deep
here but the molecular structure of the
mineral will form itself in a certain
way
to make a crystal and that's what we
have here we have quartz crystals
in this rock okay concrete
concrete is a hard building material
made using limestone so actually the
romans
were very famous for uh using and
developing this technology
they would use they would make concrete
they even had concrete that they could
make
underwater to build many of the amazing
buildings that the roman empire built
both in their city of rome but also
in you know the aqueducts and other many
other cities
in their empire they used concrete
to build their buildings the hard
building material and they could shape
it
the nice thing about concrete is that
you can shape it
into the shape that you want it's wet at
first and you
pour it it's like a liquid but a very
heavy liquid you pour it
into a shape and then it gets hard and
then you can use that for bricks
or columns or really anything
to make your building with so it's a
very useful
building material next we have
carve carve means to
make something by cutting into it and
usually people
will cut into wood or stone
of course if you cut into wood you just
need a sharp knife and be careful
obviously if you're going to
carve a figure some people like to carve
little animals or little people
out of pieces of wood you could also
carve a walking stick you can make
interesting designs with a knife on a
piece of wood
but if you cut stone you can't use a
knife right
you have to use a hammer and a chisel
because a knife is not sharp enough to
cut rock
but a hammer and a chisel has enough
force
to very gently carve away
the stone and you look this person is a
very good artist
they're very skilled because they they
know how to use the hammer and chisel
to make very beautiful and detailed
carvings okay next statue
of course a statue is a carving made
out of a rock usually marble
but you could also make them out of
stone other types of stone
or metal even well metal is easier
because you can heat metal so it's a
liquid and just pour it
into a form and then you don't really
have to carve it but anyway
an object made in solid material such as
a stone or metal
and of course this is probably a very
famous statue
looks like greek or roman
era statue many greeks and romans made
statues like this of the famous people
or people who are in legends or myths
they made statues of them to remind them
and it's a part of their culture
it's also a very important art form
so a statue and we can see many statues
today
as well of famous people okay so those
are our words for the lesson
now one of the main ideas of this lesson
of course is that there are many
different types of rocks and there are
many different types of minerals
so what are the different types of rocks
we looked at we looked at
boulders we looked at limestone
and we looked at marble these are all
different types of rocks
they aren't minerals they are rocks okay
and usually these rocks are formed
over a very long time by pressures
in the environment boulders are formed
by wind
rain movement of the earth
limestone is formed and marble also
is formed by many layers of mud
and silt and things being pressed very
hard
by other material on top of it for a
very long time and becoming a very
strong
substance and marble of course is very
interesting too
in these rocks that we can cut them into
shapes
and use them in our buildings now those
are rocks
different types of minerals minerals we
have quartz
copper and graphite so we can see oh
copper
copper is a metal sure but it's also a
type of mineral
so many precious metals like copper gold
silver
are types of minerals and so quartz
copper graphite
these are different types of minerals
another idea in this unit is how glass
is made
because you think about glass is glass a
rock
is it a mineral well actually glass is
made now
glass can be made naturally but
uh if it's made by humans humans can
make
glass in a lot of different varieties
shapes and even colors
and of course humans have perfected
the technique or technology of making
glass
so we can see glass all around us and we
use glass and a lot of the objects
that we use every day so how is it made
well first of all sand is the basic
ingredient
and sand is made of tiny pieces of rock
so again boulders are big pieces of rock
made by wind and rain
but over time that boulder you know the
wind and the rain
and the elements will constantly wear
away the boulder
and little pieces of that boulder will
be blown away in the wind
and that's sand right and a lot of sand
as well is on the beach also
because sand is also produced by fish
eating coral
right that's another way that sand is
made
so sand is made of tiny pieces of rock
and at high temperature when there's a
very high temperature
sand and other ingredients are mixed
together
in a very high temperature and when the
material
cools it becomes glass
now it's very interesting that some
places uh
where there's a lot of storms and a lot
of lightning
people will actually put metal poles in
the beach
why do they do that because they want to
attract lightning
lightning will hit the metal pole and of
course it'll make it very hot
the whole metal pole the metal pole
that's in the sand will create natural
glass
and sometimes if lightning hits the
beach or in sandy area
because it's so hot it will turn that
sand into glass
that won't be the clear glass in your
car
or in your house it'll be you know it
won't be perfect glass
but that's how people first discovered
glass and they perfected it
to make very useful glass glass that we
can
see through or tinted glass or colored
glass for churches
to make very beautiful windows so
basically that's how they make glass so
they first observed it in nature
and then they figured out how they could
develop that
uh those materials and use you know
perfect
the technique to make all sorts of
different glass and you can see
you know lots of different designs and
you can shape glass
into many different shapes we can make
cups out of it we can make windshields
for our cars
out of it we can make windows for our
house out of it
so glass is very useful is a very useful
material
oh and by the way one more thing about
glass i'm sorry i'm going too long but
do you know glass when they make it it's
not set
over time glass is is a solid substance
but it's a little bit liquid too because
over a long time hundreds of years
if you have a piece of glass in a house
a very old house
look at that glass at the top of the
glass it will be
thinner at the bottom it will be thicker
because
slowly slowly slowly over time that
glass
is flowing down because of gravity
so it's not a liquid right but it's
it's a solid but it's kind of in between
it's
it's not it obviously not a liquid but
over time
the glass will flow down and the the
material the glass will flow down
like a liquid and become thicker at the
bottom and thinner at the top
that's just an interesting fact about
glass interesting huh
okay anyway let's take a look at the
reading passage and as usual as i read
it you know read along with me or read
along in your mind
and focus on the words in the from the
vocabulary you guys ready
let's begin rocks are everywhere
on earth rocks can be many shapes
and sizes boulders
are large rocks
boulders can be larger than a house
we use rocks in many ways
limestone is a rock limestone
is used to make concrete concrete
is used to build houses and roads
marble is a beautiful rock marble can be
carved statues are carved
from marble
rocks are made up of minerals
minerals are non-living solids
there are many types of minerals and
they have many uses
quartz copper and graphite
are minerals
quartz is found in many rocks and sand
quartz is used with minerals from
limestone
to make glass copper is used to make
pots quartz and copper
are hard minerals
graphite is used to make pencils
graphite in a pencil is the black part
we use to write graphite
is a soft mineral
okay let's take a look at the reading
passage and see how the information
is organized a very common
organizational method
is to have the main ideas and then
details
to support that main idea what is the
main idea
of this reading passage the main idea is
rocks
and minerals have many uses
okay that's a true statement so now
let's support it
with evidence with examples
and details so what's the first
thing that we use to support that idea
that rocks and minerals have many uses
first of all we have we'll have a blank
beep is used to make
concrete so what type of rock or mineral
is used to make
concrete if you remember from the
reading passage that
rock is limestone
lime stone
limestone limestone is used to make
concrete minerals
in it are also used with another
substance to make glass in this case
we're using we're mixing it with a
mineral
which mineral do we use with the
minerals in limestone we combine those
to make what to make glass it's quartz
right so limestone of course i said
you know the reading passage talked
about sander when the main idea is
talked about sand
but of course sand is little probably
little pieces of
limestone and quartz that are on the
beach right that's
that's the sand and if you look at the
sand you might find little pieces of
quartz
and other minerals that are come that
may have come from limestone
and that if under high pressure or high
temperature
sorry not high pressure high pressure
high temperature
that is used to make glass okay
next we saw another example of a rock
what is a beautiful rock
now the reading passage said that the
beautiful rock is used to make
statues right but i also mentioned it
when we were going over the vocabulary
that many people have it in their homes
on their kitchen countertops and of
course that is
marble it's a very beautiful rock now
there's many different colors
it's amazing really how many different
colors you can get marble in
from black to white to pink to blue
marble comes in many different colors
and also many different patterns so
marble is a beautiful rock
it can be what it can be how
you know when we when we shape wood or
rock
what are we doing we're carving it so it
can be carved
and we need to put ed because it can be
it can be carved to make statues
last our last example we were talking
about a soft mineral and we were using
it
as the example in a pencil right that
you can write with it
it is used to make pencils what mineral
is it it's a soft material
soft mineral we were talking about
graphite
graphite is a black soft mineral that is
on the inside of pencils
whether it's a wooden pencil or a
mechanical pencil
it is the substance that you use to
write with and basically you're putting
pressure on it
you're rubbing it onto the paper and the
mineral is transferring to the paper
and it stays on the paper so even though
it's soft it's not
too soft it's just the right softness
that you can write on a piece of paper
and it doesn't fall off the paper okay
so
as we can see there are many different
rocks and minerals
and throughout thousands of years
throughout our history
we have observed nature we have looked
at these different rocks and minerals
and we've
made in you know human mind is very
creative we have
devised or invented ways to use these
materials
to change their properties using heat or
pressure to make other
substances like concrete to help us
build things build our buildings to put
windows in our house so we can see
outside
so it's not depressing when we're
sitting inside our house we can see
outside
we can let the air in you know we just
move it
move it aside but we can also see we let
the light in
so there's many different rocks and
minerals that we use for many different
purposes of course
copper was one of the examples we use
copper all the time
copper is very good for conducting
electricity so there's a lot of copper
in your house
there's a lot of cut there's copper in
your cell phone there's gold in your
cell phone
as well so a lot of different minerals
and rocks that we use
in everyday life to make our lives
easier so take a look around your home
take a look around your neighborhood
what different rocks and minerals were
used
to make your life more convenient it's
very interesting it's a very interesting
subject to look into
and to learn more about and who knows
maybe one day
you might become a geologist okay so
that would be an interesting career
anyway thanks for uh studying with me as
always
and i hope to see you in the next video
lesson take care everybody
bye bye
you

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:11
textbook reading
00:12
today we're looking at science book 4
00:15
lesson eight
00:16
rocks and minerals rocks and minerals
00:20
you know my dad is a geologist i think
00:22
he should teach this lesson
00:24
but he's not here so let's continue okay
00:26
anyway
00:27
in this lesson you will discover
00:29
different types of rocks
00:31
and minerals and also how
00:34
glass is made okay so let's begin
00:39
okay in our vocabulary list the first
00:42
word
00:42
is bolder bolder when you say this word
00:46
you feel like something big and round
00:48
right bolder
00:49
a boulder of course is a large rounded
00:53
rock made by weathering
00:56
what is weathering well of course
00:58
weather
00:59
it comes from the word weather weather
01:00
is like rain if it's
01:02
sunny that's a certain type of weather
01:04
if it's rainy that's another type of
01:06
weather
01:07
but of course we talked about this in an
01:10
earlier unit
01:11
over a long time rain
01:14
wind snow freezing melting
01:18
can have an effect on rocks and it can
01:21
make
01:21
new rocks and boulders of course big
01:24
pieces of rock
01:26
that are carved really by the wind and
01:28
sometimes by the motion
01:30
of landslides and things like that rocks
01:33
will break up
01:34
and they will become smooth because
01:37
they'll wear away
01:38
and they're round and we call these
01:40
large rocks boulders
01:41
this is a really large rock isn't it
01:44
that's a person standing next to it
01:46
right there
01:47
so imagine how big that rock is so of
01:50
course
01:51
you know boulders can be bigger than you
01:53
know many houses put together
01:55
of course boulders can also be smaller
01:57
but they have to be a certain size i
01:58
mean if you have a rock like this
02:00
that's not a boulder but if you have
02:01
something that's pretty big it's
02:03
heavy to pick up you could call that a
02:05
boulder okay
02:06
but a small rock no that's not a boulder
02:09
it's a large rock
02:10
okay next we have limestone
02:14
now limestone is a gray colored rock
02:17
used in buildings it's a very uh
02:20
uh hard uh rock type of rock of course
02:24
there's many types of rocks
02:25
some rocks are harder than other rocks
02:28
some rocks are very soft and will
02:30
crumble easily but limestone is very
02:33
tough
02:34
and people will use it to make buildings
02:36
because it's tough
02:37
and it doesn't uh crumble or break apart
02:41
easily so that's limestone
02:44
next we have marble now marble is also
02:47
a very strong type of rock but
02:51
it is all it can also be a very
02:53
beautiful type of rock
02:54
it's a hard rock that is shiny when
02:58
cut and polished so usually people will
03:01
cut like
03:02
sheets of marble if they find marble of
03:04
course it's just rock
03:05
underground or sometimes it's exposed
03:07
because of the weather
03:09
but when people will find that they will
03:11
they will
03:12
make it's kind of like a mine but they
03:14
call it a quarry
03:16
a quarry and what they do is they they
03:19
will go in they will
03:20
cut like pieces of rock and you can cut
03:23
like
03:23
square or rectangular slabs
03:27
of marble and then you can use that in
03:29
your building
03:30
a lot of people like to have marble
03:33
countertops
03:34
in their kitchen and of course there are
03:37
many different types many different
03:38
colors
03:39
designs and so and when you polish them
03:43
they look very beautiful of course
03:44
they're very strong and resistant so
03:47
when you know somebody's in the kitchen
03:48
and cutting and cooking and banging pots
03:51
and pans
03:51
it doesn't hurt the marble so many
03:54
people like to use marble
03:55
in their kitchen on top of their
03:57
countertops
03:59
okay next we have mineral
04:02
there are many minerals and minerals are
04:06
found in rocks they are useful
04:08
substances
04:09
use minerals are useful substances if
04:12
it's useful
04:14
it's a type of mineral that is formed
04:16
naturally
04:17
in the ground just like rocks okay so
04:20
minerals are different types of useful
04:23
substances found in the ground what
04:25
kinds of minerals are there well we'll
04:27
find out more
04:28
in the lesson but there are many
04:30
different types
04:32
graphite graphite is a type of mineral
04:36
now what do we use graphite for well
04:38
first of all
04:39
it's soft it's black and it
04:43
it's not a hard rock if you put some
04:45
pressure on it
04:46
little pieces of it will break off and
04:48
in fact
04:49
it's very useful when you think about it
04:52
because if you have a piece of graphite
04:54
you can put wind oh you can put wind you
04:57
can put
04:58
wood around it so you hold it the
05:00
graphite doesn't mark your fingers
05:02
but if the little piece of graphite is
05:03
sticking out the end that of course is a
05:05
pencil
05:06
and you can write with it so when you
05:08
write with a pencil
05:10
you're actually rubbing part of the
05:12
graphite that mineral
05:13
onto the paper and it stays onto the
05:16
paper
05:16
right so it's a very useful mineral
05:19
obviously for
05:20
writing notes or to write messages to
05:23
other people
05:24
and of course we use those in pencils
05:27
and also uh what you what you call um
05:31
what what do they say uh click pen or we
05:34
call it a mechanical pencil
05:36
i forgot what many people sometimes call
05:39
it but it's a mechanical pencil
05:41
when you have just a little thin piece
05:43
of graphite and you put it into a
05:45
it's like a machine a pencil and then
05:47
you just click the button
05:48
and it pushes the pencil or the graphite
05:51
out as you
05:52
write okay so that would be a mechanical
05:54
pencil as well
05:56
next we have quartz now quartz is
05:59
another type of
06:00
mineral and it's a hard mineral that is
06:03
white
06:03
or colorless it's it's actually kind of
06:06
uh
06:08
nice looking many people we use quartz
06:10
to decorate
06:11
things but we also use quartz to do
06:13
something else and we'll talk about that
06:15
in the reading passage okay so that's
06:17
quartz
06:18
and quartz is a very interesting rock
06:20
right it forms these
06:21
crystals now many minerals will form
06:23
what we call
06:25
crystals right
06:28
and it's the chemical it's it's the way
06:30
the molecular structure it now i'm
06:32
getting too deep
06:33
here but the molecular structure of the
06:35
mineral will form itself in a certain
06:37
way
06:37
to make a crystal and that's what we
06:39
have here we have quartz crystals
06:41
in this rock okay concrete
06:46
concrete is a hard building material
06:49
made using limestone so actually the
06:52
romans
06:53
were very famous for uh using and
06:55
developing this technology
06:57
they would use they would make concrete
06:59
they even had concrete that they could
07:01
make
07:01
underwater to build many of the amazing
07:04
buildings that the roman empire built
07:06
both in their city of rome but also
07:09
in you know the aqueducts and other many
07:12
other cities
07:13
in their empire they used concrete
07:16
to build their buildings the hard
07:18
building material and they could shape
07:19
it
07:20
the nice thing about concrete is that
07:22
you can shape it
07:23
into the shape that you want it's wet at
07:25
first and you
07:26
pour it it's like a liquid but a very
07:28
heavy liquid you pour it
07:30
into a shape and then it gets hard and
07:32
then you can use that for bricks
07:34
or columns or really anything
07:38
to make your building with so it's a
07:40
very useful
07:42
building material next we have
07:46
carve carve means to
07:49
make something by cutting into it and
07:52
usually people
07:53
will cut into wood or stone
07:56
of course if you cut into wood you just
07:58
need a sharp knife and be careful
07:59
obviously if you're going to
08:01
carve a figure some people like to carve
08:03
little animals or little people
08:05
out of pieces of wood you could also
08:07
carve a walking stick you can make
08:10
interesting designs with a knife on a
08:12
piece of wood
08:13
but if you cut stone you can't use a
08:16
knife right
08:17
you have to use a hammer and a chisel
08:20
because a knife is not sharp enough to
08:23
cut rock
08:24
but a hammer and a chisel has enough
08:27
force
08:28
to very gently carve away
08:31
the stone and you look this person is a
08:33
very good artist
08:34
they're very skilled because they they
08:36
know how to use the hammer and chisel
08:38
to make very beautiful and detailed
08:41
carvings okay next statue
08:44
of course a statue is a carving made
08:48
out of a rock usually marble
08:51
but you could also make them out of
08:53
stone other types of stone
08:54
or metal even well metal is easier
08:58
because you can heat metal so it's a
09:00
liquid and just pour it
09:02
into a form and then you don't really
09:03
have to carve it but anyway
09:05
an object made in solid material such as
09:08
a stone or metal
09:09
and of course this is probably a very
09:11
famous statue
09:13
looks like greek or roman
09:16
era statue many greeks and romans made
09:20
statues like this of the famous people
09:22
or people who are in legends or myths
09:26
they made statues of them to remind them
09:29
and it's a part of their culture
09:30
it's also a very important art form
09:33
so a statue and we can see many statues
09:36
today
09:36
as well of famous people okay so those
09:40
are our words for the lesson
09:43
now one of the main ideas of this lesson
09:45
of course is that there are many
09:46
different types of rocks and there are
09:48
many different types of minerals
09:50
so what are the different types of rocks
09:52
we looked at we looked at
09:54
boulders we looked at limestone
09:57
and we looked at marble these are all
09:59
different types of rocks
10:01
they aren't minerals they are rocks okay
10:04
and usually these rocks are formed
10:06
over a very long time by pressures
10:10
in the environment boulders are formed
10:12
by wind
10:13
rain movement of the earth
10:17
limestone is formed and marble also
10:20
is formed by many layers of mud
10:24
and silt and things being pressed very
10:26
hard
10:28
by other material on top of it for a
10:30
very long time and becoming a very
10:32
strong
10:33
substance and marble of course is very
10:36
interesting too
10:37
in these rocks that we can cut them into
10:40
shapes
10:40
and use them in our buildings now those
10:43
are rocks
10:44
different types of minerals minerals we
10:47
have quartz
10:49
copper and graphite so we can see oh
10:52
copper
10:53
copper is a metal sure but it's also a
10:55
type of mineral
10:56
so many precious metals like copper gold
10:59
silver
11:00
are types of minerals and so quartz
11:02
copper graphite
11:04
these are different types of minerals
11:08
another idea in this unit is how glass
11:11
is made
11:12
because you think about glass is glass a
11:14
rock
11:15
is it a mineral well actually glass is
11:18
made now
11:18
glass can be made naturally but
11:22
uh if it's made by humans humans can
11:24
make
11:25
glass in a lot of different varieties
11:27
shapes and even colors
11:29
and of course humans have perfected
11:32
the technique or technology of making
11:35
glass
11:36
so we can see glass all around us and we
11:38
use glass and a lot of the objects
11:41
that we use every day so how is it made
11:45
well first of all sand is the basic
11:48
ingredient
11:49
and sand is made of tiny pieces of rock
11:52
so again boulders are big pieces of rock
11:55
made by wind and rain
11:56
but over time that boulder you know the
12:00
wind and the rain
12:01
and the elements will constantly wear
12:04
away the boulder
12:05
and little pieces of that boulder will
12:06
be blown away in the wind
12:08
and that's sand right and a lot of sand
12:10
as well is on the beach also
12:13
because sand is also produced by fish
12:15
eating coral
12:16
right that's another way that sand is
12:18
made
12:19
so sand is made of tiny pieces of rock
12:22
and at high temperature when there's a
12:24
very high temperature
12:26
sand and other ingredients are mixed
12:28
together
12:29
in a very high temperature and when the
12:32
material
12:32
cools it becomes glass
12:36
now it's very interesting that some
12:37
places uh
12:39
where there's a lot of storms and a lot
12:41
of lightning
12:42
people will actually put metal poles in
12:45
the beach
12:46
why do they do that because they want to
12:48
attract lightning
12:49
lightning will hit the metal pole and of
12:51
course it'll make it very hot
12:53
the whole metal pole the metal pole
12:54
that's in the sand will create natural
12:57
glass
12:57
and sometimes if lightning hits the
12:59
beach or in sandy area
13:01
because it's so hot it will turn that
13:03
sand into glass
13:05
that won't be the clear glass in your
13:07
car
13:08
or in your house it'll be you know it
13:10
won't be perfect glass
13:11
but that's how people first discovered
13:13
glass and they perfected it
13:15
to make very useful glass glass that we
13:19
can
13:20
see through or tinted glass or colored
13:22
glass for churches
13:23
to make very beautiful windows so
13:27
basically that's how they make glass so
13:29
they first observed it in nature
13:31
and then they figured out how they could
13:33
develop that
13:34
uh those materials and use you know
13:37
perfect
13:37
the technique to make all sorts of
13:39
different glass and you can see
13:41
you know lots of different designs and
13:43
you can shape glass
13:45
into many different shapes we can make
13:46
cups out of it we can make windshields
13:49
for our cars
13:50
out of it we can make windows for our
13:52
house out of it
13:53
so glass is very useful is a very useful
13:56
material
13:57
oh and by the way one more thing about
13:58
glass i'm sorry i'm going too long but
14:00
do you know glass when they make it it's
14:03
not set
14:04
over time glass is is a solid substance
14:07
but it's a little bit liquid too because
14:11
over a long time hundreds of years
14:14
if you have a piece of glass in a house
14:17
a very old house
14:18
look at that glass at the top of the
14:20
glass it will be
14:21
thinner at the bottom it will be thicker
14:24
because
14:24
slowly slowly slowly over time that
14:27
glass
14:28
is flowing down because of gravity
14:31
so it's not a liquid right but it's
14:34
it's a solid but it's kind of in between
14:38
it's
14:39
it's not it obviously not a liquid but
14:41
over time
14:42
the glass will flow down and the the
14:45
material the glass will flow down
14:46
like a liquid and become thicker at the
14:48
bottom and thinner at the top
14:50
that's just an interesting fact about
14:52
glass interesting huh
14:53
okay anyway let's take a look at the
14:57
reading passage and as usual as i read
15:00
it you know read along with me or read
15:02
along in your mind
15:03
and focus on the words in the from the
15:05
vocabulary you guys ready
15:07
let's begin rocks are everywhere
15:11
on earth rocks can be many shapes
15:15
and sizes boulders
15:18
are large rocks
15:21
boulders can be larger than a house
15:26
we use rocks in many ways
15:31
limestone is a rock limestone
15:34
is used to make concrete concrete
15:38
is used to build houses and roads
15:42
marble is a beautiful rock marble can be
15:46
carved statues are carved
15:50
from marble
15:54
rocks are made up of minerals
15:57
minerals are non-living solids
16:01
there are many types of minerals and
16:04
they have many uses
16:06
quartz copper and graphite
16:09
are minerals
16:12
quartz is found in many rocks and sand
16:17
quartz is used with minerals from
16:19
limestone
16:21
to make glass copper is used to make
16:24
pots quartz and copper
16:27
are hard minerals
16:31
graphite is used to make pencils
16:35
graphite in a pencil is the black part
16:38
we use to write graphite
16:42
is a soft mineral
16:47
okay let's take a look at the reading
16:48
passage and see how the information
16:50
is organized a very common
16:53
organizational method
16:55
is to have the main ideas and then
16:57
details
16:58
to support that main idea what is the
17:01
main idea
17:02
of this reading passage the main idea is
17:04
rocks
17:05
and minerals have many uses
17:08
okay that's a true statement so now
17:10
let's support it
17:12
with evidence with examples
17:15
and details so what's the first
17:18
thing that we use to support that idea
17:20
that rocks and minerals have many uses
17:23
first of all we have we'll have a blank
17:25
beep is used to make
17:27
concrete so what type of rock or mineral
17:30
is used to make
17:31
concrete if you remember from the
17:32
reading passage that
17:34
rock is limestone
17:37
lime stone
17:41
limestone limestone is used to make
17:44
concrete minerals
17:46
in it are also used with another
17:51
substance to make glass in this case
17:53
we're using we're mixing it with a
17:54
mineral
17:55
which mineral do we use with the
17:57
minerals in limestone we combine those
18:00
to make what to make glass it's quartz
18:07
right so limestone of course i said
18:10
you know the reading passage talked
18:11
about sander when the main idea is
18:13
talked about sand
18:14
but of course sand is little probably
18:17
little pieces of
18:18
limestone and quartz that are on the
18:20
beach right that's
18:22
that's the sand and if you look at the
18:23
sand you might find little pieces of
18:25
quartz
18:26
and other minerals that are come that
18:27
may have come from limestone
18:29
and that if under high pressure or high
18:32
temperature
18:32
sorry not high pressure high pressure
18:34
high temperature
18:36
that is used to make glass okay
18:39
next we saw another example of a rock
18:41
what is a beautiful rock
18:43
now the reading passage said that the
18:44
beautiful rock is used to make
18:47
statues right but i also mentioned it
18:50
when we were going over the vocabulary
18:52
that many people have it in their homes
18:54
on their kitchen countertops and of
18:56
course that is
18:57
marble it's a very beautiful rock now
19:00
there's many different colors
19:02
it's amazing really how many different
19:04
colors you can get marble in
19:06
from black to white to pink to blue
19:09
marble comes in many different colors
19:12
and also many different patterns so
19:14
marble is a beautiful rock
19:16
it can be what it can be how
19:19
you know when we when we shape wood or
19:22
rock
19:23
what are we doing we're carving it so it
19:25
can be carved
19:28
and we need to put ed because it can be
19:31
it can be carved to make statues
19:36
last our last example we were talking
19:39
about a soft mineral and we were using
19:41
it
19:42
as the example in a pencil right that
19:45
you can write with it
19:47
it is used to make pencils what mineral
19:50
is it it's a soft material
19:51
soft mineral we were talking about
19:54
graphite
19:56
graphite is a black soft mineral that is
19:59
on the inside of pencils
20:01
whether it's a wooden pencil or a
20:02
mechanical pencil
20:04
it is the substance that you use to
20:06
write with and basically you're putting
20:08
pressure on it
20:08
you're rubbing it onto the paper and the
20:11
mineral is transferring to the paper
20:13
and it stays on the paper so even though
20:15
it's soft it's not
20:16
too soft it's just the right softness
20:18
that you can write on a piece of paper
20:20
and it doesn't fall off the paper okay
20:23
so
20:23
as we can see there are many different
20:25
rocks and minerals
20:27
and throughout thousands of years
20:30
throughout our history
20:31
we have observed nature we have looked
20:33
at these different rocks and minerals
20:35
and we've
20:35
made in you know human mind is very
20:38
creative we have
20:39
devised or invented ways to use these
20:42
materials
20:44
to change their properties using heat or
20:47
pressure to make other
20:50
substances like concrete to help us
20:54
build things build our buildings to put
20:57
windows in our house so we can see
20:58
outside
20:59
so it's not depressing when we're
21:01
sitting inside our house we can see
21:02
outside
21:03
we can let the air in you know we just
21:05
move it
21:06
move it aside but we can also see we let
21:08
the light in
21:09
so there's many different rocks and
21:11
minerals that we use for many different
21:13
purposes of course
21:14
copper was one of the examples we use
21:16
copper all the time
21:17
copper is very good for conducting
21:19
electricity so there's a lot of copper
21:21
in your house
21:22
there's a lot of cut there's copper in
21:24
your cell phone there's gold in your
21:26
cell phone
21:26
as well so a lot of different minerals
21:29
and rocks that we use
21:31
in everyday life to make our lives
21:33
easier so take a look around your home
21:35
take a look around your neighborhood
21:37
what different rocks and minerals were
21:39
used
21:40
to make your life more convenient it's
21:42
very interesting it's a very interesting
21:44
subject to look into
21:45
and to learn more about and who knows
21:48
maybe one day
21:49
you might become a geologist okay so
21:51
that would be an interesting career
21:53
anyway thanks for uh studying with me as
21:56
always
21:57
and i hope to see you in the next video
21:59
lesson take care everybody
22:00
bye bye
22:21
you
