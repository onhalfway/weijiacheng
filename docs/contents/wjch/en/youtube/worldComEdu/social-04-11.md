hello everyone and welcome back to
american textbook reading my name is
brian stewart
and in this lesson we're taking a look
at social studies book
for lesson 11 and lesson 11 is about
making money choices so
in this unit you will discover how to
make plans
to spend money and the difference
between needs and wants
so an important lesson let's get started
the first word in our vocabulary section
is
plan it's very important to
plan ahead to make a plan
to plan in this case you can use it as a
verb by the way
it's more commonly used as a verb but it
can also be a noun for
formal situations plan means to think
about and decide what you will do
so let's plan
something for the weekend let's plan for
our future
do you have any plans for tomorrow
okay that's that's a noun but to plan
means just to think about
ahead of time and to make decisions
before
uh the events occur so that you have a
good idea
and you can kind of control the future
that way that's the whole idea
behind planning for the future
predict predict is to
think about what will
or might happen in the future so you
predict you think about
it's very easy to predict things that
are going to happen tomorrow
or next week it's more difficult to
predict
things that will happen next year of
course we can plan for these things
and that's what we should do we should
think okay what's going to happen
tomorrow i have a test
right so can i predict will i do well on
the test or am i going to do poorly on
the test
so plan ahead study study today
study tonight and in the morning
tomorrow
and then you will be prepared for the
test tomorrow
so you can predict what will happen in
the future
of course we can't predict 100
right but we can plan ahead and we can
uh think about what will happen
next we have give up now give up is
actually a good skill to have
sometimes you have to give things up you
have to make good choices
you may want something or you might like
to do something
but it might be bad for you or it might
be a bad
choice so to give up means to stop doing
something
the example here of course is we have
junk food
and we have healthy food if you like to
eat a lot of junk food
at some point you're going to have to
say okay i have to give up
the junk food stop eating junk food
that's to give it up
and eat the healthier food bananas
apples
oranges of course
pancakes donuts pastries
are good to eat but not too much right
so
give it up maybe a little bit but don't
eat it all the time next
shopper next we have shopper a shopper
is a person er
we form nouns with er to talk about
people who do
things right people who shop are called
shoppers so if you have a verb
which is to shop to go to the store and
buy something
and you make it into a noun that
describes a person
who does this just add er shopper of
course is a person
who buys things from a shop we are all
shoppers at some time in our lives
choice choice is to make a decision
about do i want this or do i want that
so you have to make a decision which one
will you buy
which one will you eat which one will
you use
choosing one thing from among
other things and it's of course it's not
just two things that's a simple example
sometimes it could be you know 10 20
different things
you go into a supermarket there's 20
different brands of milk
which one do i buy you have to make a
decision to choose one
okay
scarce scarce means there's not enough
of something or it's rare rare means
it's not there's not a lot of something
for example gold there's not a lot of
gold you can't just go outside and find
gold in the ground
gold is very rare it is scarce
that's one of the reasons why it is so
valuable
valuable what am i saying valuable
scarce also money unfortunately
is sometimes scarce right we have to
earn
it and be careful about spending it
otherwise as you can see this person
there's no money left just two pennies
so money is scarce
for this person
figure out are you good at figuring
things out i'm sure you are
figure out means to be able to
understand
something so if you're reading a book
maybe it's a book
about math or science or something like
that
and you read it and you understand it
you know you may have to read it a
couple times but then
i understand it you figured it out right
it might be a puzzle
it might be difficult to understand at
first but if you read it a few times if
you listen to the explanation
given by the teacher or you go on the
internet and you read more about it you
say ah
okay i understand now i figured
it out
put aside put aside means to save
something for later and this is a good
example right
this person has some money now they
could spend that money now
hey let's go out to the movies let's buy
some popcorn let's buy some junk food
let's buy a new uh bike or a new toy
that or a new game that i want to play
you could spend that money now or you
could put it aside for the future right
it says now is here
and the future is later right so you put
it aside
you save it for later okay
those are our words for the vocabulary
section
now let's talk about the first main idea
and the main idea is about
money planning and making money choices
it's kind of like
this main idea is about managing your
money
and it says making money choices but we
can also say
managing your
money because of course you know we need
to have money to live in our society
if you want something you have to buy it
but you have to make smart
choices about what you buy you have to
manage
your money well so money planning
it's important to plan how you will
spend your money
you need to of course plan carefully now
many people will make a budget
we didn't have that word but that's an
important word for this unit
a budget is basically a plan to spend
money
and your mom and dad will have a very
detailed budget or they have a
very important budget because they know
how much money they're earning
but they also know how much money they
need to spend
for our rent for uh
services like electricity water gas
how much money they need to spend on
food how much money on gas for their car
so when you set aside and you plan to
spend the money on these different
categories
that is a plan that is called a
budget so plan carefully make
a budget figure out how to use money
right when you make your budget you have
to make decisions okay how much money am
i going to spend
on gas how much money am i going to
spend on food you might
have money that is left over some extra
money
you need to figure out how to use it now
when you choose you when you make
make a choice choice is a noun chooses a
verb right
choice so you make a choice what is your
choice
choose well so difference between choice
noun
choose is a verb so you make a money
choice now you have needs like i said
you have to buy food to eat you have to
pay for rent for your house
you have to pay the electricity bill the
water bill
so you get these things at your house
those are the things that you need
to live your life now some things are
wants
there are things you don't really need
but you want to have and of course we
know what those are right
those are things like hey the kid's like
hey i want that i want that new toy i
want that stuffed animal
he wants it but does he need it no he
doesn't need it
but it would be nice to have and you
know maybe if there's enough money sure
he can get it as a present or
if he does chores around the house maybe
mom says okay you earned it
you can have it so there's a difference
between needs
things you need to live uh things you
need to buy
to live your life and things that you
don't really need but
it would be nice to have and maybe you
have a desire
to own that to play with it to use it
for entertainment
that is a want so needs and wants it's
an
important difference so and this is kind
of covered in these statements down here
first statement
we cannot have everything we want right
we can't go to the store and buy all the
stuffed animals or all the toys or all
the games
we don't have enough money so we need to
make
choices make a choice
when we make choices we have to think
about
how much money we have we have to think
about our needs
and wants if we have to spend money
for our needs we have to spend money for
needs make sure you you buy
what you need that you have enough money
for that but you don't have enough money
to buy everything you want then you will
have to give
up something right you say okay well
maybe i don't need it so i won't buy it
i will
give it up of course you didn't really
have it in the first place but you give
up your desire
you give up your wants okay
so you have to make these decisions
that's part of life
our next main idea again we're talking
about needs and wants in more detail so
as i said before
needs are the things that you need to
live wants
are things that would be nice to have
right that
satisfy a desire or something that you
want to do so what are some more
examples of needs
needs are things we must have to live
you need clothes well you don't need
clothing to live but
if you don't have clothing you're going
to have a very difficult time
in society okay so you need clothing
of course you need shelter for
protection from the weather and the
elements
you need food you have to be able to eat
and water you need to be able to drink
and take a shower
those are needs okay those are things
you need
to live in society you need them you
can't decide to
go without them you absolutely need them
now wants are things we want to have
we don't need these things to live right
you don't need a stuffed animal to live
you could go through life without a
stuffed animal you don't need
ice skates to live sure they're fun
and they're good exercise but you don't
need them
but maybe you want to go ice skating and
this is a cell phone now
you don't i hate to tell you but you
don't need
a cell phone to live of course everybody
has one
and many people will will argue with me
no i need my cell phone
okay so yeah but you don't actually
really need it to live
of course it makes life easier and it is
important to have for emergency
situations and staying in touch with
your family
members or your friends but you don't
really need it
it is more of a want okay so these are
needs
and wants okay let's go over the reading
section together
as usual i will read it out loud you
guys repeat after me
or just repeat in your brain and think
about the pronunciation the words
and also focus on the vocabulary that we
studied are you guys ready
let's begin when we think about
what we need to buy we have to
plan carefully each month
we should think about the money we have
we can figure out how to use
money for our needs and wants
needs are things we must have
to live clothing shelter
food and water are needs
wants are things we want to have
we can predict how much money we will
need for groceries
and other needs and we can put aside
some money for savings
sometimes we should give up what we want
a good shopper will make smart choices
so they can buy the best food at the
lowest price
money is sometimes scarce
but it is the job of every shopper
to think carefully about what
they are going to buy
okay
how is the information in this reading
passage
organized here we have main idea and
details to support
that main idea so the main idea again
main ideas are usually
general they're more vague they're not
very specific they're just a general
statement
and the general statement here is we
have to beep
carefully when we think about what to
buy
and we talked about this i talked about
this quite often and also the reading
passage mentioned this
that we have to you know when you make a
budget what are you doing
when you make a budget you are planning
right you're planning
how to spend your money so we have to
plan
carefully when we think about what to
buy remember a budget
is a plan to spend money so we have to
plan
carefully when we think about what to
buy
we can figure out how to use money
for our beep and wants so we talked
about this i talked about this quite
often right
we have wants what we want to buy but we
also have the things that we
absolutely have to have in order to live
and those things of course are needs so
we can think about
needs and wants needs what do we have to
have
wants what would be nice to have but we
don't really need it
okay next we can beep
how much money will be needed so
remember when we talked about
thinking about the future right we know
okay the gas bill
every month is maybe 200
so next month it's going to be 200 we
can think in the future
and we can guess we can make a very good
guess because of our past experience
and that of course means that we can
predict
predict we can predict
how much money will be needed so we're
going to need 200
for gas next month don't spend that
money
right save it for the gas bill next
money so
we can beep some money for savings so
it's important this is a very important
concept a very important idea
you know you have to buy things that you
need like i said the gas you need to pay
for water you need to pay for food
you need to pay for clothing but after
you
spend money for all those things
hopefully you have
some money left what do you do with it
it's a good idea to
put it aside in this case we can put
aside
we can put aside some money for savings
by the way put aside is like a separable
verb you could also say
put money
aside so you can separate the two parts
of the verb
with the the the object the noun that
you're talking about
put money aside or put aside money
either way
in this case we can put aside some money
for
savings that's an important idea right
you want to save money
for the future you might have needs in
the future that you didn't predict
and because we want to put aside some
money for the future
sometimes we should beep what we want so
we want it but we say no
i want to save money i want to put it
aside so i'm going to
give up give
up what we want okay
and again give up is another verb like
this you can say give
the toy up
or just give it up we could also do that
so give up what we want
we can give what we want up but it's
better to say give up what we want
keep it together in that case okay so
this is an important lesson it's
important lesson for your life obviously
to think about how to manage money now
you may not have a lot of money right
now
but maybe your mom gives you some money
for allowance we
we talk about we didn't have that word
but in your case this is an important
word
allowance is the money that your parents
give you every week every two weeks or
maybe every month
hopefully they give it to you because
you do work around the house right you
clean up you
get good grades so your parents might
give you some money we call that
allowance manage that money well
what do you need what do you want now
there are some things maybe you want
that you could spend your money on
but think about your future maybe
there's something in the future that you
want more it's more expensive save your
money for
that situation when you get older you
get a job
you're making income we talked about
that in the last lesson
you have to manage your money well so be
careful start thinking about how to
manage money now
make that a skill right be good at it
because it's a very important thing for
your life okay
well i hope you learned a lot of good
words in this lesson and some
good ideas thanks for studying with me
as always and we'll see you in the next
video lesson i hope take care everybody
bye bye

hello everyone and welcome back to
00:10
american textbook reading my name is
00:12
brian stewart
00:13
and in this lesson we're taking a look
00:15
at social studies book
00:16
for lesson 11 and lesson 11 is about
00:20
making money choices so
00:24
in this unit you will discover how to
00:26
make plans
00:28
to spend money and the difference
00:31
between needs and wants
00:35
so an important lesson let's get started
00:42
the first word in our vocabulary section
00:44
is
00:45
plan it's very important to
00:49
plan ahead to make a plan
00:53
to plan in this case you can use it as a
00:55
verb by the way
00:57
it's more commonly used as a verb but it
01:00
can also be a noun for
01:02
formal situations plan means to think
01:05
about and decide what you will do
01:09
so let's plan
01:13
something for the weekend let's plan for
01:16
our future
01:17
do you have any plans for tomorrow
01:21
okay that's that's a noun but to plan
01:24
means just to think about
01:25
ahead of time and to make decisions
01:27
before
01:28
uh the events occur so that you have a
01:31
good idea
01:32
and you can kind of control the future
01:34
that way that's the whole idea
01:36
behind planning for the future
01:42
predict predict is to
01:45
think about what will
01:48
or might happen in the future so you
01:52
predict you think about
01:54
it's very easy to predict things that
01:55
are going to happen tomorrow
01:57
or next week it's more difficult to
01:59
predict
02:00
things that will happen next year of
02:02
course we can plan for these things
02:04
and that's what we should do we should
02:05
think okay what's going to happen
02:06
tomorrow i have a test
02:08
right so can i predict will i do well on
02:11
the test or am i going to do poorly on
02:13
the test
02:14
so plan ahead study study today
02:17
study tonight and in the morning
02:19
tomorrow
02:20
and then you will be prepared for the
02:22
test tomorrow
02:23
so you can predict what will happen in
02:25
the future
02:26
of course we can't predict 100
02:30
right but we can plan ahead and we can
02:33
uh think about what will happen
02:37
next we have give up now give up is
02:40
actually a good skill to have
02:41
sometimes you have to give things up you
02:43
have to make good choices
02:45
you may want something or you might like
02:47
to do something
02:48
but it might be bad for you or it might
02:51
be a bad
02:51
choice so to give up means to stop doing
02:54
something
02:55
the example here of course is we have
02:57
junk food
02:58
and we have healthy food if you like to
03:01
eat a lot of junk food
03:03
at some point you're going to have to
03:04
say okay i have to give up
03:06
the junk food stop eating junk food
03:09
that's to give it up
03:10
and eat the healthier food bananas
03:13
apples
03:13
oranges of course
03:17
pancakes donuts pastries
03:20
are good to eat but not too much right
03:23
so
03:24
give it up maybe a little bit but don't
03:27
eat it all the time next
03:30
shopper next we have shopper a shopper
03:32
is a person er
03:35
we form nouns with er to talk about
03:38
people who do
03:40
things right people who shop are called
03:43
shoppers so if you have a verb
03:44
which is to shop to go to the store and
03:47
buy something
03:48
and you make it into a noun that
03:50
describes a person
03:51
who does this just add er shopper of
03:54
course is a person
03:55
who buys things from a shop we are all
03:58
shoppers at some time in our lives
04:04
choice choice is to make a decision
04:07
about do i want this or do i want that
04:10
so you have to make a decision which one
04:13
will you buy
04:14
which one will you eat which one will
04:16
you use
04:17
choosing one thing from among
04:20
other things and it's of course it's not
04:22
just two things that's a simple example
04:24
sometimes it could be you know 10 20
04:27
different things
04:28
you go into a supermarket there's 20
04:30
different brands of milk
04:32
which one do i buy you have to make a
04:34
decision to choose one
04:36
okay
04:39
scarce scarce means there's not enough
04:42
of something or it's rare rare means
04:45
it's not there's not a lot of something
04:49
for example gold there's not a lot of
04:50
gold you can't just go outside and find
04:52
gold in the ground
04:54
gold is very rare it is scarce
04:57
that's one of the reasons why it is so
05:00
valuable
05:01
valuable what am i saying valuable
05:04
scarce also money unfortunately
05:06
is sometimes scarce right we have to
05:09
earn
05:10
it and be careful about spending it
05:12
otherwise as you can see this person
05:15
there's no money left just two pennies
05:18
so money is scarce
05:19
for this person
05:22
figure out are you good at figuring
05:24
things out i'm sure you are
05:26
figure out means to be able to
05:28
understand
05:29
something so if you're reading a book
05:32
maybe it's a book
05:32
about math or science or something like
05:35
that
05:36
and you read it and you understand it
05:38
you know you may have to read it a
05:39
couple times but then
05:41
i understand it you figured it out right
05:44
it might be a puzzle
05:45
it might be difficult to understand at
05:48
first but if you read it a few times if
05:50
you listen to the explanation
05:52
given by the teacher or you go on the
05:54
internet and you read more about it you
05:56
say ah
05:56
okay i understand now i figured
06:00
it out
06:04
put aside put aside means to save
06:08
something for later and this is a good
06:10
example right
06:11
this person has some money now they
06:13
could spend that money now
06:15
hey let's go out to the movies let's buy
06:17
some popcorn let's buy some junk food
06:19
let's buy a new uh bike or a new toy
06:22
that or a new game that i want to play
06:26
you could spend that money now or you
06:28
could put it aside for the future right
06:30
it says now is here
06:32
and the future is later right so you put
06:35
it aside
06:35
you save it for later okay
06:40
those are our words for the vocabulary
06:42
section
06:46
now let's talk about the first main idea
06:48
and the main idea is about
06:50
money planning and making money choices
06:52
it's kind of like
06:54
this main idea is about managing your
06:56
money
06:57
and it says making money choices but we
06:59
can also say
07:00
managing your
07:04
money because of course you know we need
07:07
to have money to live in our society
07:09
if you want something you have to buy it
07:12
but you have to make smart
07:13
choices about what you buy you have to
07:17
manage
07:17
your money well so money planning
07:21
it's important to plan how you will
07:24
spend your money
07:25
you need to of course plan carefully now
07:28
many people will make a budget
07:30
we didn't have that word but that's an
07:32
important word for this unit
07:34
a budget is basically a plan to spend
07:37
money
07:37
and your mom and dad will have a very
07:40
detailed budget or they have a
07:42
very important budget because they know
07:44
how much money they're earning
07:45
but they also know how much money they
07:47
need to spend
07:48
for our rent for uh
07:53
services like electricity water gas
07:56
how much money they need to spend on
07:57
food how much money on gas for their car
08:00
so when you set aside and you plan to
08:03
spend the money on these different
08:04
categories
08:05
that is a plan that is called a
08:09
budget so plan carefully make
08:12
a budget figure out how to use money
08:16
right when you make your budget you have
08:19
to make decisions okay how much money am
08:21
i going to spend
08:22
on gas how much money am i going to
08:24
spend on food you might
08:26
have money that is left over some extra
08:28
money
08:29
you need to figure out how to use it now
08:31
when you choose you when you make
08:34
make a choice choice is a noun chooses a
08:37
verb right
08:38
choice so you make a choice what is your
08:41
choice
08:43
choose well so difference between choice
08:45
noun
08:46
choose is a verb so you make a money
08:49
choice now you have needs like i said
08:52
you have to buy food to eat you have to
08:55
pay for rent for your house
08:56
you have to pay the electricity bill the
08:59
water bill
09:00
so you get these things at your house
09:02
those are the things that you need
09:04
to live your life now some things are
09:07
wants
09:07
there are things you don't really need
09:09
but you want to have and of course we
09:11
know what those are right
09:13
those are things like hey the kid's like
09:15
hey i want that i want that new toy i
09:17
want that stuffed animal
09:18
he wants it but does he need it no he
09:21
doesn't need it
09:22
but it would be nice to have and you
09:24
know maybe if there's enough money sure
09:26
he can get it as a present or
09:28
if he does chores around the house maybe
09:30
mom says okay you earned it
09:32
you can have it so there's a difference
09:34
between needs
09:35
things you need to live uh things you
09:38
need to buy
09:39
to live your life and things that you
09:41
don't really need but
09:43
it would be nice to have and maybe you
09:45
have a desire
09:46
to own that to play with it to use it
09:50
for entertainment
09:51
that is a want so needs and wants it's
09:54
an
09:54
important difference so and this is kind
09:58
of covered in these statements down here
10:00
first statement
10:01
we cannot have everything we want right
10:04
we can't go to the store and buy all the
10:06
stuffed animals or all the toys or all
10:08
the games
10:09
we don't have enough money so we need to
10:12
make
10:12
choices make a choice
10:16
when we make choices we have to think
10:19
about
10:20
how much money we have we have to think
10:23
about our needs
10:24
and wants if we have to spend money
10:28
for our needs we have to spend money for
10:30
needs make sure you you buy
10:32
what you need that you have enough money
10:33
for that but you don't have enough money
10:36
to buy everything you want then you will
10:38
have to give
10:39
up something right you say okay well
10:42
maybe i don't need it so i won't buy it
10:44
i will
10:45
give it up of course you didn't really
10:46
have it in the first place but you give
10:48
up your desire
10:49
you give up your wants okay
10:52
so you have to make these decisions
10:54
that's part of life
10:57
our next main idea again we're talking
10:59
about needs and wants in more detail so
11:01
as i said before
11:03
needs are the things that you need to
11:04
live wants
11:06
are things that would be nice to have
11:08
right that
11:09
satisfy a desire or something that you
11:12
want to do so what are some more
11:14
examples of needs
11:16
needs are things we must have to live
11:20
you need clothes well you don't need
11:21
clothing to live but
11:23
if you don't have clothing you're going
11:25
to have a very difficult time
11:27
in society okay so you need clothing
11:30
of course you need shelter for
11:32
protection from the weather and the
11:33
elements
11:34
you need food you have to be able to eat
11:36
and water you need to be able to drink
11:38
and take a shower
11:40
those are needs okay those are things
11:43
you need
11:44
to live in society you need them you
11:47
can't decide to
11:48
go without them you absolutely need them
11:53
now wants are things we want to have
11:56
we don't need these things to live right
11:58
you don't need a stuffed animal to live
12:01
you could go through life without a
12:03
stuffed animal you don't need
12:05
ice skates to live sure they're fun
12:09
and they're good exercise but you don't
12:11
need them
12:12
but maybe you want to go ice skating and
12:15
this is a cell phone now
12:17
you don't i hate to tell you but you
12:20
don't need
12:21
a cell phone to live of course everybody
12:23
has one
12:24
and many people will will argue with me
12:26
no i need my cell phone
12:28
okay so yeah but you don't actually
12:30
really need it to live
12:32
of course it makes life easier and it is
12:35
important to have for emergency
12:37
situations and staying in touch with
12:38
your family
12:39
members or your friends but you don't
12:41
really need it
12:43
it is more of a want okay so these are
12:46
needs
12:46
and wants okay let's go over the reading
12:49
section together
12:50
as usual i will read it out loud you
12:53
guys repeat after me
12:54
or just repeat in your brain and think
12:57
about the pronunciation the words
12:59
and also focus on the vocabulary that we
13:01
studied are you guys ready
13:03
let's begin when we think about
13:06
what we need to buy we have to
13:10
plan carefully each month
13:13
we should think about the money we have
13:19
we can figure out how to use
13:22
money for our needs and wants
13:26
needs are things we must have
13:29
to live clothing shelter
13:33
food and water are needs
13:39
wants are things we want to have
13:43
we can predict how much money we will
13:46
need for groceries
13:48
and other needs and we can put aside
13:52
some money for savings
13:56
sometimes we should give up what we want
14:00
a good shopper will make smart choices
14:04
so they can buy the best food at the
14:07
lowest price
14:10
money is sometimes scarce
14:14
but it is the job of every shopper
14:18
to think carefully about what
14:21
they are going to buy
14:24
okay
14:27
how is the information in this reading
14:30
passage
14:31
organized here we have main idea and
14:34
details to support
14:36
that main idea so the main idea again
14:39
main ideas are usually
14:40
general they're more vague they're not
14:42
very specific they're just a general
14:44
statement
14:45
and the general statement here is we
14:47
have to beep
14:48
carefully when we think about what to
14:51
buy
14:52
and we talked about this i talked about
14:53
this quite often and also the reading
14:55
passage mentioned this
14:56
that we have to you know when you make a
14:58
budget what are you doing
15:00
when you make a budget you are planning
15:02
right you're planning
15:04
how to spend your money so we have to
15:06
plan
15:09
carefully when we think about what to
15:11
buy remember a budget
15:12
is a plan to spend money so we have to
15:16
plan
15:16
carefully when we think about what to
15:19
buy
15:22
we can figure out how to use money
15:26
for our beep and wants so we talked
15:28
about this i talked about this quite
15:29
often right
15:31
we have wants what we want to buy but we
15:33
also have the things that we
15:35
absolutely have to have in order to live
15:39
and those things of course are needs so
15:42
we can think about
15:44
needs and wants needs what do we have to
15:47
have
15:48
wants what would be nice to have but we
15:50
don't really need it
15:52
okay next we can beep
15:55
how much money will be needed so
15:58
remember when we talked about
15:59
thinking about the future right we know
16:02
okay the gas bill
16:03
every month is maybe 200
16:07
so next month it's going to be 200 we
16:10
can think in the future
16:12
and we can guess we can make a very good
16:14
guess because of our past experience
16:16
and that of course means that we can
16:18
predict
16:20
predict we can predict
16:24
how much money will be needed so we're
16:26
going to need 200
16:27
for gas next month don't spend that
16:30
money
16:31
right save it for the gas bill next
16:34
money so
16:36
we can beep some money for savings so
16:39
it's important this is a very important
16:41
concept a very important idea
16:43
you know you have to buy things that you
16:45
need like i said the gas you need to pay
16:46
for water you need to pay for food
16:49
you need to pay for clothing but after
16:51
you
16:52
spend money for all those things
16:54
hopefully you have
16:55
some money left what do you do with it
16:58
it's a good idea to
17:00
put it aside in this case we can put
17:03
aside
17:08
we can put aside some money for savings
17:11
by the way put aside is like a separable
17:13
verb you could also say
17:15
put money
17:19
aside so you can separate the two parts
17:23
of the verb
17:24
with the the the object the noun that
17:27
you're talking about
17:27
put money aside or put aside money
17:30
either way
17:31
in this case we can put aside some money
17:34
for
17:34
savings that's an important idea right
17:36
you want to save money
17:38
for the future you might have needs in
17:40
the future that you didn't predict
17:44
and because we want to put aside some
17:47
money for the future
17:49
sometimes we should beep what we want so
17:52
we want it but we say no
17:53
i want to save money i want to put it
17:55
aside so i'm going to
17:57
give up give
18:00
up what we want okay
18:03
and again give up is another verb like
18:05
this you can say give
18:07
the toy up
18:11
or just give it up we could also do that
18:14
so give up what we want
18:15
we can give what we want up but it's
18:18
better to say give up what we want
18:19
keep it together in that case okay so
18:22
this is an important lesson it's
18:24
important lesson for your life obviously
18:26
to think about how to manage money now
18:29
you may not have a lot of money right
18:30
now
18:31
but maybe your mom gives you some money
18:32
for allowance we
18:34
we talk about we didn't have that word
18:36
but in your case this is an important
18:38
word
18:39
allowance is the money that your parents
18:42
give you every week every two weeks or
18:45
maybe every month
18:46
hopefully they give it to you because
18:48
you do work around the house right you
18:49
clean up you
18:50
get good grades so your parents might
18:53
give you some money we call that
18:54
allowance manage that money well
18:57
what do you need what do you want now
19:00
there are some things maybe you want
19:01
that you could spend your money on
19:03
but think about your future maybe
19:05
there's something in the future that you
19:07
want more it's more expensive save your
19:10
money for
19:11
that situation when you get older you
19:13
get a job
19:14
you're making income we talked about
19:16
that in the last lesson
19:18
you have to manage your money well so be
19:20
careful start thinking about how to
19:22
manage money now
19:24
make that a skill right be good at it
19:28
because it's a very important thing for
19:30
your life okay
19:31
well i hope you learned a lot of good
19:33
words in this lesson and some
19:35
