[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary
are you ready to begin studying the
topic for today
is kind of interesting and you've
probably experienced it
in your life right we're talking about a
home
away from home a home away from home
we're going to focus on moving to
a new home have you ever moved in your
life
right did you move to a new apartment or
a new house
maybe you moved to a new neighborhood or
a new city
or maybe even a new country right
so people nowadays move a lot right
you think about it uh and you know sir
there are some people who live in one
place all their life
but it's becoming more and more common
for people to move
to different places and live in a few
different places when they grew up
i probably am a very extreme example of
that
by the time i finished high school i had
moved about
five times my family moved about five
times
why because my father is a jiji
right a geologist a geologist so his
company
sent him giallo just a geologist
his company sent him to many different
places in the world
so when i was growing up you know i
lived in new mexico
wisconsin north carolina papua new
guinea
colorado arizona nevada
we moved so many different times because
of my dad's job
so maybe your dad's job or your mom's
job takes you to different places
or maybe when you go to school when you
go to college you might go to another
city or maybe even a different country
by the way if you get a chance to go to
another country
to study for college take that chance
look for that opportunity it's a very
good experience for you
anyway that's the topic moving to new
homes so
nowadays it's not unusual for us to
think of any place can be a new home
we can move just about anywhere and live
anywhere
so that's what we're going to read about
but first let's take a look at the
vocabulary
our first word is new york
loves ugly that's not our first word
it's just an interesting t-shirt
a person whose home is in a certain area
so new york of course is a
very famous town they're very famous for
their spirit
right uh people who live in new york
they can call themselves
citizens of new york okay usually though
we use citizen for country
for example people who live in new york
are citizens of america
they are american citizens people who
live in seoul
are usually korean citizens right
if you're if your passport has the name
of the country
on it right you were a citizen of that
country if you have a korean passport
you are a citizen of korea if you are
have an american passport
you are a citizen of america and the
same for every country
in the world so which country are you a
citizen
of okay next one
do you know this place machu picchu
right
this is an event that a person goes
through if you go visit a world famous
place like this
uh what do you say it's an
up an experience an experience
so if you go and see machu picchu in
peru or you go see the
pyramids in egypt or you go see the
eiffel tower
in paris france that is an experience
that you will remember experience
experience experience
experience okay so
probably you have good experiences of
traveling maybe your family has taken
vacations
to different places right you have good
experiences
of your traveling next one to fit in
naturally to fit in naturally means to
belong
of course these apples do they belong
together you might say well the red one
doesn't belong
but maybe it does it depends on how you
look at it
they're all apples right so it belongs
together
because they're all apples but maybe
other people say it doesn't belong
because
it's red and the others are green but to
fit in naturally means to belong
somewhere it belongs with the others
of course if you go to the supermarket
apples are in one section sure you have
green apples red apples
yellow apples in different places but
they're all together kind of in the same
area they belong in the same area
this is a interesting idea do you know
this
for a type of living thing to change
slowly over time so
we think about this when you think about
the
the age of the earth how old is the
earth
right 4.5 billion
years old we can't even imagine that
time
how long has life been on earth since
at least 3.5 billion years right now
over that long time life has changed
into many different
forms what do we call that process this
is usually the the picture that they
usually show
how accurate it is you know maybe we
don't know
but it shows that monkey-like
creatures changing slowly into human
beings
we say evolve now of course
monkeys did not evolve into human beings
monkeys are cousins to human beings this
creature
doesn't live anymore it's extinct it's
gone
but all living creatures have evolved
over time
into different forms and shapes if you
look at horses
uh go back and look at the evolutionary
history of horses or
very interesting look at whales it's
very interesting how whales
their ancestors came on land and then
went back to the sea
they evolved they changed over time so
it's a very interesting
um uh idea about the world
and it was first evolution was first
proposed by
darwin charles darwin in 1860 something
i can't remember the exact date
but of course his his idea was very
controversial but nowadays most
scientists more than 90 percent of
scientists
say that this is fact it's not a theory
anymore it it actually happened and when
you think about it it makes sense
okay so evolve okay so next one to
create copies of oneself
so when a when adults
animals have babies what are they doing
they are
reproducing so mama mama sheep will have
a baby sheep right a lamb okay so
reproduce
reproduce reproduce reproduce means to
make copies
of oneself okay so when
animals grow up they become older they
become adults then they can reproduce
and have babies of their own next one
to increase okay so something is
increasing
what does it mean it means rise so we
can see a rise
usually we use this for charts when
we're you know you see business people
using uh this type of graph for to show
an increase in sales perhaps
so they say there's been a rise in sales
okay
a rise to increase rise is a verb by the
way
but also a noun because i said there has
been arise but you could also say
sales have risen okay
rise rose risen because as a verb
rise rises irregular we say rise
rose risen okay but sometimes
rise can also be a noun okay next one
wow this is a very probably european
city
very colorful very interesting place but
if you look at it you also get the
impression
there's so many people there wow it's
really a lot of
people so to fill with animals or people
is to populate populate
populate so you know a long time ago
there weren't that many people but
people you know
increased the numbers of people
increased and increased the numbers of
people
rose and the earth was populated with
human beings
okay and of course all sorts of other
types of animals
next one a group of people sharing
certain traits and beliefs
if we look at the american indian here
we know that american indians
share certain beliefs and behaviors they
do the same things and they believe
many different things of course
different tribes have different beliefs
i'm not saying all american indians are
the same that's not true
but a certain group certain tribes like
the apache or the cherokee
or the mohican right they would have in
their tribes they would have the same
beliefs of the same traditions
and of course the same is true with
countries korean culture
well i gave just gave you the exam the
answer culture
it's a group of people who share the
same beliefs
and behaviors actually culture
when you think about it culture isn't
really you don't say culture as people
say culture is the beliefs or behaviors
of a certain group of people right it's
what they do
so korean culture is different from
american culture
which is different from french culture
okay
so different areas different groups of
people have
different culture or different cultures
okay next one number nine standing
straight
not upside down so if you're standing
straight up right
you are upright up right
now this is important of course when
you're shipping something if you're
sending something in the mail
you write on one side of the package or
this side up
right you want it to be upright you
don't want it to be upside down
because that could be that could
possibly damage what you have in the
container
also it's more natural for us to be
upright right when we're walking around
we don't walk around on our hands upside
down that
makes our head hurt okay next one ten
a group of people living and working
together so a group of people
living and working together what do we
call them
we call that society and we don't
society is a singular
noun okay society so not it not them but
it what do we call a group of people
living and work together what do we call
it we call it society and societies have
different sizes
right a society can be as small as your
family but
usually we talk about society in terms
of like
as big as a city or as big as a nation
or
sometimes a global society so the entire
human population in the world we can
also think of it
as a society it depends on what our
purpose is what is our intention
do we just want to focus on a small
group or are we talking about
issues that affect a very big group so
society when we think about it can be
small
or big but usually we think about it as
the society in which we live
right what is the uh you know the
the behavior or the beliefs or the
customs
the culture of the people that we're
living in with what is the size of
society
and of course what are the laws of
society that's something we have to uh
think about it
as well the laws uh what do we have to
do to obey the laws
what are the expectations of society
what are we expected to do in society
so society is basically the group of
people
in which we live okay 11.
well what's wrong with these people they
look very strange
they have really long legs the the idea
here is for most of the time
for most of the time we say generally
generally so if we talk about basketball
players we can make
general statements most of the time
basketball players are very tall
they have very long legs that look like
golf clubs i'm sorry
no they don't but usually basketball
players are very tall
generally not all sometimes you can find
short basketball players who are very
good
at passing the ball or getting the ball
down the court but
generally usually
for most of the time basketball players
are very tall and we can make general
statements about different groups of
people
but again be careful about making
general statements
because you can always find exceptions
right it's not always the same
okay next one a long period of almost no
food
so these people are looking for food and
they
endure a long period when there no food
has been grown maybe it's too hot
there's no
water so they can't grow food we call
that
time a famine famine is a period of time
that no food is available a long time
ago of course
when people couldn't grow crops or there
were no animals
to hunt right it was too hot there was
no water no food so we call that period
of famine nowadays of course
famines can be caused by the supply
chain breaking down right
people getting food to a certain place
and that could also cause a famine
next one wanting to know more so this
little boy is very curious
most children are very curious generally
children are very curious
about the world around them they are
curious they want to know more about the
world
okay next one to run away from run
right there's a bull i don't know if you
can see you can't see the head but this
is a bull with big horns
and these guys i think they're in spain
perhaps pamplona
where they have every year they run away
from the bowl which is crazy you know a
bunch of people will get ready they'll
release a bull
and these guys will run down the street
running away from a bull
why okay well different people have
different
hobbies i guess okay so to run away from
means to
flee to flee to run away now flea is an
irregular verb so we say flee
fled fled flea fled fled
these men fled from the bowl okay they
are fleeing
from the bowl okay next one to come
from a source now to come from a source
it means descend to descend and we're
talking about evolution here it's a
strange picture
but i think what they're getting at is
that on a chain right there's a watch
that descends from the chain
but to come from a source we can also
think think about the word
evolution remember the picture evolution
we saw the monkey type creature
and then we saw a human being so
usually when we especially talk about
evolution we say that
the modern creatures the modern animals
have descended
from a previous animal usually
not always but generally these animals
are extinct they don't longer live that
we can't see them
nowadays sometimes they they still exist
in certain cases
but usually our ancestors are extinct
right there are no more uh early humans
that are alive people have to go and dig
up their bones right
for the ancestors of human beings but we
descend
from some source from a source every
living thing has descended from
one source okay next one
in a single group so in a single group
we can say together
so if the dog and the cat are in a
single group they look like they're
friends that's very interesting picture
uh they're together right they're
together they're pals they're buddies
they're together in a group okay so
you're together with your friends
probably when you go out to play you're
together in a group
okay let's go over the words and see how
well you remember the vocabulary
number one hang gliding remember hang
gliding from a previous lesson right
that's where you're flying
soaring through the air onto bar with a
wing above you
hang gliding is a great what a citizen
b bridge c experience d culture
which word fits well is hank glenning a
great citizen it's a citizen of a
country
that doesn't make sense is it a great
bridge
that doesn't make sense either is it a
great experience
remember an experience is something that
you remember it's a memorable
happening in your life something an
event or something that happens in your
life
that's a great experience so hang
gliding is a great experience
isn't it because wow that'd be great i
haven't done it yet i would like to
someday
but it would be a great experience and d
of course hang gliding is not a great
culture that doesn't make sense
hang gliding something you do an event
that you remember
it's a great experience or it's an
experience
number three modern birds beep from
dinosaurs
okay there's actually two words from the
vocabulary list that we could use here
but only one of those is here thank
goodness because if both of them were
here
we would have to choose both but there's
only one so a
populated b evolved c reproduced
and d created let me tell you the word
that
could fit here but not on the answer
list and that of course
is descend we could use descended
descended modern birds descended from
dinosaurs
that would fit but it's not one of our
choices but remember when i was
describing or
explaining the meaning of this word
descend we just did this right a couple
slides ago or i think was the last word
descend
i said i gave you the example of right
all living three all living things
descended from
a previous animal and we saw that
diagram
we saw that idea with which word of
course it was with evolved
evolve so we could use either word
modern birds evolved from dinosaurs or
modern birds
descended from dinosaurs it means the
same thing
not populated not reproduced not created
those don't fit we're talking about you
know a previous life
form or a previous type of animal that
gives
birth that reproduces but over a long
time and
changes into another type of animal
and that's evolution that's also
descending from
another species or another type of
animal
so modern bird modern birds evolve from
dinosaurs and by the way that's a very
interesting
idea if you think oh dinosaurs are no
longer in the world they're all extinct
not true birds are a type of dinosaur
and we can see them every day very
interesting okay
five school is strange i don't feel like
i
what i don't feel like i if you think
school is strange
you don't what i don't feel like i what
i don't feel like i a belong b make c
empty d slip so if you think some place
is strange or a group of people is
strange
you don't fit in right you don't
belong i don't feel like i belong
maybe you do belong but you don't feel
like i belong that's too bad
you have to make some friends if you
make friends you get used to the people
there
you find out oh they're good people then
you feel like you belong in a place
right
but if you feel strange about the people
you're with
you don't feel like you have anything in
common it's hard to talk to them
then you feel like you don't belong okay
not make not empty not slip those don't
make sense
the best one is belong seven
south america has a really interesting
what immigration
bee culture sea famine or d hat well
famine is not interesting it's terrible
it's horrible
so that doesn't work right it has has a
really interesting hat
just one south america has an
interesting hat it's a really big hat
that it puts on the whole continent
now that's crazy right has an
interesting immigration
we don't think of immigration as being
interesting we think of immigration as
being a pain in the butt
right it's very difficult right so the
only one
south america has a really interesting
culture that would fit
because the beliefs and the customs in
south america
are very interesting but by the way
south america has many different
countries in south america
and of course there are different
cultures in each of those different
countries
and maybe even inside those countries
there might be different cultures inside
the country
so south america has really interesting
cultures
would be more accurate right but you
could if you're talking about
although the culture of the the same
beliefs and
behaviors that all people from south
america seem to
generally a show then that could be
possible too but it'd be more accurate
to say there are many different cultures
in south america and those cultures are
interesting
okay that wraps up the vocabulary
section of
this lesson let's take a short break
we'll come back and look at the reading

00:50
there are some people who live in one
00:52
place all their life
00:53
but it's becoming more and more common
00:55
for people to move
00:56
to different places and live in a few
00:58
different places when they grew up
01:00
i probably am a very extreme example of
01:04
that
01:05
by the time i finished high school i had
01:08
moved about
01:09
five times my family moved about five
01:12
times
01:13
why because my father is a jiji
01:16
right a geologist a geologist so his
01:19
company
01:21
sent him giallo just a geologist
01:24
his company sent him to many different
01:26
places in the world
01:27
so when i was growing up you know i
01:30
lived in new mexico
01:31
wisconsin north carolina papua new
01:35
guinea
01:36
colorado arizona nevada
01:39
we moved so many different times because
01:42
of my dad's job
01:43
so maybe your dad's job or your mom's
01:45
job takes you to different places
01:47
or maybe when you go to school when you
01:49
go to college you might go to another

by the way if you get a chance to go to
01:56
another country
01:57
to study for college take that chance
02:00
look for that opportunity it's a very
02:02
good experience for you
02:04
anyway that's the topic moving to new
02:06
homes so
02:07
nowadays it's not unusual for us to
02:09
think of any place can be a new home
02:11
we can move just about anywhere and live
02:13
anywhere
02:14
so that's what we're going to read about
02:16
but first let's take a look at the
02:17
vocabulary
02:19
our first word is new york
02:22
loves ugly that's not our first word
02:25
it's just an interesting t-shirt
02:28
a person whose home is in a certain area
02:32
so new york of course is a
02:35
very famous town they're very famous for
02:37
their spirit
02:38
right uh people who live in new york
02:40
they can call themselves
02:42
citizens of new york okay usually though
02:45
we use citizen for country
02:47
for example people who live in new york
02:49
are citizens of america
02:51
they are american citizens people who
02:53
live in seoul
02:55
are usually korean citizens right
02:58
if you're if your passport has the name
03:01
of the country
03:02
on it right you were a citizen of that
03:04
country if you have a korean passport
03:06
you are a citizen of korea if you are
03:09
have an american passport
03:10
you are a citizen of america and the
03:13
same for every country
03:14
in the world so which country are you a
03:17
citizen
03:18
of okay next one
03:21
do you know this place machu picchu
03:23
right
03:24
this is an event that a person goes
03:26
through if you go visit a world famous
03:29
place like this
03:30
uh what do you say it's an
03:34
up an experience an experience
03:38
so if you go and see machu picchu in
03:40
peru or you go see the
03:42
pyramids in egypt or you go see the
03:44
eiffel tower
03:45
in paris france that is an experience
03:48
that you will remember experience
03:53
experience experience
03:56
experience okay so
03:59
probably you have good experiences of
04:01
traveling maybe your family has taken
04:03
vacations
04:04
to different places right you have good
04:06
experiences
04:07
of your traveling next one to fit in
04:11
naturally to fit in naturally means to
04:13
belong
04:14
of course these apples do they belong
04:17
together you might say well the red one
04:18
doesn't belong
04:20
but maybe it does it depends on how you
04:22
look at it
04:23
they're all apples right so it belongs
04:26
together
04:26
because they're all apples but maybe
04:28
other people say it doesn't belong
04:30
because
04:31
it's red and the others are green but to
04:33
fit in naturally means to belong
04:35
somewhere it belongs with the others
04:37
of course if you go to the supermarket
04:39
apples are in one section sure you have
04:41
green apples red apples
04:43
yellow apples in different places but
04:45
they're all together kind of in the same
04:47
area they belong in the same area
04:51
this is a interesting idea do you know
04:54
this
04:55
for a type of living thing to change
04:58
slowly over time so
05:01
we think about this when you think about
05:03
the
05:05
the age of the earth how old is the
05:08
earth
05:08
right 4.5 billion
05:11
years old we can't even imagine that
05:14
time
05:15
how long has life been on earth since
05:18
at least 3.5 billion years right now
05:21
over that long time life has changed
05:25
into many different
05:26
forms what do we call that process this
05:28
is usually the the picture that they
05:29
usually show
05:30
how accurate it is you know maybe we
05:33
don't know
05:34
but it shows that monkey-like
05:37
creatures changing slowly into human
05:40
beings
05:41
we say evolve now of course
05:45
monkeys did not evolve into human beings
05:48
monkeys are cousins to human beings this
05:51
creature
05:52
doesn't live anymore it's extinct it's
05:54
gone
05:55
but all living creatures have evolved
05:58
over time
05:59
into different forms and shapes if you
06:01
look at horses
06:02
uh go back and look at the evolutionary
06:04
history of horses or
06:06
very interesting look at whales it's
06:08
very interesting how whales
06:09
their ancestors came on land and then
06:12
went back to the sea
06:13
they evolved they changed over time so
06:16
it's a very interesting
06:18
um uh idea about the world
06:21
and it was first evolution was first
06:23
proposed by
06:24
darwin charles darwin in 1860 something
06:28
i can't remember the exact date
06:30
but of course his his idea was very
06:32
controversial but nowadays most
06:34
scientists more than 90 percent of
06:36
scientists
06:40
say that this is fact it's not a theory
06:41
anymore it it actually happened and when
06:43
you think about it it makes sense
06:45
okay so evolve okay so next one to
06:48
create copies of oneself
06:50
so when a when adults
06:54
animals have babies what are they doing
06:56
they are
06:57
reproducing so mama mama sheep will have
07:01
a baby sheep right a lamb okay so
07:04
reproduce
07:05
reproduce reproduce reproduce means to
07:09
make copies
07:10
of oneself okay so when
07:14
animals grow up they become older they
07:15
become adults then they can reproduce
07:17
and have babies of their own next one
07:21
to increase okay so something is
07:23
increasing
07:24
what does it mean it means rise so we
07:27
can see a rise
07:28
usually we use this for charts when
07:30
we're you know you see business people
07:32
using uh this type of graph for to show
07:35
an increase in sales perhaps
07:37
so they say there's been a rise in sales
07:39
okay
07:40
a rise to increase rise is a verb by the
07:43
way
07:44
but also a noun because i said there has
07:47
been arise but you could also say
07:49
sales have risen okay
07:52
rise rose risen because as a verb
07:56
rise rises irregular we say rise
08:00
rose risen okay but sometimes
08:04
rise can also be a noun okay next one
08:07
wow this is a very probably european
08:10
city
08:11
very colorful very interesting place but
08:13
if you look at it you also get the
08:15
impression
08:16
there's so many people there wow it's
08:18
really a lot of
08:19
people so to fill with animals or people
08:22
is to populate populate
08:26
populate so you know a long time ago
08:29
there weren't that many people but
08:31
people you know
08:32
increased the numbers of people
08:33
increased and increased the numbers of
08:35
people
08:36
rose and the earth was populated with
08:39
human beings
08:40
okay and of course all sorts of other
08:42
types of animals
08:44
next one a group of people sharing
08:47
certain traits and beliefs
08:49
if we look at the american indian here
08:51
we know that american indians
08:52
share certain beliefs and behaviors they
08:55
do the same things and they believe
08:57
many different things of course
08:58
different tribes have different beliefs
09:00
i'm not saying all american indians are
09:02
the same that's not true
09:03
but a certain group certain tribes like
09:05
the apache or the cherokee
09:07
or the mohican right they would have in
09:10
their tribes they would have the same
09:12
beliefs of the same traditions
09:14
and of course the same is true with
09:15
countries korean culture
09:17
well i gave just gave you the exam the
09:19
answer culture
09:20
it's a group of people who share the
09:22
same beliefs
09:24
and behaviors actually culture
09:27
when you think about it culture isn't
09:29
really you don't say culture as people
09:31
say culture is the beliefs or behaviors
09:34
of a certain group of people right it's
09:37
what they do
09:38
so korean culture is different from
09:40
american culture
09:41
which is different from french culture
09:43
okay
09:44
so different areas different groups of
09:46
people have
09:47
different culture or different cultures
09:51
okay next one number nine standing
09:53
straight
09:54
not upside down so if you're standing
09:56
straight up right
09:57
you are upright up right
10:00
now this is important of course when
10:02
you're shipping something if you're
10:04
sending something in the mail
10:05
you write on one side of the package or
10:08
this side up
10:08
right you want it to be upright you
10:10
don't want it to be upside down
10:12
because that could be that could
10:13
possibly damage what you have in the
10:15
container
10:16
also it's more natural for us to be
10:18
upright right when we're walking around
10:20
we don't walk around on our hands upside
10:22
down that
10:23
makes our head hurt okay next one ten
10:26
a group of people living and working
10:28
together so a group of people
10:31
living and working together what do we
10:33
call them
10:34
we call that society and we don't
10:37
society is a singular
10:39
noun okay society so not it not them but
10:42
it what do we call a group of people
10:44
living and work together what do we call
10:46
it we call it society and societies have
10:50
different sizes
10:51
right a society can be as small as your
10:53
family but
10:54
usually we talk about society in terms
10:57
of like
10:58
as big as a city or as big as a nation
11:01
or
11:01
sometimes a global society so the entire
11:05
human population in the world we can
11:07
also think of it
11:08
as a society it depends on what our
11:10
purpose is what is our intention
11:12
do we just want to focus on a small
11:13
group or are we talking about
11:15
issues that affect a very big group so
11:18
society when we think about it can be
11:19
small
11:20
or big but usually we think about it as
11:22
the society in which we live
11:24
right what is the uh you know the
11:28
the behavior or the beliefs or the
11:30
customs
11:31
the culture of the people that we're
11:33
living in with what is the size of
11:35
society
11:36
and of course what are the laws of
11:37
society that's something we have to uh
11:39
think about it
11:40
as well the laws uh what do we have to
11:42
do to obey the laws
11:43
what are the expectations of society
11:46
what are we expected to do in society
11:48
so society is basically the group of
11:50
people
11:51
in which we live okay 11.
11:54
well what's wrong with these people they
11:56
look very strange
11:58
they have really long legs the the idea
12:00
here is for most of the time
12:02
for most of the time we say generally
12:05
generally so if we talk about basketball
12:07
players we can make
12:09
general statements most of the time
12:11
basketball players are very tall
12:13
they have very long legs that look like
12:15
golf clubs i'm sorry
12:18
no they don't but usually basketball
12:20
players are very tall
12:21
generally not all sometimes you can find
12:24
short basketball players who are very
12:26
good
12:26
at passing the ball or getting the ball
12:28
down the court but
12:30
generally usually
12:33
for most of the time basketball players
12:35
are very tall and we can make general
12:36
statements about different groups of
12:38
people
12:38
but again be careful about making
12:40
general statements
12:41
because you can always find exceptions
12:44
right it's not always the same
12:46
okay next one a long period of almost no
12:50
food
12:51
so these people are looking for food and
12:53
they
12:54
endure a long period when there no food
12:57
has been grown maybe it's too hot
12:59
there's no
13:00
water so they can't grow food we call
13:02
that
13:03
time a famine famine is a period of time
13:07
that no food is available a long time
13:10
ago of course
13:11
when people couldn't grow crops or there
13:13
were no animals
13:15
to hunt right it was too hot there was
13:17
no water no food so we call that period
13:19
of famine nowadays of course
13:21
famines can be caused by the supply
13:24
chain breaking down right
13:26
people getting food to a certain place
13:28
and that could also cause a famine
13:30
next one wanting to know more so this
13:33
little boy is very curious
13:34
most children are very curious generally
13:37
children are very curious
13:38
about the world around them they are
13:40
curious they want to know more about the
13:44
world
13:45
okay next one to run away from run
13:48
right there's a bull i don't know if you
13:50
can see you can't see the head but this
13:52
is a bull with big horns
13:53
and these guys i think they're in spain
13:55
perhaps pamplona
13:57
where they have every year they run away
13:59
from the bowl which is crazy you know a
14:00
bunch of people will get ready they'll
14:02
release a bull
14:03
and these guys will run down the street
14:05
running away from a bull
14:07
why okay well different people have
14:10
different
14:11
hobbies i guess okay so to run away from
14:13
means to
14:14
flee to flee to run away now flea is an
14:18
irregular verb so we say flee
14:20
fled fled flea fled fled
14:23
these men fled from the bowl okay they
14:25
are fleeing
14:26
from the bowl okay next one to come
14:30
from a source now to come from a source
14:33
it means descend to descend and we're
14:35
talking about evolution here it's a
14:37
strange picture
14:38
but i think what they're getting at is
14:39
that on a chain right there's a watch
14:41
that descends from the chain
14:43
but to come from a source we can also
14:47
think think about the word
14:48
evolution remember the picture evolution
14:50
we saw the monkey type creature
14:52
and then we saw a human being so
14:55
usually when we especially talk about
14:57
evolution we say that
14:59
the modern creatures the modern animals
15:01
have descended
15:03
from a previous animal usually
15:06
not always but generally these animals
15:09
are extinct they don't longer live that
15:11
we can't see them
15:12
nowadays sometimes they they still exist
15:15
in certain cases
15:16
but usually our ancestors are extinct
15:19
right there are no more uh early humans
15:23
that are alive people have to go and dig
15:25
up their bones right
15:27
for the ancestors of human beings but we
15:30
descend
15:30
from some source from a source every
15:33
living thing has descended from
15:35
one source okay next one
15:39
in a single group so in a single group
15:41
we can say together
15:43
so if the dog and the cat are in a
15:45
single group they look like they're
15:46
friends that's very interesting picture
15:48
uh they're together right they're
15:50
together they're pals they're buddies
15:52
they're together in a group okay so
15:54
you're together with your friends
15:55
probably when you go out to play you're
15:57
together in a group
15:59
okay let's go over the words and see how
16:02
well you remember the vocabulary
16:04
number one hang gliding remember hang
16:07
gliding from a previous lesson right
16:09
that's where you're flying
16:10
soaring through the air onto bar with a
16:12
wing above you
16:13
hang gliding is a great what a citizen
16:16
b bridge c experience d culture
16:21
which word fits well is hank glenning a
16:23
great citizen it's a citizen of a
16:25
country
16:26
that doesn't make sense is it a great
16:29
bridge
16:30
that doesn't make sense either is it a
16:31
great experience
16:33
remember an experience is something that
16:35
you remember it's a memorable
16:37
happening in your life something an
16:38
event or something that happens in your
16:40
life
16:41
that's a great experience so hang
16:43
gliding is a great experience
16:44
isn't it because wow that'd be great i
16:47
haven't done it yet i would like to
16:48
someday
16:49
but it would be a great experience and d
16:52
of course hang gliding is not a great
16:54
culture that doesn't make sense
16:55
hang gliding something you do an event
16:57
that you remember
16:58
it's a great experience or it's an
17:00
experience
17:02
number three modern birds beep from
17:05
dinosaurs
17:06
okay there's actually two words from the
17:08
vocabulary list that we could use here
17:10
but only one of those is here thank
17:12
goodness because if both of them were
17:14
here
17:14
we would have to choose both but there's
17:16
only one so a
17:18
populated b evolved c reproduced
17:21
and d created let me tell you the word
17:24
that
17:24
could fit here but not on the answer
17:27
list and that of course
17:28
is descend we could use descended
17:33
descended modern birds descended from
17:36
dinosaurs
17:36
that would fit but it's not one of our
17:38
choices but remember when i was
17:40
describing or
17:41
explaining the meaning of this word
17:44
descend we just did this right a couple
17:46
slides ago or i think was the last word
17:48
descend
17:50
i said i gave you the example of right
17:53
all living three all living things
17:55
descended from
17:56
a previous animal and we saw that
17:59
diagram
18:00
we saw that idea with which word of
18:02
course it was with evolved
18:04
evolve so we could use either word
18:08
modern birds evolved from dinosaurs or
18:11
modern birds
18:12
descended from dinosaurs it means the
18:15
same thing
18:16
not populated not reproduced not created
18:19
those don't fit we're talking about you
18:22
know a previous life
18:23
form or a previous type of animal that
18:26
gives
18:27
birth that reproduces but over a long
18:29
time and
18:30
changes into another type of animal
18:33
and that's evolution that's also
18:35
descending from
18:37
another species or another type of
18:39
animal
18:40
so modern bird modern birds evolve from
18:43
dinosaurs and by the way that's a very
18:44
interesting
18:45
idea if you think oh dinosaurs are no
18:48
longer in the world they're all extinct
18:50
not true birds are a type of dinosaur
18:53
and we can see them every day very
18:55
interesting okay
18:57
five school is strange i don't feel like
19:01
i
19:01
what i don't feel like i if you think
19:03
school is strange
19:05
you don't what i don't feel like i what
19:09
i don't feel like i a belong b make c
19:12
empty d slip so if you think some place
19:15
is strange or a group of people is
19:17
strange
19:17
you don't fit in right you don't
19:21
belong i don't feel like i belong
19:24
maybe you do belong but you don't feel
19:26
like i belong that's too bad
19:28
you have to make some friends if you
19:30
make friends you get used to the people
19:32
there
19:32
you find out oh they're good people then
19:34
you feel like you belong in a place
19:36
right
19:37
but if you feel strange about the people
19:40
you're with
19:40
you don't feel like you have anything in
19:42
common it's hard to talk to them
19:44
then you feel like you don't belong okay
19:46
not make not empty not slip those don't
19:48
make sense
19:49
the best one is belong seven
19:52
south america has a really interesting
19:55
what immigration
19:56
bee culture sea famine or d hat well
20:00
famine is not interesting it's terrible
20:02
it's horrible
20:03
so that doesn't work right it has has a
20:05
really interesting hat
20:06
just one south america has an
20:09
interesting hat it's a really big hat
20:10
that it puts on the whole continent
20:12
now that's crazy right has an
20:14
interesting immigration
20:16
we don't think of immigration as being
20:18
interesting we think of immigration as
20:20
being a pain in the butt
20:21
right it's very difficult right so the
20:24
only one
20:25
south america has a really interesting
20:27
culture that would fit
20:29
because the beliefs and the customs in
20:31
south america
20:32
are very interesting but by the way
20:34
south america has many different
20:36
countries in south america
20:37
and of course there are different
20:38
cultures in each of those different
20:40
countries
20:40
and maybe even inside those countries
20:43
there might be different cultures inside
20:45
the country
20:45
so south america has really interesting
20:48
cultures
20:49
would be more accurate right but you
20:52
could if you're talking about
20:53
although the culture of the the same
20:55
beliefs and
20:56
behaviors that all people from south
20:58
america seem to
21:00
generally a show then that could be
21:02
possible too but it'd be more accurate
21:04
to say there are many different cultures
21:06
in south america and those cultures are
21:08
interesting
21:09
okay that wraps up the vocabulary
21:11
section of
21:12
this lesson let's take a short break
21:14
we'll come back and look at the reading
21:34
[Music]
21:35
you
