hello and welcome back to reading for
vocabulary i'm brian stewart
in this lesson lesson 13 we're going to
talk about computer movies we'll
focus on thinking about movies and
books you know also what kinds of
characters
are in them so we're going to talk about
characters in movies but we're really
going to talk about
special types of characters what types
of characters
well we'll find out later when we do the
reading but first
let's talk about this type of uh
movie characters that we have here now
this is kind of interesting did you see
this movie
avatar did you ever wonder how did they
make the characters in the movie
well this picture kind of tells you this
is the real
actor who played this character
in the movie avatar i'm sorry i forgot
her name
but in the movie but of course there's
no creature that looks like this right
this is her again
and this is what she looks like in real
life this is what she looks like
in the movie look at the difference
isn't that amazing
how can they do that well they use
computer graphics and that's what we're
going to learn about
in this lesson also you may have seen
this movie do you remember this movie
this character here my precious
right okay this character of course is
gollum
from the lord of the rings is there a
really a person like that
no of course not there is not a person
like that
the actor who played gollum actually got
an
award for playing gollum but nobody ever
saw what he really
looked like he was wearing a suit right
with all these
lights on it and when they put his
image in the computer they can make his
image look like
this and who's that of course that's
yoda ayoda i am right i'm sorry i'm not
a very good i can't imitate yoda very
well
but this is yoda from star wars ex was
kind of silly seeing him jump around
you know with the lightsaber but that
was yoda
again there's no real creature like yoda
there's not
real again it was computer graphics
so when we talk about these characters
in the movies
we're going to be talking about how they
can make these types of characters
especially using computer graphics okay
well let's take a look at one more
picture from the movies
and this movie also kind of illustrates
how
movie directors can make scenes
especially in the background of course
this person here is real and probably
the mask he's wearing on his face is
real
but this scene in the background that's
not real right
that's a computer graphic it's probably
a blue screen
right and what these people these actors
act in front of a colored
screen and then on the computer after
they make the film
they can add all sorts of interesting
images
in the background to that blue screen
that the actors are actually acting in
front of
okay well let's begin of course with our
first word on our word list
for the vocabulary now this is an
interesting picture
this character here of course there's no
such thing as a skeleton that can move
and
and hold a lamp so that's not real and
if you saw something like that
you would be really scared wouldn't you
extreme fear what is extreme fear
and this is a word used to describe
certain types of movies that make you
really scared we call those
horror movies a horror movie
is a movie that makes you feel
extreme fear it's horror it's not just
fear
but horror horror is like
okay very very very afraid
or really afraid horror is a strong
degree of fear extreme fear
and if you ever saw an actual skeleton
that's moving
you would probably be horrified you
would be
you would feel horror okay next one
kind of cute what is that can you see
the little boy here
you see his hand and you see his eyes
there
this is a very simple uh example of the
word
this is a very simple a costume is
something you wear
to look special what are they why would
the the kid here wear a costume like
this by the way this is just a bed sheet
a bed sheet it's a sheet
of cloth you put on your bed mom took it
maybe it's an old bed sheet
and she cut two holes in it for the eyes
that's a very
simple costume it's got a very cheap
costume too
but it's a costume costume now
why would a boy or girl wear a costume
to look
special especially this type of costume
what's the event
well in america of course you may have
heard of halloween
halloween is a special day of the year
when kids wear costumes as monsters
as ghosts or as a popular
movie characters or even singers i heard
that recently like last year or the year
before that
many american kids dressed up as psy
right the korean singer
for halloween and they go
trick-or-treating they knock on people's
doors
and they say trick or treat and people
will give them candy
especially they're dressed up in
different costumes so you know
any costume it can be like a monster it
can be
a ghost or it can be famous people too
all sorts of different costumes out
there next one
not real something that is not real this
man is looking at the money
and trying to think is this real or
is it phony is it phony
a phony twenty dollar bill or actually
that looks
it could be a euro i'm not sure what
currency that is
but if the money is not real if it's
phony
it's worthless right unfortunately there
are bad people
who make uh fake copies of money
and try to use it as real money and it's
phony money
there's another word that's very common
we use for that
we say fake if something is fake
it's the same as saying phony not real
it's fake it's not real it's phony
it's not real ph is is pronounced as
phony okay so it's phony
not real or it's fake okay next one
okay now here we have a picture here
when i first saw this picture i'm like
wow is that real it looks so perfect
doesn't it
it's a perfect town and i looked at the
boats and i'm like
what about this boat is that boat real
but yes it is real looking like
something real is
realistic it is realistic and of course
it is real
because there are boats like that and
you can see the detail in the water
everything here is uh looking very
realistic it is very realistic we
believe that this is an
actual picture and it probably is
realistic
means looking like something real
next one oh what's wrong with him
he's feeling fear what can we say about
him
is he frightened he is frightened we
wouldn't say he is frightening
no we wouldn't say that we would say
he's frightened
because that's his reaction to something
that
is frightening be careful right
we may have talked about this before
frightening
use ing for the thing that
causes someone to react
by being frightened frightening
frightened we can also say he is
scared he is scared
or he is afraid right
these are all synonyms for frightened
he's frightened he's afraid he's scared
he saw something that is frightening
okay so frightened means that he is
feeling
fear next one now you know this painting
right this is a
very famous painting uh painted by a
very famous
artist who lived in italy a long time
ago do you know
the name of this painting it's called
the mona lisa
right and why is it such a famous
painting because it looks like a real
person or thing
even though this is just a painting it
was painted a long time ago
and it was painted with such skill
that this woman it looks life like it
looks
life like i just used that word yeah
lifelike it looks
lifelike looks like a real person or
thing
of course the woman who modeled for this
painting
she was real but it's amazing that the
artist's
skill the talent that the artist
leonardo da vinci
could paint such a life-like
picture of the actual woman okay
okay next one to tell the difference
here we have a picture of many people
raising their
signs they're saying yes they're
agreeing but there's one person in the
middle says
no and they're different from the other
people
that person we can distinguish that
person because we can
easily see the difference when you
distinguish
distinguish distinguish
when you distinguish something that
means you can see
the difference for example can you
distinguish
who is the boss and who are the
employees can you tell can you see the
difference
can you tell the difference between the
boss and the employees
sometimes you can't you have to watch
and see how people
act then you can distinguish who the
who's the boss and who are the employees
but sometimes if you just look very
quickly you can't other things are very
easy to distinguish it's very easy to
distinguish
if you see several people and one person
is blonde
and the other people have brown hair
then you can easily distinguish the
blonde
person right away you can tell the
difference distinguish
okay this person has an idea it's
represented with this drawing
we usually use this idea light bulb a
light
bulb is going turning on
in her head a light bulb is turning on
in her head
that's a common idea having new ideas
and making new things
if somebody can do this many times
during the day
we call them creative because they have
many new ideas
having new ideas or making new things
if you think of new ideas if you can
think of
new ways to draw or new ways to make
something
then perhaps you are creative too also
authors are creative they come up with
different stories like jk
rawlings who wrote the harry potter
series
she's very creative to think of all
those characters
and all those new ideas for a story
right
so there are many creative people in the
world they think of new things
and they make new things okay number
nine
this is very a beautiful landscape the
appearance
of a place so we're looking at the
principle like don't worry about the
woman
but we're looking about the appearance
you know very interesting
distinguishing mountains right but if we
look at some place
and we say wow the beep is very
beautiful
we say the scenery is very beautiful
it's the appearance
of a place what a place looks like if
you go up into the mountains
it's very beautiful scenery you go to
the beach you look out over the ocean
and the beach the sand
that's beautiful scenery sometimes
scenery isn't so beautiful
if you go to a train station scenery is
not so good
or if you go to a town that there are
many factories
the scenery is not so good so scenery
doesn't mean good or bad
it's just what things look like what is
the scenery
where you live okay
speed limit is 25 miles per hour
in korea you would say kilometers per
hour
but it's the greatest amount of possible
and i said the word is actually right
here
it's limit right the word we're looking
for is limit
so limit means the greatest amount
possible
that means the greatest amount you can
drive
the speed that you can drive in this
area is 25
whether it's miles per hour or
kilometers per hour
depends what country you're in right but
it's the limit
you can't go over that you cannot go
over that
if you do you'll get arrested right it's
the greatest amount possible
in this case under the law but it's the
greatest amount possible
in a certain place it's the limit
okay she's having a good a good time
right she looks like she's having a
party
causing great interest that of course
is exciting and look cause
the cause we use ing
the cause it's exciting her reaction
would be x i what x
i ted you got it good her reaction would
be excited
the cause is exciting something that
causes great interest
is exciting her reaction is excited
okay now this man what is he doing
he looks like he's about to go swimming
right
he is standing on the end part of
something
the end part of the deck right that's
the end
what do we call that we call that the
edge
he's standing on the edge of the pool
deck right be careful don't stand
on the edge of a cliff right if you go
to see the grand canyon or if you go up
in the mountains and you have a good
view
don't stand on the edge that's dangerous
don't stand on the end part
stay away from the edge okay but the
edge
is the end there's no more land you fall
off
okay in this case it's okay he's going
to fall in the water and go swimming
but be careful of other edges like on
the edge of a cliff
or at the mountains okay oh you know him
that's johnny depp right he was the main
character
in the pirates of the caribbean movies
a person who acts and plays our movies
what is johnny depp
johnny depp is an actor okay
there are many famous actors that you
can probably name right away
like johnny depp brad pitt george
clooney
these are famous actors sometimes
however
people will use actor for women too
oh it actor is a person doesn't mean a
man
used to be actor was only man but now we
use that also to describe
women before they said actress but it's
becoming more and more common now
people just say actor for men and women
okay do you know this picture this is a
famous picture
what is it a picture of it's a picture
of the
loch huchness that's a scottish accent
it's in scotland in scotland they say
loves
okay but loch lochness what the loch
ness
monster it's the loch ness monster but
it's not
real this is a fake or phony picture
it's a
phony picture it was a trick
somebody tried to uh play a trick on
many people
and said there was a monster in the lake
a horrible creature
a terrible creature and they said it's
the loch ness monster
but it's not real but a monster is a
horrible creature a terrible creature
that would be a monster 15
to get very cold i feel cold just
looking at this picture
right what happened to the water around
this boat
this boat is not supposed to be on snow
and ice
right this boat is supposed to be in
water it was in water
but the water got very cold what did the
water do
it freeze freeze to freeze
it froze freeze froze frozen
so the water around the boat froze
right when water freezes it turns into
ice okay so to get very cold
is to freeze it's freeze is also when a
liquid turns into a solid
like water turning into ice okay
so that is freeze next
not easy to do it's not easy to climb a
mountain is it it's very difficult
it takes a lot of effort it's especially
difficult
when the mountain is covered in snow and
it's very cold out
so not easy to do something is difficult
oh hinduro
it's difficult it's hard to do
do not say i am
hard to
climb the mountain whoops
climb that's m climb the mountain don't
say that
this is konglish many students say this
i am hard no not i it
it is don't say i am hard say it is hard
it's hard to climb the mountain or it's
difficult to climb the mountain okay
but please stop saying this if you're
saying this i am hard
i am difficult no it it is difficult to
climb the mountain
it is difficult to walk up the stairs
okay it the situation not you
okay uh it is hard to climb the mountain
it is difficult to climb the mountain
okay so something's difficult it is hard
to do it let's go over the exercises
here
in the exercises we should complete each
sentence with a word
from the box these are the sentences
these
are our words let's review the words
before we begin
first we have horror horror
next costume costume
next is phony phony
next we have realistic realistic
next is frightened frightened
next is life like life like
and distinguish distinguish
finally we have creative
creative okay those are the words in the
box
let's see where they go in the sentences
number one
the bad boys are not right don't you say
nothing
you just say naladi right he said naladi
right bad boys
okay the bad boys made beep
phone calls to the fire station all
those bad boys
they were making phone calls to the fire
station
that were not real they weren't true
that's terrible don't do that okay
the bad boys made what's not real what
word means
not real or fake
phony the bad boys made phony phone
calls to the fire station
this is really bad don't ever do that
don't ever make a phony phone call to
the fire station
or the police it could be very dangerous
it's very bad to do
the normal nomunapun
boys i think you say naladi right very
bad boys
very bad boys they shouldn't do that
number two
an expert can beep real
pearls from imitations so an expert
this is kind of similar to phony right
think about
real pearls from imitations imitations
would be phony pearls
now what is a pearl a pearl
is a precious uh it's like a stone
you find it in an oyster or a clam it's
a round
white and sometimes very beautiful if
you get a good pearl
very beautiful i like stone and people
will use it in
jewelry especially necklaces now of
course an
expert can tell because some people try
to copy
the real pearl from nature right but an
expert
can tell the difference what's another
word for tell the difference
another word that we talked about here
is distinguish
distinguish so an expert can distinguish
real pearls from limitations it means an
expert can
tell the difference between a real pearl
and a phony pearl an imitation a
fake pearl okay and of course you have
to be careful there's people out there
who try to cheat
they'll make phony money they'll make
phony pearls
they'll make phony uh gems uh diamonds
and things like that
but how do you know usually experts can
look at them
and they know because they're experts
they know a lot about their subject
okay next one number three i don't
believe that you can fly
i don't believe that you can fly who can
fly i don't believe anybody can fly
please be more what so in this situation
one person is telling this person that
oh hey i can fly you can fly
i don't believe you can fly please be
more what
please be more realistic
don't be silly don't you know make up
things
don't uh make phony beliefs or phony
statements
be realistic in other words something
that
is real or true to life okay
four this fake flower is really what
it's interesting a lot of these
sentences are using
fake phony imitation a lot of the
subjects a lot of these words
have to do with that idea so this fake
flower not a real flower but a fake
flower
is really what is really
life like it's fake but it looks
lifelike it looks like it's real
it's life like okay
next one five the old woman likes to
wear a traditional
beep all the time now here we have
traditional
and here we have where what can you wear
here
the only thing you can wear is a costume
but here we have traditional
now the example i used for costume and
we saw was uh of the little boy in a bed
sheet he looked like a ghost
right and of course it's costume
but in this case it's a traditional
costume
costume isn't always you know about
for halloween people don't just wear
costumes on halloween
when they want to look like a ghost or a
monster or famous person
sometimes costume also means the
traditional clothes
of a people or a culture right if you
think about it
what is the traditional costume for
koreans
hanbok right it's what koreans would
have worn a long time ago 100 years ago
you could also say that is a costume in
germany they would wear
lederhosen right it's a traditional
german dress
for germany every country has different
traditional costumes
there's special clothes that people wear
for special occasions
okay so they can be costumes also
number six she was beep to see a
stranger
in the dark alley she was what if you
see a stranger
somebody you don't know in a dark alley
it's
dark this could be surprising you could
be a little musa while you could be a
little what
you could be a little frightened she was
frightened
to see a stranger in the dark
alley she was frightened by the way it's
funny just a little story about korean
uh i remember muso
musawa musa because you know the big suv
the muso i think oh muso so i am afraid
okay so long hey i'm sorry but that's
just funny is sometimes you use these
little tricks
to remember words okay so you know the
car called musso
it comes i'm afraid
i'm sorry okay next one okay number
seven
a good writer has a great beep talent
a good writer what do writers do writers
have to think
of new ideas they have to make
new stories right so somebody who can
make
new ideas or think of new ideas and make
new things we call those people creative
a writer good writer has a great
creative
talent a creative talent they can make
or think of new things
eight i was filled with beep at the
sight
of the dead body uh if you saw
a dead body how would you feel now
you would feel frightened but you're not
filled with frightened
you're filled with horror i was filled
with
horror at the sight of the dead body so
maybe you're frightened
by a dead body but you are
filled with some with horror
at the site so that's kind of a special
construction for using horror you were
filled with horror
at the sight of something that's a
common uh collocation it's a common
expression
common usage okay so those are our words
some good words and some good sentences
to learn those
again like i said we can see a lot of
them are about you know
distinguishing between something that's
phony and something that's real a lot of
these
and of course that's what the reading
passage will be about and we're going to
go over that in just a second so don't
go away
you

00:16
talk about computer movies we'll
00:19
focus on thinking about movies and
00:22
books you know also what kinds of
00:26
characters
00:26
are in them so we're going to talk about
00:30
characters in movies but we're really
00:32
going to talk about
00:34
special types of characters what types
00:36
of characters
00:37
well we'll find out later when we do the
00:39
reading but first
00:41
let's talk about this type of uh
00:44
movie characters that we have here now
00:47
this is kind of interesting did you see
00:49
this movie
00:50
avatar did you ever wonder how did they
00:53
make the characters in the movie
00:55
well this picture kind of tells you this
00:57
is the real
00:58
actor who played this character
01:02
in the movie avatar i'm sorry i forgot
01:04
her name
01:05
but in the movie but of course there's
01:07
no creature that looks like this right
01:09
this is her again
01:11
and this is what she looks like in real
01:12
life this is what she looks like
01:15
in the movie look at the difference
01:17
isn't that amazing
01:18
how can they do that well they use
01:20
computer graphics and that's what we're
01:22
going to learn about
01:23
in this lesson also you may have seen
01:26
this movie do you remember this movie
01:28
this character here my precious
01:32
right okay this character of course is
01:34
gollum
01:35
from the lord of the rings is there a
01:37
really a person like that
01:39
no of course not there is not a person
01:42
like that
01:43
the actor who played gollum actually got
01:46
an
01:46
award for playing gollum but nobody ever
01:49
saw what he really
01:51
looked like he was wearing a suit right
01:54
with all these
01:55
lights on it and when they put his
01:58
image in the computer they can make his
02:00
image look like
02:01
this and who's that of course that's
02:05
yoda ayoda i am right i'm sorry i'm not
02:07
a very good i can't imitate yoda very
02:09
well
02:10
but this is yoda from star wars ex was
02:13
kind of silly seeing him jump around
02:15
you know with the lightsaber but that
02:18
was yoda
02:18
again there's no real creature like yoda
02:21
there's not
02:22
real again it was computer graphics
02:25
so when we talk about these characters
02:28
in the movies
02:29
we're going to be talking about how they
02:31
can make these types of characters
02:33
especially using computer graphics okay
02:36
well let's take a look at one more
02:38
picture from the movies
02:39
and this movie also kind of illustrates
02:42
how
02:43
movie directors can make scenes
02:46
especially in the background of course
02:48
this person here is real and probably
02:50
the mask he's wearing on his face is
02:52
real
02:52
but this scene in the background that's
02:55
not real right
02:56
that's a computer graphic it's probably
02:58
a blue screen
03:00
right and what these people these actors
03:02
act in front of a colored
03:04
screen and then on the computer after
03:07
they make the film
03:08
they can add all sorts of interesting
03:10
images
03:11
in the background to that blue screen
03:15
that the actors are actually acting in
03:17
front of
03:18
okay well let's begin of course with our
03:21
first word on our word list
03:23
for the vocabulary now this is an
03:25
interesting picture
03:27
this character here of course there's no
03:30
such thing as a skeleton that can move
03:32
and
03:32
and hold a lamp so that's not real and
03:35
if you saw something like that
03:37
you would be really scared wouldn't you
03:40
extreme fear what is extreme fear
03:43
and this is a word used to describe
03:46
certain types of movies that make you
03:48
really scared we call those
03:51
horror movies a horror movie
03:55
is a movie that makes you feel
03:58
extreme fear it's horror it's not just
04:01
fear
04:02
but horror horror is like
04:06
okay very very very afraid
04:09
or really afraid horror is a strong
04:12
degree of fear extreme fear
04:15
and if you ever saw an actual skeleton
04:18
that's moving
04:19
you would probably be horrified you
04:22
would be
04:23
you would feel horror okay next one
04:27
kind of cute what is that can you see
04:30
the little boy here
04:31
you see his hand and you see his eyes
04:33
there
04:34
this is a very simple uh example of the
04:38
word
04:38
this is a very simple a costume is
04:42
something you wear
04:43
to look special what are they why would
04:47
the the kid here wear a costume like
04:50
this by the way this is just a bed sheet
04:53
a bed sheet it's a sheet
04:56
of cloth you put on your bed mom took it
04:59
maybe it's an old bed sheet
05:00
and she cut two holes in it for the eyes
05:03
that's a very
05:04
simple costume it's got a very cheap
05:06
costume too
05:07
but it's a costume costume now
05:10
why would a boy or girl wear a costume
05:14
to look
05:15
special especially this type of costume
05:18
what's the event
05:19
well in america of course you may have
05:21
heard of halloween
05:24
halloween is a special day of the year
05:28
when kids wear costumes as monsters
05:31
as ghosts or as a popular
05:35
movie characters or even singers i heard
05:38
that recently like last year or the year
05:40
before that
05:42
many american kids dressed up as psy
05:44
right the korean singer
05:46
for halloween and they go
05:48
trick-or-treating they knock on people's
05:50
doors
05:50
and they say trick or treat and people
05:52
will give them candy
05:53
especially they're dressed up in
05:55
different costumes so you know
05:57
any costume it can be like a monster it
05:59
can be
06:00
a ghost or it can be famous people too
06:03
all sorts of different costumes out
06:05
there next one
06:07
not real something that is not real this
06:10
man is looking at the money
06:12
and trying to think is this real or
06:15
is it phony is it phony
06:18
a phony twenty dollar bill or actually
06:20
that looks
06:21
it could be a euro i'm not sure what
06:23
currency that is
06:24
but if the money is not real if it's
06:27
phony
06:27
it's worthless right unfortunately there
06:30
are bad people
06:31
who make uh fake copies of money
06:35
and try to use it as real money and it's
06:37
phony money
06:38
there's another word that's very common
06:40
we use for that
06:42
we say fake if something is fake
06:45
it's the same as saying phony not real
06:48
it's fake it's not real it's phony
06:52
it's not real ph is is pronounced as
06:55
phony okay so it's phony
06:58
not real or it's fake okay next one
07:02
okay now here we have a picture here
07:04
when i first saw this picture i'm like
07:06
wow is that real it looks so perfect
07:09
doesn't it
07:10
it's a perfect town and i looked at the
07:12
boats and i'm like
07:13
what about this boat is that boat real
07:16
but yes it is real looking like
07:18
something real is
07:19
realistic it is realistic and of course
07:22
it is real
07:23
because there are boats like that and
07:24
you can see the detail in the water
07:27
everything here is uh looking very
07:30
realistic it is very realistic we
07:32
believe that this is an
07:34
actual picture and it probably is
07:36
realistic
07:37
means looking like something real
07:40
next one oh what's wrong with him
07:43
he's feeling fear what can we say about
07:46
him
07:47
is he frightened he is frightened we
07:51
wouldn't say he is frightening
07:53
no we wouldn't say that we would say
07:55
he's frightened
07:57
because that's his reaction to something
07:59
that
08:00
is frightening be careful right
08:03
we may have talked about this before
08:05
frightening
08:07
use ing for the thing that
08:10
causes someone to react
08:14
by being frightened frightening
08:17
frightened we can also say he is
08:21
scared he is scared
08:24
or he is afraid right
08:28
these are all synonyms for frightened
08:31
he's frightened he's afraid he's scared
08:35
he saw something that is frightening
08:38
okay so frightened means that he is
08:42
feeling
08:42
fear next one now you know this painting
08:46
right this is a
08:47
very famous painting uh painted by a
08:50
very famous
08:51
artist who lived in italy a long time
08:54
ago do you know
08:55
the name of this painting it's called
08:58
the mona lisa
08:59
right and why is it such a famous
09:03
painting because it looks like a real
09:06
person or thing
09:07
even though this is just a painting it
09:10
was painted a long time ago
09:11
and it was painted with such skill
09:14
that this woman it looks life like it
09:18
looks
09:18
life like i just used that word yeah
09:21
lifelike it looks
09:22
lifelike looks like a real person or
09:25
thing
09:26
of course the woman who modeled for this
09:29
painting
09:29
she was real but it's amazing that the
09:32
artist's
09:33
skill the talent that the artist
09:35
leonardo da vinci
09:36
could paint such a life-like
09:40
picture of the actual woman okay
09:44
okay next one to tell the difference
09:47
here we have a picture of many people
09:49
raising their
09:50
signs they're saying yes they're
09:52
agreeing but there's one person in the
09:53
middle says
09:54
no and they're different from the other
09:57
people
09:58
that person we can distinguish that
10:01
person because we can
10:02
easily see the difference when you
10:05
distinguish
10:06
distinguish distinguish
10:09
when you distinguish something that
10:12
means you can see
10:14
the difference for example can you
10:16
distinguish
10:17
who is the boss and who are the
10:20
employees can you tell can you see the
10:23
difference
10:24
can you tell the difference between the
10:26
boss and the employees
10:27
sometimes you can't you have to watch
10:30
and see how people
10:31
act then you can distinguish who the
10:34
who's the boss and who are the employees
10:36
but sometimes if you just look very
10:38
quickly you can't other things are very
10:40
easy to distinguish it's very easy to
10:42
distinguish
10:43
if you see several people and one person
10:46
is blonde
10:47
and the other people have brown hair
10:49
then you can easily distinguish the
10:51
blonde
10:52
person right away you can tell the
10:54
difference distinguish
10:56
okay this person has an idea it's
11:00
represented with this drawing
11:01
we usually use this idea light bulb a
11:04
light
11:05
bulb is going turning on
11:08
in her head a light bulb is turning on
11:10
in her head
11:11
that's a common idea having new ideas
11:14
and making new things
11:16
if somebody can do this many times
11:18
during the day
11:20
we call them creative because they have
11:23
many new ideas
11:25
having new ideas or making new things
11:28
if you think of new ideas if you can
11:32
think of
11:32
new ways to draw or new ways to make
11:36
something
11:37
then perhaps you are creative too also
11:40
authors are creative they come up with
11:42
different stories like jk
11:44
rawlings who wrote the harry potter
11:46
series
11:47
she's very creative to think of all
11:50
those characters
11:51
and all those new ideas for a story
11:53
right
11:54
so there are many creative people in the
11:56
world they think of new things
11:58
and they make new things okay number
12:01
nine
12:03
this is very a beautiful landscape the
12:06
appearance
12:07
of a place so we're looking at the
12:09
principle like don't worry about the
12:10
woman
12:11
but we're looking about the appearance
12:13
you know very interesting
12:15
distinguishing mountains right but if we
12:17
look at some place
12:19
and we say wow the beep is very
12:22
beautiful
12:23
we say the scenery is very beautiful
12:25
it's the appearance
12:27
of a place what a place looks like if
12:30
you go up into the mountains
12:32
it's very beautiful scenery you go to
12:34
the beach you look out over the ocean
12:36
and the beach the sand
12:37
that's beautiful scenery sometimes
12:40
scenery isn't so beautiful
12:41
if you go to a train station scenery is
12:45
not so good
12:45
or if you go to a town that there are
12:47
many factories
12:48
the scenery is not so good so scenery
12:51
doesn't mean good or bad
12:52
it's just what things look like what is
12:55
the scenery
12:56
where you live okay
13:00
speed limit is 25 miles per hour
13:03
in korea you would say kilometers per
13:06
hour
13:07
but it's the greatest amount of possible
13:10
and i said the word is actually right
13:11
here
13:12
it's limit right the word we're looking
13:14
for is limit
13:16
so limit means the greatest amount
13:18
possible
13:19
that means the greatest amount you can
13:22
drive
13:22
the speed that you can drive in this
13:25
area is 25
13:27
whether it's miles per hour or
13:29
kilometers per hour
13:30
depends what country you're in right but
13:33
it's the limit
13:34
you can't go over that you cannot go
13:37
over that
13:37
if you do you'll get arrested right it's
13:39
the greatest amount possible
13:41
in this case under the law but it's the
13:44
greatest amount possible
13:45
in a certain place it's the limit
13:49
okay she's having a good a good time
13:52
right she looks like she's having a
13:53
party
13:54
causing great interest that of course
13:57
is exciting and look cause
14:00
the cause we use ing
14:04
the cause it's exciting her reaction
14:07
would be x i what x
14:10
i ted you got it good her reaction would
14:14
be excited
14:15
the cause is exciting something that
14:17
causes great interest
14:19
is exciting her reaction is excited
14:23

14:41
edge
14:42

14:45
deck right be careful don't stand
14:49
on the edge of a cliff right if you go
14:52
to see the grand canyon or if you go up
14:55
in the mountains and you have a good
14:56
view
14:57
don't stand on the edge that's dangerous
14:59
don't stand on the end part

stay away from the edge okay but the
15:04
edge
15:04
is the end there's no more land you fall
15:07
off
15:08
okay in this case it's okay he's going

20:57
number two
20:59
an expert can beep real
21:02
pearls from imitations so an expert
21:06
this is kind of similar to phony right
21:08
think about
21:09
real pearls from imitations imitations
21:12
would be phony pearls
21:16
now what is a pearl a pearl
21:19
is a precious uh it's like a stone
21:22

you get a good pearl
21:30
very beautiful i like stone and people
21:32
will use it in
21:33
jewelry especially necklaces now of
21:36
course an
21:36
expert can tell because some people try
21:39
to copy
21:40
the real pearl from nature right but an
21:43
expert
21:44
can tell the difference what's another
21:48
word for tell the difference
21:49
another word that we talked about here
21:52

real pearls from limitations it means an
22:00
expert can
22:01
tell the difference between a real pearl
22:05
and a phony pearl an imitation a
22:08
fake pearl okay and of course you have
22:11
to be careful there's people out there
22:13

22:14
they'll make phony money they'll make
22:16
phony pearls
22:18
they'll make phony uh gems uh diamonds
22:21
and things like that
22:22
but how do you know usually experts can
22:25
look at them
22:26
and they know because they're experts
22:27
they know a lot about their subject
22:30

22:32
believe that you can fly
22:34

23:10
four this fake flower is really what
23:14

23:15
sentences are using
23:17
fake phony imitation a lot of the
23:20
subjects a lot of these words
23:22
