hello everybody
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
i'm brian stewart
we're on our last lesson for talking
about the human body
when we talked about bones one of the
things we talked about
was how to keep your bones healthy in
lesson 12
we'll talk about how to keep your whole
body healthy
staying healthy very important
subject we will focus on thinking about
how we can keep our bodies healthy
how can we stay healthy that's a very
important topic so let's begin of course
by
looking at some words some vocabulary of
course before we do that though
let's just review or preview some ideas
about how we can keep our bodies strong
you can think about it right we've
talked in the last lessons a little bit
about some ways that we can keep
our bodies strong and there might be
some new ways here
first of all we have a picture here of a
little baby
holding a teddy bear all so cute right
but what is the baby doing
the baby is resting or sleeping
you must sleep to keep your body strong
don't stay up all night playing video
games right
that's not good for you so sleep
get plenty of rest what's this here
well this is good food healthy food of
course we should eat healthy food
to help our bodies stay healthy and
strong
we should also wash our bodies right
if we don't wash our bodies not only do
we
smell right nem sena right
but also we might get sick right we have
to keep our bodies
clean so we don't get sick
and finally we should also exercise
and spend time with friends but these
women here they're
stretching they're exercising they're
running
they're doing yoga they are exercising
their bodies
so these are all ways that we can keep
our bodies
healthy and strong can you think of some
other ways
maybe you can as we go over the
vocabulary together
okay the first word on our word list
is good for your body that's the
definition
good for your body if something is good
for your body what do we say
it is healthy we just saw
several different ways or several
different
things that are good for our body
sleeping
resting is healthy eating good food
is healthy washing our bodies is healthy
exercising is healthy these are all
healthy things to do
so we go hell fee healthy
healthy put them together okay so of
course she's doing something that's very
healthy she's
exercising two
not good this is not good
do not pull your older sister's hair
right
that's not good if you do that you are
bad don't be bad be good
right so don't annoy or
hurt your friends or your sisters or
your brothers
be good not bad three
food that is bad for you ok now this
looks like a hamburger
french fries ketchup this is junk food
right
at a fast food restaurant food that is
bad for you
i just said junk food junk
food it's two words j j
n k unk junk
junk food so it's junk food don't eat
too much
junk food maybe once in a while it's
okay
but don't eat a lot of junk food
number four the part of the body
that helps us move so look at this
person here looks like a man is here
he's exercising
parts of his body are very strong
they're very big
they are muscles these are the parts of
the body that help us
move right bones support us
but bones need muscles in order for us
to move
every time we move we're using a muscle
even if you just move your eyes you're
using the muscles
in your eyes so we have muscles all over
our body
do you have muscles that can move your
ears can you move your ear
am i moving my ear those are also
muscles in your head
that you can move your ears right so
think about it you've got muscles
everywhere five power that we get from
food and sleep so power we need
power to make our muscles move we get
that power
when we sleep when we have no power we
go to sleep
we wake up ah we've got power back and
we also need to
eat to keep that power going what do we
call it
we call it energy n
r g n r g
energy energy not energy
energy energy okay
six to make
these people are making a house or a
building right what do you say when you
make something
you build it right you build something
now be careful with build build is a
verb
it's an irregular verb it changes
form for the past tense build
built built build built
built okay they built a house
have they built the house yet okay
seven to take a break
one of the things we talked about
was to get enough sleep that's healthy
for your body
at night you sleep but sometimes during
the day
right you don't want to sleep for eight
hours right you just want to take a
short sleep you just want to rest
so you lay down close your eyes for five
minutes
10 minutes take a rest take a rest
take a
rest so take a rest take
a rest you look tired why don't you
take a rest take a rest short break
take a break same thing eight
what happened here this is i hope not
okay i hope he didn't die right but uh
he didn't
when you have no energy you feel like
this right you have no energy
you just fall over right what happened
tired
you're very tired you have no energy
then it's time to take a rest but this
person is very tired
they just fell over they want to sleep
right
nine to move quickly using your legs
so what is this boy doing right he's
moving very quickly
he's using his legs run
to run he is running be careful
with run run is an irregular verb
changes in the past so run run
run run run run kind of goes back right
run run run but this is still past tense
right
i have run uh i have run
five miles right i how
how far did you run well i have run five
miles since this morning
and i've got five more to do wow it's a
lot of running right
so run run run a mile is like
a little bit longer than a kilometer
right so i have run
five kilometers this morning i'm gonna
run another five kilometers this
afternoon
okay the next one oh interesting
exciting picture right
what's going on here this is inside your
body
and there's one organ that we're
highlighting the organ in red
that is the part of your body that moves
your blood so you can see all these red
things going along those are where your
blood
is going right but this is the organ
that
pumps blood through those places what is
it of course
you know it's the heart
right makes that sound the heart again
heart rt earth heart
heart okay so it's the heart in your
body that
pumps blood it moves your blood around
and if you listen
to you can't listen to yourself but you
can listen to your brother or sister
you can hear it go right
very interesting next word
boys and girls we have several uh well
i think he's a boy and we have two girls
but it doesn't matter
boy or girl a group it could be all
girls it could be
all boys doesn't matter what do we call
them
together we call them children more than
one
boys and girls together or many boys
or many girls doesn't matter we just say
children next one what is she doing
she's writing something and she's using
her muscles
in her brain right she's using the
muscles in her brain i don't know if you
have muscles
but she's using her brain power she to
use your mind
to think of something she is thinking
to think you think of something you need
to think
in order to do your homework okay but be
careful with think
it's an irregular verb think thought
thought
think thought thought
i i just thought of something right i
thought of something to
yesterday but i forgot it now okay so
think
thought thought what's going on here
is it dead no as you know bears
sleep in the winter time right but
they're not dead
they are continued to be alive they're
not dead
they're alive they are alive but to live
be careful because you can say live but
you can also say
live live if you say
it is a
live band
that is an adjective but if you say
don't die please
live or please live
well please enjoy your life please live
that's a verb so this is adjective
and this is verb it's different
pronunciations
it's a live band that means the band is
there in person the members
the people are actually there it's not a
recording
it's a live band but if you say it as a
verb it's
live so live live
in this case it's live to continue to be
alive this is a verb
that is live okay so different
pronunciations
same spelling different meanings
okay next one hey happy birthday right
okay a sweet baked food okay
this of course is a birthday cake okay
there's many
kinds of cake a birthday cake
anniversary cake kunyang cake
i like kunyang cake don't you okay cake
just because
cake is good okay so cake uh sweet baked
food
that's a cake 15. now this is also a
sweet food
is it a food maybe many children
think that it's a food but it's not a
good food
sweet food made of sugar it's just
made of sugar what do you what is it of
course you probably like it
candy candy of course all kids like
candy right
we like to eat candy and a lot of adults
like to eat candy too
but don't eat too much it's not good for
your teeth
next one well this is a very beautiful
picture to stop from
changing so basically what we're talking
about here is like this is the eiffel
tower in france
the eiffel tower has been there for a
long long time
it keeps from changing it keeps the same
you could also say stay
stay the same stay the same
keep the same keep don't change don't
change
you keep the same so think about it this
eiffel tower
has been in paris france for a long time
the city has changed but the eiffel
tower
has kept the same and
keep kept kept so it's an irregular verb
keep cap paris has changed
but the eiffel tower has kept the same
okay so keep kept kept okay that wraps
up the words
let's do the exercises the first
exercise we're doing here
is word groups so what we have here
are four word groups right two words of
the group
and then we have to choose the word
write the word
from the box that best finishes
each word group so we have two words
here
what's the next word that is part of
that
group what words go together the words
are
first healthy healthy
then rest rest
muscle muscle and
tired tired oh piggle nail okay
okay so the first one exercise apples
carrots
apples carrots what word here best
belongs to these other two words apples
and carrots
are of course healthy so the word here
is healthy apples carrots healthy
okay that would be the best word from
the box to go in here two
bone heart then something think about it
in your body
you have bones you have a heart what
else do you have in your body
what else is in your body of course
muscle
muscles are in your body muscle
three break nap if you take a break
you take a nap what are you doing you're
resting
take a rest take a break take a nap take
a rest okay number four yawn
yawn we didn't go over that but yawn
what is yawn
yawn is when you do this
oh pico nail right if you if i yawn
maybe you yawn too
right it's like a cold it it goes from
one person to another
but i hope you're not sleepy now okay
i'm just showing you the example
that's a yawn when people yawn they're
sleepy
or they are tired so when people are
tired or sleepy
they yawn okay the next one
now this is a little bit different this
is to choose the word circle the words
that are the same
as the word in bold print remember
bold print is darker
wider letters okay this is bold print
so we have to look at the word in bold
print and circle
right circle the words that are the same
so we have the sentence here what word
is the same as energy we need to
circle that so number one she has the
power to work
because she eats well in this sentence
what word is the same as energy
energy well energy is power
isn't it if you chose that word that's
the right answer
she has the energy to work because she
eats well
or she has the power to work
because she eats well we can use either
word
in this case okay they're the same
number two too much salt
is not good for you so we're looking for
a word
or words that mean the same as bad and
we need to circle those
so bad is what that is good
bad is no not good it's the opposite ah
but here's
not so we can circle them together
right and we can say not good is the
same as bad
too much salt is bad for you
so we can substitute see okay
okay two more for the same same idea
here we have junk food so we're looking
for a word
or words a group of words that mean the
same as
junk food the sentence is i
don't eat food that is bad
for my body i don't eat food
that is bad for my body in this sentence
what are the word or words that mean the
same as junk food
well we know junk is not good junk is
bad
so we need to include this bad here but
food of course food is here and
basically
junk food is food that
is bad okay food that is bad
well for your body you could circle that
too but basically food that is bad
is junk food okay
build remember to build to make
something right
i drink milk to make my bones
strong okay so build and make are the
same
right but you could also do this right
you could also circle both of them if
you wanted to i drink milk
to make my bones if you said to make
your bones
yeah but to make your bones strong to
build them well
okay you could use one or the other or
together
make something strong is to build it
okay
but also just to make something also
means to build something
okay so those are our words that wraps
up the end of the vocabulary section
we're going to take a short break come
back and look at the reading together so
don't go away

10:39
they're not dead
10:41
they are continued to be alive they're
10:43
not dead
10:44
they're alive they are alive but to live
10:48
be careful because you can say live but
10:50
you can also say
10:52
live live if you say
10:55
it is a
10:58
live band
11:02
that is an adjective but if you say
11:06
don't die please
11:10
live or please live
11:14
well please enjoy your life please live
11:17
that's a verb so this is adjective
11:21
and this is verb it's different
11:23
pronunciations
11:25
it's a live band that means the band is
11:28
there in person the members
11:31
the people are actually there it's not a
11:33
recording
11:34
it's a live band but if you say it as a
11:37
verb it's
11:38
live so live live
11:42
in this case it's live to continue to be
11:45
alive this is a verb
11:47
that is live okay so different
11:49
pronunciations
11:50
same spelling different meanings
11:54
okay next one hey happy birthday right
11:59

12:02

12:06
kinds of cake a birthday cake
12:08

12:14
just because
12:15
cake is good okay so cake uh sweet baked
12:19
food
12:19
that's a cake 15. now this is also a
12:23
sweet food
12:24
is it a food maybe many children
12:27
think that it's a food but it's not a
12:30
good food
12:31
sweet food made of sugar it's just
12:34
made of sugar what do you what is it of
12:36
course you probably like it
12:38
candy candy of course all kids like
12:42
candy right
12:43
we like to eat candy and a lot of adults
12:46
like to eat candy too
12:48
but don't eat too much it's not good for
12:50
your teeth
12:51
next one well this is a very beautiful
12:54
picture to stop from
12:55
changing so basically what we're talking
12:58
about here is like this is the eiffel
13:00
tower in france
13:01
the eiffel tower has been there for a
13:03
long long time
13:05
it keeps from changing it keeps the same
13:08
you could also say stay
13:11
stay the same stay the same
13:16
keep the same keep don't change don't
13:19
change
13:20
you keep the same so think about it this
13:22
eiffel tower
13:23
has been in paris france for a long time
13:26
the city has changed but the eiffel
13:29
tower
13:30
has kept the same and
13:33
keep kept kept so it's an irregular verb
13:36
keep cap paris has changed
13:39
but the eiffel tower has kept the same
13:43
okay so keep kept kept okay that wraps
13:46
up the words
13:47
let's do the exercises the first
13:49
exercise we're doing here
13:51
is word groups so what we have here
13:54
are four word groups right two words of
13:58
the group
13:58
and then we have to choose the word
14:01
write the word
14:02
from the box that best finishes
14:05
each word group so we have two words
14:08
here
14:08
what's the next word that is part of
14:11
that
14:11
group what words go together the words
14:14
are
14:15
first healthy healthy
14:18
then rest rest
14:23
muscle muscle and
14:26
tired tired oh piggle nail okay
14:30
okay so the first one exercise apples
14:34
carrots
14:34
apples carrots what word here best
14:38
belongs to these other two words apples
14:41
and carrots
14:42
are of course healthy so the word here
14:45
is healthy apples carrots healthy
14:48
okay that would be the best word from
14:51
the box to go in here two
14:55
bone heart then something think about it
14:58
in your body
14:59
you have bones you have a heart what
15:02
else do you have in your body
15:05
what else is in your body of course
15:07
muscle
15:08
muscles are in your body muscle
15:12
three break nap if you take a break
15:16
you take a nap what are you doing you're
15:19
resting
15:20
take a rest take a break take a nap take
15:23
a rest okay number four yawn
15:26
yawn we didn't go over that but yawn
15:28
what is yawn
15:30
yawn is when you do this
15:34
oh pico nail right if you if i yawn
15:37
maybe you yawn too
15:38
right it's like a cold it it goes from
15:42
one person to another
15:43
but i hope you're not sleepy now okay
15:45
i'm just showing you the example
15:47
that's a yawn when people yawn they're
15:50
sleepy
15:51
or they are tired so when people are
15:54
tired or sleepy
15:55
they yawn okay the next one
15:58
now this is a little bit different this
16:00
is to choose the word circle the words
16:03
that are the same
16:04
as the word in bold print remember
16:08
bold print is darker
16:11
wider letters okay this is bold print
16:14
so we have to look at the word in bold
16:16
print and circle
16:18
right circle the words that are the same
16:21
so we have the sentence here what word
16:23
is the same as energy we need to
16:25
circle that so number one she has the
16:29
power to work
16:30
because she eats well in this sentence
16:34
what word is the same as energy
16:37
energy well energy is power
16:40
isn't it if you chose that word that's
16:42
the right answer
16:43
she has the energy to work because she
16:46
eats well
16:47
or she has the power to work
16:50
because she eats well we can use either
16:53
word
16:53
in this case okay they're the same
16:57
number two too much salt
17:00
is not good for you so we're looking for
17:03
a word
17:04
or words that mean the same as bad and
17:07
we need to circle those
17:08
so bad is what that is good
17:12
bad is no not good it's the opposite ah
17:15
but here's
17:16
not so we can circle them together
17:19
right and we can say not good is the
17:21
same as bad
17:23
too much salt is bad for you
17:26
so we can substitute see okay
17:30
okay two more for the same same idea
17:33
here we have junk food so we're looking
17:36
for a word
17:37
or words a group of words that mean the
17:40
same as
17:41
junk food the sentence is i
17:44
don't eat food that is bad
17:47
for my body i don't eat food
17:51
that is bad for my body in this sentence
17:54
what are the word or words that mean the
17:56
same as junk food
17:58
well we know junk is not good junk is
18:01
bad
18:02
so we need to include this bad here but
18:05
food of course food is here and
18:08
basically
18:08
junk food is food that
18:12
is bad okay food that is bad
18:15
well for your body you could circle that
18:17
too but basically food that is bad
18:20
is junk food okay
18:23
build remember to build to make
18:26
something right
18:27
i drink milk to make my bones
18:30
strong okay so build and make are the
18:33
same
18:34
right but you could also do this right
18:37
you could also circle both of them if
18:39
you wanted to i drink milk
18:41
to make my bones if you said to make
18:44
your bones
18:44
yeah but to make your bones strong to
18:46
build them well
18:47
okay you could use one or the other or
18:50
together
18:51
make something strong is to build it
18:53
okay
18:54
but also just to make something also
18:56
means to build something
18:58
okay so those are our words that wraps
19:00
up the end of the vocabulary section
19:02
we're going to take a short break come
19:03
back and look at the reading together so
19:06
don't go away
19:10
you
