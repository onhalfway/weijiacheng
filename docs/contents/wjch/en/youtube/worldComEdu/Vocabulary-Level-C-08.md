what that means later
and we're going to learn about music

so what are some music trends in the
1990s
before we do that you know we could talk
about 1990s music trends
in korea what was a trend in korea very
popular one
do you know these guys right is it
idol right and the boys
right they were very famous in the 1990s
maybe you don't know them
you were too young right but maybe you
heard about them right
where are they now do you know are they
old men like me
i don't know but it's interesting every
generation has a different uh
style or trend right your trend
i'm sorry will be gone in about 10 years
but there will be a new trend that will
come up
so trends constantly change okay so
before we talk about the reading passage
though let's talk about some
words let's learn some vocabulary
number one foolish now this man looks
very foolish right
it's very foolish for a grown man to be
riding
a tricycle this is a tricycle
not a bicycle but a tricycle a tricycle
is for
kids not old men he looks very foolish
we could also say ridiculous
ridiculous ridiculous
okay this man wearing a hat
has a tie he's riding a tricycle that's
ridiculous it's foolish okay next one
number two happy and energetic what can
we say about this woman right she looks
happy
she looks energetic she looks upbeat
upbeat is happy or energetic
if you say that i feel upbeat today
that means that you're happy and you
have lots of energy
okay next one what's this guy doing
he's trying to look like something else
what is he
trying to look like maybe an ape or
maybe a monkey right
so what is he doing he's trying to look
like something else
he's trying to be like something else he
is
imitating imitate imitate
means to try and look like something
else you
imitate like an animal or you
imitate another person right so kids
will do this a lot even
adults will do that we see something you
know maybe we're playing
so we pretend we're like a monkey or
some other animal
we're imitating that or sometimes people
look at other people and say wow that
person's really
cool that person is really interesting i
want to be
like that person so they will imitate
that other person so you can imitate
animals you can imitate
people okay next one what's going on
here
she's wearing jeans that fit her body
they're tight but these jeans are huge
they're very big
so not tight there's a special word for
that
we can say baggy but baggy really refers
to like
a style of fashion if this woman
puts on these jeans i would not say
they're baggy
i'd say they're too big they'll fall
down right
baggy jeans would be okay on her waist
but they would be very
wide on the legs right and a baggy shirt
is a shirt that's too big and it's very
loose
on her so baggy clothes it's a
fashion style we'll talk about that
later
but baggy not tight very loose fitting
clothes very loose
fitting loose
fitting clothes are baggy clothes
so are your clothes tight or your
clothes loose
are they baggy okay next one
this is a good picture to show it's a
stage
in a process of change
this of course is the moon and if we
look at the moon
we know that the moon changes shape in
the sky
there's different uh stages we can say
phase what phase is the moon in
we have the full moon right
full moon whoops full moon
we have half moon
and although it's kind of weird to look
at it right uh this would be no moon
because we don't see that right that's
when the earth's light is reflected in
the moon it's kind of like this one here
right okay we don't see the moon in the
sky okay
so full moon half moon no moon those are
the phases of the moon
and they change every month don't they
so depending on the month
you can see full moon half moon or no
moon
and that is the phase of the moon but
we're talking about the moon here
but if you think about it many things go
through a phase
you go through phases human beings go
through phases
we have different stages uh
baby child teenager
young adult middle aged adult and old
person
these are all stages we all go through
phases
not just people but all living things
right
animals insects plants they all have
phases okay okay next one
happening unexpectedly this poor woman
right
she looks like she's in new york it's
raining she doesn't
have an umbrella be why because it's
suddenly it suddenly started to rain
maybe she didn't know she didn't have
any idea was going to rain so she didn't
carry an umbrella now it's suddenly
raining she's getting wet it's a very
very poor situation very sad situation
okay next one oh that was fast to feel
sorry i regret hitting the button too
fast but that's okay i don't regret that
too much
okay when you feel sorry about something
especially when you did something wrong
to another person
right then you regret what you've done
when you have done something wrong you
feel sorry about your actions
you regret your actions i'm sorry i did
that
i regret doing that okay that's when you
feel
sorry about your actions something you
did next one
oh what does this man look like he looks
calm and
gentle no okay he's mellow
mellow that's an interesting words
rhymes with yellow
right mellow yellow okay mellow
if you say something is mellow it's very
calm
it's very gentle very laid back you
could also say laid back
laid back right calm
gentle no stress it's very mellow oh
very cool
right very gentle very mellow
okay feeling um now this guy looks like
he's
sad or bored but that's not the feeling
we're looking for
we're looking for another word that
means
feeling and that of course is mood right
it when we talk about mood we're talking
about feeling
for example are you in a good mood if
you're in a good mood
you feel happy uh you're happy you're
energetic you're in a good mood
or oh be careful the teacher
is in a bad mood a bad mood
a bad mood somebody is upset or
angry or stressed out so you can be in a
good mood
or you can be in a bad mood it talks
about
what are you feeling these days what uh
how do you feel
okay so i'm in a good mood i'm in a bad
mood
depending on your feeling okay
well what's going on here uh informal
words
used by particular people now this is
kind of funny because
the word we're looking for is slang but
it doesn't just mean that people who
look like this guy
use slang everybody uses slang right
and some stage of their life right
in some part of their life everybody
uses slang
slang is just really informal words
informal words like if i say um
hey hey bra hey dude right
instead of saying hello uh to a person a
man i don't call him a man
i call him a dude dude is more it's like
slang
hey dude what's up how's it hanging
right
what's hanging you know what's going on
um that would be slang
okay maybe i'm getting old i'm
forgetting all my slang but anyway
slang is informal words words that are
not formal and we use slang with your
friends
it's not proper to use slang
when you're at work or when you're
talking to your teacher
or when you're talking to your parents
usually slang is used
among friends okay next one
this is kind of funny is a cute little
kid right his
his clothes are way too big for him his
shoes are
really big not tight loose
remember when we talked about baggy very
similar
right baggy whoops
whoa whoa stop okay baggy baggy and
loose are very
similar together right it just means
they're not tight
it's not tight it's loose or
baggy okay twelve
to have something on your body so
she looks actually like a model she's
what is she doing though this is a
an interesting looking dress isn't it
what is she doing she's
wearing this dress now be careful with
wear
okay wear means that you have
something on your body it doesn't mean
that you put it on
right that's different if you say what
will you wear
today that means what are you wearing
what are you wearing that means what are
you wearing now what is on your body
but in the morning you put on clothes
put on clothes so you can say i will put
on a shirt
right i will put on shoes and then
during the day you
wear those clothes okay so where
where is an irregular verb it
changes form for the past so we say
where war worn
where war worn okay next one
well what are these guys doing here the
part of the body that
bends in the center of the leg so these
people are not
standing right they're kind of on their
what
on this part of the the leg that bends
in the middle we call that
the knee knee so i'm talking about what
are these guys doing here
they're not standing on their feet they
are
kneeling to kneel that's interesting
this is a verb
to kneel it's when you stand on your
knees right you
get off your feet and you're like this
that is to kneel and you can see
it comes from knee right because they're
on their knees
so knee is the part of your leg
this part here and if you sit down and
are just on your knees then you are
kneeling to kneel and you can see it
comes from that word
knee interesting okay
of course you have one of this in your
book bag or in your room at home i hope
so
this is a book that tells you
what words mean of course you should
have one in your
in in the korean language but maybe you
have a korean english one
too that says what words in korean what
do they mean
or what word is it in english right what
is it
it's of course a dictionary
dictionary dictionary so it's actually
four
four sounds dictionary
dictionary dictionary and that of course
is a book
that tells you what words mean if you
want to know what a word means
you look it up look
it up in
a dictionary look it up
in a dictionary what does this word mean
i don't know
look it up in a dictionary okay
whoa cool guy right okay
music in which words are spoken fast
it's a type of music where people say
the words very fast and
actually it's kind of like poetry
but they're singing the words and they
sing them very quickly
what is it you know it's rap rap
is a musical style it's actually a
singing style
where people sing the words very quickly
okay
it's like somebody you know it's not
just like reading a poem it's like
reading a poem to music
into a beat and very quickly and many of
the words rhyme
in other words they sound similar okay
last we have to imitate this guy looks
like
johnny depp from pirates of the
caribbean right
so he's imitating johnny depp and we
talked about this to copy
so remember we talked about imitate
before to act like somebody else or to
act like something else we said that's
to imitate
but we can also say it means also to
copy
so you can copy the behavior of an
animal
or you can copy the behavior or the
dress
or the style of another person and that
is to copy
okay let's talk about our the vocabulary
exercises
here we have synonyms remember what a
synonym means
it means a word that has a similar
meaning to
another word a synonym match the words
in the box
with their synonyms listed below
synonyms
same or similar meaning okay so our
words are
in the box phase imitate
suddenly regret those are words
four words now we have to match these
words
to their synonyms and down here we have
copy
repent abruptly
and stage okay so
number one copy well that's easy right
because we learned both of those words
as part of the vocabulary
first we learned one word and then we
learned copy
remember i just talked about when you
copy something
you're behaving very similar to somebody
else you are
what you are imitating them so copy and
imitate have similar meanings they're
very
close to meaning they're the same thing
okay
to copy to is to imitate now number two
is a little hinduro
because repent we didn't learn that word
repent
so look it up in your dictionary if you
do
you will find out that it means
something here i will i will define what
repent means
repent is something let's say you do
something
and you feel sorry about what you did so
you repent
you say oh i wish i didn't do that i'm
really sorry
i'm sorry i did that so if you are sorry
about something you did
if you are sorry about your actions what
word means that
ah here regret you regret what you did
repent is regret
okay next one three abruptly again
abruptly
means something happens and it's not
expected
something happens quickly you don't
expect it so what word did we learn
that means something happens
unexpectedly
it of course means suddenly suddenly
abruptly and suddenly are the same
meaning here we have stage
okay now we learned the word stage and
part of the definition for stage
was this other word they use this other
word and the other word of course was
phase and i talked about phases of the
moon actually this was the word we
learned right and stage was in the
definition
so we talked about the moon there are
different stages
or phases of the moon and there
also we talk about people or any living
thing
all living things go through different
stages
okay that's synonyms what about
antonyms antonym means
the opposite so synonym means the same
antonym is opposite pandero
right so match the words in the box with
their
antonyms opposite meanings listed below
the words that we studied are ridiculous
ridiculous mellow
upbeat and baggy
okay i didn't repeat all those but
ridiculous mellow
upbeat and baggy these are the words
that are
the antonyms of the words in the box
number one we have violent
violent is something that
is uh of course very aggressive very
angry and really you know or
bad so somebody who is violent is the
opposite
of what opposite pandero what is the
opposite of violent here
the opposite of violent would be mello
remember mello means calm and gentle
gentle is the opposite of violent so you
can have a violent person
or you can have a gentle person they are
opposites
two sad what is the opposite of sad what
word did we look at that we learn
that is the opposite of sad which word
up here means
happy and energetic that word of course
is
upbeat and of course that would be the
opposite of sad
somebody who's sad is not happy they're
not energetic right
they're just sad okay three sensible
now we didn't learn that word okay but
we're looking for the opposite
of sensible what does sensible mean if
we look it up in the dictionary
you will see that sensible means acting
in a uh a normal ordinary way or
using common sense right in other words
acting in the proper way
if you see a man in a business suit who
is being very polite to other people
he's being sensible
but if you see a man in the business
suit riding a little tricycle
right that's not sensible that's very
silly
that's what it's ridiculous
it's ridiculous so sensible and
ridiculous
are opposites antonyms
number four is tight that's very easy
we we looked at that as part of the
definition for one of the words
we saw the woman wearing tight jeans and
she was holding some very big jeans
that would be what they would be baggy
on her
so tight and baggy are opposites or
antonyms okay so that's a review of
these words here
now that you have a good idea of what
these words mean
we'll see them in the reading passage
let's go over that
in just a few moments okay
you

imitating imitate imitate

03:01
will do this a lot even
03:03
adults will do that we see something you
03:05
know maybe we're playing
03:06
so we pretend we're like a monkey or
03:08
some other animal
03:10
we're imitating that or sometimes people
03:13
look at other people and say wow that
03:14
person's really
03:15
cool that person is really interesting i
03:18
want to be
03:19

03:22
that other person so you can imitate
03:25
animals you can imitate
03:26
people okay next one what's going on
03:30
here
03:31
she's wearing jeans that fit her body
03:34
they're tight but these jeans are huge
03:37
they're very big
03:38
so not tight there's a special word for
03:41
that
03:41
we can say baggy but baggy really refers
03:45
to like
03:46
a style of fashion if this woman
03:49
puts on these jeans i would not say
03:52
they're baggy
03:53
i'd say they're too big they'll fall
03:55
down right
03:57
baggy jeans would be okay on her waist
04:00
but they would be very
04:01
wide on the legs right and a baggy shirt
04:04
is a shirt that's too big and it's very
04:06
loose
04:06
on her so baggy clothes it's a
04:10
fashion style we'll talk about that
04:12
later
04:13
but baggy not tight very loose fitting
04:16
clothes very loose
04:20
fitting loose
04:24
fitting clothes are baggy clothes
04:27
so are your clothes tight or your
04:29
clothes loose
04:30
are they baggy okay next one
04:34
this is a good picture to show it's a
04:36
stage
04:37
in a process of change
04:41
this of course is the moon and if we
04:43
look at the moon
04:44
we know that the moon changes shape in
04:47
the sky
04:48
there's different uh stages we can say
04:52
phase what phase is the moon in
04:55
we have the full moon right
04:59
full moon whoops full moon
05:02
we have half moon
05:06
and although it's kind of weird to look
05:09
at it right uh this would be no moon
05:12
because we don't see that right that's
05:14
when the earth's light is reflected in
05:16
the moon it's kind of like this one here
05:18
right okay we don't see the moon in the
05:20
sky okay
05:21
so full moon half moon no moon those are
05:23
the phases of the moon
05:25
and they change every month don't they
05:28
so depending on the month
05:29
you can see full moon half moon or no
05:32
moon
05:33
and that is the phase of the moon but
05:36
we're talking about the moon here
05:38
but if you think about it many things go
05:41
through a phase
05:42
you go through phases human beings go
05:44
through phases
05:45
we have different stages uh

08:56
the word we're looking for is slang but
08:58
it doesn't just mean that people who
09:00
look like this guy
09:01
use slang everybody uses slang right
09:04
and some stage of their life right
09:07
in some part of their life everybody
09:09
uses slang
09:10
slang is just really informal words
09:14
informal words like if i say um
09:18
hey hey bra hey dude right
09:21
instead of saying hello uh to a person a
09:24
man i don't call him a man
09:26
i call him a dude dude is more it's like
09:30
slang
09:30
hey dude what's up how's it hanging
09:34
right
09:34
what's hanging you know what's going on
09:36
um that would be slang
09:38
okay maybe i'm getting old i'm
09:39
forgetting all my slang but anyway
09:41
slang is informal words words that are
09:44
not formal and we use slang with your
09:46
friends
09:47
it's not proper to use slang
09:50
when you're at work or when you're
09:52
talking to your teacher
09:53
or when you're talking to your parents
09:55
usually slang is used
09:57
among friends okay next one
10:00
this is kind of funny is a cute little
10:02
kid right his
10:04
his clothes are way too big for him his
10:06
shoes are
10:07
really big not tight loose
10:10
remember when we talked about baggy very
10:13
similar
10:14
right baggy whoops
10:17
whoa whoa stop okay baggy baggy and
10:20
loose are very
10:21
similar together right it just means
10:23
they're not tight
10:24
it's not tight it's loose or
10:28
baggy okay twelve
10:31
to have something on your body so
10:34
she looks actually like a model she's
10:37
what is she doing though this is a
10:39
an interesting looking dress isn't it
10:41
what is she doing she's
10:42
wearing this dress now be careful with
10:46
wear
10:46
okay wear means that you have
10:50
something on your body it doesn't mean
10:53
that you put it on
10:55
right that's different if you say what
10:58
will you wear
10:59
today that means what are you wearing
11:01
what are you wearing that means what are
11:02
you wearing now what is on your body
11:05
but in the morning you put on clothes
11:09
put on clothes so you can say i will put
11:12
on a shirt
11:13
right i will put on shoes and then
11:15
during the day you
11:16
wear those clothes okay so where
11:19
where is an irregular verb it
11:22
changes form for the past so we say
11:26
where war worn
11:29
where war worn okay next one
11:33
well what are these guys doing here the
11:35
part of the body that
11:37
bends in the center of the leg so these
11:40
people are not
11:40
standing right they're kind of on their
11:43
what
11:44
on this part of the the leg that bends
11:46
in the middle we call that
11:48
the knee knee so i'm talking about what
11:50
are these guys doing here
11:52
they're not standing on their feet they
11:55
are
11:57
kneeling to kneel that's interesting
12:00
this is a verb
12:01
to kneel it's when you stand on your
12:04
knees right you
12:05
get off your feet and you're like this
12:07
that is to kneel and you can see
12:09
it comes from knee right because they're
12:12
on their knees
12:13
so knee is the part of your leg
12:16
this part here and if you sit down and
12:19
are just on your knees then you are
12:23
kneeling to kneel and you can see it
12:25
comes from that word
12:26
knee interesting okay
12:30
of course you have one of this in your
12:33
book bag or in your room at home i hope
12:35
so
12:36
this is a book that tells you
12:39
what words mean of course you should
12:41
have one in your
12:42
in in the korean language but maybe you
12:45
have a korean english one
12:46
too that says what words in korean what
12:49
do they mean
12:50
or what word is it in english right what
12:53
is it
12:53
it's of course a dictionary
12:56
dictionary dictionary so it's actually
13:00
four
13:01
four sounds dictionary
13:04
dictionary dictionary and that of course
13:07
is a book
13:07
that tells you what words mean if you
13:09
want to know what a word means
13:11
you look it up look
13:15
it up in
13:18
a dictionary look it up
13:22
in a dictionary what does this word mean
13:24
i don't know
13:25
look it up in a dictionary okay
13:29
whoa cool guy right okay
13:33
music in which words are spoken fast
13:37
it's a type of music where people say
13:40
the words very fast and
13:41
actually it's kind of like poetry
13:46
but they're singing the words and they
13:48
sing them very quickly
13:50
what is it you know it's rap rap
13:53
is a musical style it's actually a
13:55
singing style
13:56
where people sing the words very quickly
13:59
okay
14:00
it's like somebody you know it's not
14:01
just like reading a poem it's like
14:03
reading a poem to music
14:04
into a beat and very quickly and many of
14:07
the words rhyme
14:08
in other words they sound similar okay
14:12
last we have to imitate this guy looks
14:15
like
14:16
johnny depp from pirates of the
14:17
caribbean right
14:19
so he's imitating johnny depp and we
14:22
talked about this to copy
14:24
so remember we talked about imitate
14:26
before to act like somebody else or to
14:28
act like something else we said that's
14:30
to imitate
14:31
but we can also say it means also to
14:34
copy
14:34
so you can copy the behavior of an
14:37
animal
14:37
or you can copy the behavior or the
14:40
dress
14:41
or the style of another person and that
14:44
is to copy
14:45
okay let's talk about our the vocabulary
14:49
exercises
14:50
here we have synonyms remember what a
14:53
synonym means
14:54
it means a word that has a similar
14:56
meaning to
14:58
another word a synonym match the words
15:01
in the box
15:02
with their synonyms listed below
15:05
synonyms
15:06
same or similar meaning okay so our
15:10
words are
15:11
in the box phase imitate
15:15
suddenly regret those are words
15:18
four words now we have to match these
15:21
words
15:22
to their synonyms and down here we have
15:25
copy
15:26
repent abruptly
15:29
and stage okay so
15:32
number one copy well that's easy right
15:35
because we learned both of those words
15:37
as part of the vocabulary
15:38
first we learned one word and then we
15:41
learned copy
15:42
remember i just talked about when you
15:44
copy something
15:45
you're behaving very similar to somebody
15:48
else you are
15:49
what you are imitating them so copy and
15:52
imitate have similar meanings they're
15:55
very
15:55
close to meaning they're the same thing
15:58
okay
15:59
to copy to is to imitate now number two
16:02
is a little hinduro
16:03
because repent we didn't learn that word
16:06
repent
16:07
so look it up in your dictionary if you
16:10
do
16:10
you will find out that it means
16:12
something here i will i will define what
16:14
repent means
16:15
repent is something let's say you do
16:18
something
16:19
and you feel sorry about what you did so
16:21
you repent
16:22
you say oh i wish i didn't do that i'm
16:25
really sorry
16:26
i'm sorry i did that so if you are sorry
16:29
about something you did
16:31
if you are sorry about your actions what
16:34
word means that
16:36
ah here regret you regret what you did
16:39
repent is regret
16:42
okay next one three abruptly again
16:45
abruptly
16:46
means something happens and it's not
16:49
expected
16:50
something happens quickly you don't
16:52
expect it so what word did we learn
16:55
that means something happens
16:57
unexpectedly
16:58
it of course means suddenly suddenly
17:02
abruptly and suddenly are the same
17:05
meaning here we have stage
17:08
okay now we learned the word stage and
17:11
part of the definition for stage
17:14
was this other word they use this other
17:16
word and the other word of course was
17:18
phase and i talked about phases of the
17:21
moon actually this was the word we
17:22
learned right and stage was in the
17:24
definition
17:25
so we talked about the moon there are
17:27
different stages
17:29
or phases of the moon and there
17:32
also we talk about people or any living
17:35
thing
17:36
all living things go through different
17:38
stages
17:40
okay that's synonyms what about
17:44
antonyms antonym means
17:47
the opposite so synonym means the same
17:50
antonym is opposite pandero
17:53
right so match the words in the box with
17:57
their
17:57
antonyms opposite meanings listed below
18:02
the words that we studied are ridiculous
18:05
ridiculous mellow
18:08
upbeat and baggy
18:11
okay i didn't repeat all those but
18:13
ridiculous mellow
18:14
upbeat and baggy these are the words
18:18
that are
18:18
the antonyms of the words in the box
18:22
number one we have violent
18:26
violent is something that
18:29
is uh of course very aggressive very
18:32
angry and really you know or
18:36
bad so somebody who is violent is the
18:39
opposite
18:40
of what opposite pandero what is the
18:42
opposite of violent here
18:44
the opposite of violent would be mello
18:48
remember mello means calm and gentle
18:51
gentle is the opposite of violent so you
18:54
can have a violent person
18:56
or you can have a gentle person they are
18:58
opposites
19:00
two sad what is the opposite of sad what
19:04
word did we look at that we learn
19:06
that is the opposite of sad which word
19:08
up here means
19:10
happy and energetic that word of course
19:13
is
19:13
upbeat and of course that would be the
19:15
opposite of sad
19:17
somebody who's sad is not happy they're
19:19
not energetic right
19:21
they're just sad okay three sensible
19:25
now we didn't learn that word okay but
19:27
we're looking for the opposite
19:28
of sensible what does sensible mean if
19:31
we look it up in the dictionary
19:33
you will see that sensible means acting
19:36
in a uh a normal ordinary way or
19:40
using common sense right in other words
19:44
acting in the proper way
19:45
if you see a man in a business suit who
19:49
is being very polite to other people
19:51
he's being sensible
19:53
but if you see a man in the business
19:55
suit riding a little tricycle
19:57
right that's not sensible that's very
20:00
silly
20:00
that's what it's ridiculous
20:03
it's ridiculous so sensible and
20:05
ridiculous
20:06
are opposites antonyms
20:10
number four is tight that's very easy
20:13
we we looked at that as part of the
20:15
definition for one of the words
20:17
we saw the woman wearing tight jeans and
20:20
she was holding some very big jeans
20:22
that would be what they would be baggy
20:25
on her
20:26
so tight and baggy are opposites or
20:29
antonyms okay so that's a review of
20:32
these words here
20:33
now that you have a good idea of what
20:35
these words mean
20:36
we'll see them in the reading passage
20:38
let's go over that
20:39
in just a few moments okay
20:48
you
