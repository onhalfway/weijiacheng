hello everybody
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
we're still continuing the theme of
heroes
and in lesson 14 our title is
a dream come true in this lesson
we will focus on martin luther king
jr do you know him he was a hero
who fought for people's rights so in
this lesson
we're going to learn about martin luther
king
jr an important hero in american history
uh first of all who is martin luther
king
jr he is this man here and in this
picture he is giving a speech
in washington dc and there are thousands
and thousands of people who have come
to hear him speak he is very famous
for his speech i have a dream
perhaps you've heard of that speech
before it's the speech
in which he calls for equality
between black people and white people
and in fact for people of all races
and all colors to be equal and to be
treated equal under the law so he's a
very
important person in american history and
that is martin luther king
okay we're going to read a passage about
him but we need to learn
some words first so let's begin with
word number one a wish now
this poor kid is in school right and
he doesn't want to be in school he
doesn't want to study
he's thinking about playing soccer right
so he has a wish he has a dream
to go outside and play soccer
do you have a dream we all have dreams
we all wish we could do something we all
dreamed that we could do
something else perhaps but some dreams
are
better than other dreams right dreaming
to go out to play
soccer yeah that's a common dream but
dreaming for a better world
that's a much better dream that's a much
better wish
and we use wish we use dream
when it seems very difficult to get
what we want right when you say i
dream of doing something that means it's
going to be hard
it's going to be very difficult it might
be
impossible to get it but you dream about
it
it's a wish it's different from saying
hope hope is something
a little easier to get for example
i hope it rains tomorrow
probably it will rain tomorrow probably
so i hope it rains tomorrow
but if there's no chance of rain it's
going to be sunny every day
they say oh i wish it would rain
tomorrow okay
so wish or dream is for something that
seems impossible
hope is for something that seems a
little more possible
okay next one
to think of something from the past
when you think of something from the
past what are you doing
you are of course remembering remember
remember can you remember
what you did last year can you remember
what you did
last week can you remember what you did
this morning
i hope so okay what did you have for
breakfast
this morning can you remember if you
think about
something in the past you're remembering
okay number three to come together with
to come together with if all of these
people
come together what are they doing they
are joining
to join join together
to join you can just say join you don't
have to say
join together you just need to say to
join
okay number four number four is not
scared have you ever done this what is
this person doing
this person is bun g
jump bing bungy
jumping bungee jumping right
did you ever do that i did a long time
ago
and i was scared but you have to
get over your fear you have to be
not scared right if you're not scared
you are brave you have to be brave
to go bungee jumping right you have to
be brave
you have to be not scared you must be
brave
okay next one five not
together sad story right yojachingu
namja chingu
they're fighting right so they're
looking at each they're looking away
from each other
they're not together now they're not
together they
are apart apart
together apart so if people are together
they're with each other they're sitting
together they're also thinking together
but if they're apart right they're not
close to each other
and maybe they're thinking different
ways so together
apart pandiro okay number six
to make somebody feel unhappy
to make someone feel unhappy
is upset to make someone
upset you can also use it as a verb
i upset him i
upset him
that means i made him angry
i made him unhappy i
upset him or to make someone upset
upset we say upset upset upset
okay it doesn't change for past
tense uh he upset me yesterday he upset
me
have you upset your brother right so
it's
always upset we don't change it in the
past tense it's an irregular verb
number seven a rule made by a government
so when the government makes a rule and
everybody has to
follow that rule what is the rule it is
a law a law you should follow the law
or obey the law you must obey the law
because if you break the law if you
break the law
then the police catch you and you have
to pay money
or go to jail so you should follow the
law
obey the laws laws are rules made by
a government rules
are just made by everybody we can make
rules if we play a game
let's make some rules we don't make laws
only the government makes laws okay so
that's the difference between a law and
a rule
rules are you know anybody can make a
rule but
laws are made by the government okay
eight the same the same so it looks like
here we have a big heart and we have
many little hearts
but they weigh the same if something is
the same
we can say it's equal equal
these two things now they're different
but they weigh the same
their weight is equal right
so even though some two things or many
things they might look different
they can be equal in some ways
right they're different in in these ways
but they're equal
in other ways that's an important idea
equal okay so they are equal
oh what happened right we have a car
accident
now if a car accident takes place or
really
anything takes place what do we say it
happens so bad things happen
right unfortunately some bad things
happen
some good things happen too happen now
this picture looks like a
negative situation but happen is not a
negative word
it's a neutral word because good things
happen
and bad things happen it just means
it took place it happened right
if you get an a on your test that
happens
if you break a window that happens so
many different things
happen they occur they take
place to happen okay number ten
one and the other so we're talking about
one here right one and
the other so one and the other they are
what we say
both both not just one not
only the other one but both together
both
both of them so one and the other
are both okay next one
to rest on your bottom on your bottom
bottom is a polite word for your ondongy
right okay don't say hip
don't say hip because hip is on the side
hip is not your bottom you have a hip on
this a right hip
and left hip you have hips are on the
side
hip is on the side bottom is on the
bottom you sit down on your bottom
don't sit on your hip that's hymdro and
that's painful
up by oh right you shouldn't sit on your
hip sit on your bottom
okay to rest on your bottom of course
sit and sit is an irregular verb
so we say sit sat sat sit
sat sat ah let's sit down here
oh i sat here yesterday have you
ever sat here right uh did you ever s
uh i have i have sat here before for
example okay
so sit sat sat okay to rest on your
bottom okay okay that's a polite word
okay number 12
the part that faces forward so the part
of a person
or a building that faces forward it's
the
what is it it's the front part of
something
so of course if you look at a house this
is the front
part of the house that's the part that
faces forward to the street
when you come to the house you see the
front of the house
when you look at a person you see the
front of the person
not the back right well unless they turn
their back right
but you look at a person usually you
look at their front their face
so that's the front the front of a
person the front of a
building the front of a car it's the
part that faces
forward okay not
different we talked about this a little
bit
before it's kind of similar we have a
father and a son
and yes they are different in some ways
but they are also
the same because they're wearing the
same cap
they're the same family this is the
father this is the son
right in fact there's an interesting
expression in english
like father like father
comma like son
what this means is that the son
will grow up to be like the father or
the son behaves like the father
so the son and the father behave in the
same way or they look
the same way so if they're not different
they are the same yes
one is an old older man not an old man
but he's older one is a baby
they're different in size but they're
the same they're the same family
right there's in some ways they're the
same in some ways they're different
but if you say something is not
different they're the same or the other
word we
learned earlier equal right same or
equal
number 14 planet earth
the planet earth what is it we say it's
the world
right this is the world or earth
or planet earth it's the earth on which
we live it's
our world okay
15 true or false well if something is
not false
it is of course true right it's right
there for you
right so if something is not false
not a lie not an untruth
then it is true right it is true
what's true of course if it is true
uh it is real it is the actual situation
it's true next one is 16
to move to where the speaker is so if
you're going to move from here
to where the speaker is what are you
doing you are
coming okay so if i'm the speaker
and you move to me i say you are coming
here
right or you say i will come to you
right i will come to you
i will come to you
right or please come here please come
here
so to move to where the speaker is to is
to come
and it's an irregular verb come came
come
come came come okay so when we talk
about in the past we use
uh cain for simple past uh i came here
yesterday
uh have you come here before okay have
you come here before
okay now let's go over the words the
word exercises
vocabulary exercises these are our
words dream upset join and laws
we need to write the word next to its
meaning so we need to write these words
next to the word that has the same
meaning
the words again are dream dream
upset upset join
join and laws
laws let's look at the number one one is
rules
okay so what did we talk about before
there are rules but a rule that is made
by the government is a special kind of
rule it
is a law so rules and laws have
similar meanings they're different yeah
they mean different things
but they are similar rules made by the
government
are laws okay number two
a wish when you wish for something
you have what you have a dream you have
a dream when you wish for something
three unhappy if somebody is
unhappy right they are what they are of
course
upset and upset can also be used as a
verb
not just an adjective he is upset
that's adjective but i upset him
that's a verb so unhappy and upset
are similar meanings of course unhappy
is only an adjective
four come together with when you come
together with something many people
come together they join they join
together
they get together they join together
okay we also have another type of
exercise here
now this is opposites not similar
words but opposite words words that have
the opposite meaning what we need to do
here is circle
right it says circle the word so we need
to circle right
the word or words it could be one word
or it could be two words
in the sentence that are opposite
of the word in bold print this is bold
print
this is bold print so what we need to do
is look at the sentence and find the
part of the sentence
that is the opposite of the word
in bold print number one
the word in bold print is apart
apart the sentence is she
always has fun when they are together
now which word in this sentence is the
opposite
pandero of the word apart remember apart
pandero together so this is it right
here
we should circle this word she always
has fun when they are together
pandiro apart okay number two
the word is upset upset
the sentence john is very happy
to see his grandfather
john is very happy to see his
grandfather so which
word in this sentence is the opposite
of upset which word is the opposite
well upset is the same meaning as
unhappy right on means not
not happy so happy is the opposite
of upset right very simple
okay next one number three our word is
brave brave
sentence jane was scared of the big dog
if you see a big dog right you are what
you are scared right now scared
that's the opposite of brave right brave
means
to be not scared so scared
and brave are opposites they mean
different things
opposite things okay number four
the word is remember
remember remember the sentence is
i forget which street he lives on
i forget which street he lives on
so remember means to think about the
past to know
something from the past but if you can't
think about the past or you something in
the past you can't think of it
that means you forgot it right so forget
means the opposite of remember remember
and forget
are different they are opposites okay
so interesting exercise okay those are
our two vocabulary exercises
for the words let's take a short break
we'll come back and look at the reading

hope hope is something

03:03
going to be sunny every day
03:04
they say oh i wish it would rain
03:06
tomorrow okay

05:37
to make somebody feel unhappy
05:40
to make someone feel unhappy
05:43
is upset to make someone
05:47
upset you can also use it as a verb
05:50
i upset him i
05:53
upset him
05:58
that means i made him angry
06:01
i made him unhappy i
06:04
upset him or to make someone upset
06:09
upset we say upset upset upset
06:12
okay it doesn't change for past
06:15
tense uh he upset me yesterday he upset
06:19
me
06:20
have you upset your brother right so
06:23
it's
06:23
always upset we don't change it in the
06:26
past tense it's an irregular verb
06:29
number seven a rule made by a government
06:33
so when the government makes a rule and
06:36
everybody has to
06:37
follow that rule what is the rule it is
06:40
a law a law you should follow the law
06:44
or obey the law you must obey the law
06:48
because if you break the law if you
06:51
break the law
06:55
then the police catch you and you have
06:57
to pay money
06:58
or go to jail so you should follow the
07:01
law
07:02
obey the laws laws are rules made by
07:05
a government rules
07:08
are just made by everybody we can make
07:10
rules if we play a game
07:12
let's make some rules we don't make laws
07:16
only the government makes laws okay so
07:19
that's the difference between a law and
07:21
a rule
07:21
rules are you know anybody can make a
07:23
rule but
07:25
laws are made by the government okay
07:28
eight the same the same so it looks like
07:31
here we have a big heart and we have
07:33
many little hearts
07:35
but they weigh the same if something is
07:37
the same
07:38
we can say it's equal equal
07:42
these two things now they're different
07:44
but they weigh the same
07:46
their weight is equal right
07:49
so even though some two things or many
07:51
things they might look different
07:53
they can be equal in some ways
07:57
right they're different in in these ways
08:00
but they're equal
08:01
in other ways that's an important idea
08:04
equal okay so they are equal
08:08
oh what happened right we have a car
08:11
accident
08:12
now if a car accident takes place or
08:15
really
08:16
anything takes place what do we say it
08:19
happens so bad things happen
08:22
right unfortunately some bad things
08:25
happen
08:26
some good things happen too happen now
08:29
this picture looks like a
08:31
negative situation but happen is not a
08:34
negative word
08:35
it's a neutral word because good things
08:38
happen
08:39
and bad things happen it just means
08:42
it took place it happened right
08:46
if you get an a on your test that
08:48
happens
08:49
if you break a window that happens so
08:52
many different things
08:54
happen they occur they take
08:57
place to happen okay number ten
09:01
one and the other so we're talking about
09:05

09:11
what we say

10:30
okay number 12
10:32
the part that faces forward so the part
10:36
of a person
10:37
or a building that faces forward it's
10:40
the
10:40
what is it it's the front part of
10:43
something
10:43
so of course if you look at a house this
10:46
is the front
10:47
part of the house that's the part that
10:49
faces forward to the street
10:51
when you come to the house you see the
10:53
front of the house
10:54
when you look at a person you see the
10:56
front of the person
10:58
not the back right well unless they turn
11:00
their back right
11:01
but you look at a person usually you
11:03
look at their front their face
11:05
so that's the front the front of a
11:07
person the front of a
