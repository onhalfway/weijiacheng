hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading i'm brian stewart and today
we're looking at social studies
book 3 lesson 10 and in lesson 10 we're
talking about
producers and consumers
so in this lesson you will discover the
difference between
producers and consumers what are they
we'll also take a look at what producers
provide
okay now we have our vocabulary section
and our first word
is producer that's what we're talking
about right producers
and consumers so what is a producer
well a producer is a person who makes
goods who makes something by the way
producer is an interesting word because
you have the word here produce
produce is a verb
produce means to make
something to make something so if you
make
something you produce it you are a
producer
and now we have the er ending
er that means a person
aha so in english it's very interesting
if you take a verb and you add r or
er it makes it into a person
what are some examples for example
drive drive
if your father your mother drives a car
they are a driver
aha so drive a car a person
who drives is called a driver
and many words in english are similar to
this
so if you see the er ending you know ah
it's a
person probably who does the verb
right like producer or driver
not always but most of the time it means
a person who does something
in this case a person who makes
goods all right good next word
provide provide is a verb
to provide means to make something
available to someone to make it
available it's also like to give
something if you provide it you give it
but
really you make something available to
someone
now wait a minute remember what i just
said about verbs
do that with this one too if you put an
r
here ah that's a person
provider is a person who gives something
a provider
and a producer are very similar
in meaning a producer makes something a
provider gives
something okay interesting let's move on
product now product now product is a
noun it's a
thing a product is something that you
can hold
that you can use it's something that is
grown
like fruit or meat
something you can eat or it's
made for sale in a factory or
by hand so a product is a thing
a thing that you can actually touch and
feel maybe you can eat it
maybe you can sit in it maybe you can
drive it but it's a
thing it's a physical thing that you can
use
and it's either grown or made by
somebody
next word is a marketplace we just
talked about
products usually products are things
that you
buy right things that you can use you
can eat well
if you want to eat something you might
go to a market
place to buy something to eat
you could also go to a marketplace to
get clothes
right to wear those things and clothes
are a product too
so a marketplace is a place where people
buy and sell goods and services we'll
talk about that in a bit
but marketplace is actually two words
that have been combined right so we have
market and we have place so we have the
first word is market
and the second word is place place of
course is a location
right it's an area it's a specific place
you can go to
your school is a place but we don't call
it school place we just say school
but market a market is an area
where you can buy and sell things and
this has a very
old old tradition you know markets have
existed for
thousands of years so we just kind of
combine the two words
it's a place where you can buy and sell
things
it's a marketplace other words that are
like marketplace
of course store store means the same
thing a store or a supermarket
supermarket usually market was just a
place where
farmers sold fruit
vegetables meat things like that that
was the old
definition of a market but markets
developed they became
they they used to sell more and more
goods so now if you go to a market
or a supermarket you can buy anything
you buy paper you can buy shoes
you can buy shirts you can buy an apple
so it's a supermarket not just a market
where you buy
food but a supermarket you can buy
anything
at a supermarket so we call it super
supermarket
but it's also these are marketplaces
where you can buy
and sell goods and services okay
consumer ah we have another word that
ends in er
to consume means to well
the most common meaning of consume is to
eat
or drink but it can also mean to buy
or to use something so a consumer
is a person who buys goods or
services when you go to the store and
you buy something
you are a consumer okay
raw material is our last vocabulary
items two words raw material
raw means that it hasn't
been changed it's in its natural
state okay it's what you find
in nature we haven't changed it or we
haven't
made it into something else it's the raw
material that we find in nature
it's a basic material raw is like a
basic material
it's not been changed it's what you find
in nature
that is needed and used to make
something
so if you talk about you know like a
watch right
the raw material to make the watch is
the metal in the earth
but the it doesn't look like this when
you dig it up it's very small right you
have to
mix it together and then melt it and
you get metal out of that and this is
not raw material this is a finished
product so raw material is the is the
basic
the very basic material that you get out
of the ground
or that grows from the ground that you
get from nature
to make something else okay
and that's our vocabulary for today
interesting words
let's see how they are used
okay we're going to talk about the two
main ideas of this lesson
and the first main idea of course is
producers and consumers
as i said at the beginning of this
lesson we're going to find out
what are producers and consumers
what's the difference between a producer
and
a consumer well a producer as we know
someone
who makes something someone who creates
something to give to another person or
to sell to another person
is a person who provides products or
a person who provides services now like
i said we were going to talk about
services
and this is an important difference we
didn't talk about services in the
vocabulary section
but services is an important word
before i talked about products and i
said a product
is something that you can hold it's
something you can see
you can count one two three four there
are four
products but a service you can't see
a service you can't hold a service where
is a service
right a service is an action
it's something that someone does for
another person
so a service is like an action
that someone does to help
another person think about your school
your teacher doesn't give you a physical
thing
but your teacher does actions
to help you learn and that is a service
right you can't count the the
products that your teacher makes no
there are no products there's nothing
physical there's nothing to touch a
service is just the action it's the
behavior of someone
to help another person so teachers
provide
services doctors provide services
lawyers provide services they help other
people
through their actions and those actions
are
services so producers
produce products and services
they make these things who uses those
things
the people who use the products and
services are called
consumers right consumer of course
means that you use something or you buy
something so if we see in the picture we
can see he buys
products right he's at the marketplace
he's hungry
he's gonna buy some apples so he
buys those products and apple is a
product
now let's take a look at this woman here
in this picture she's
getting her hair done maybe she's dying
her hair
or getting a haircut i'm not sure but
it's not a product
right the barber shop the barber
or the hairdresser is giving her a
service not a product the hairdresser
is acting in a way that helps the woman
so she is buying the service
okay and there's a little note down here
a person can be
both a consumer and a producer
think about this this is interesting
producers
all producers are consumers
but not all consumers are producers
what does that mean that means that
everybody who produces something
they also buy things they also use
things but
all of the people who buy things not all
of them are producers
some people don't produce anything but
usually people produce things maybe not
for sale
but by our actions hopefully we help
each other right
but maybe we don't sell those services
but of course we help each other
so maybe we are producers but anyway
it's an interesting thing
to think about a per but a person you
can be a consumer but you can
also be a producer okay
the next main idea is talking about what
do
producers provide now we already talked
about
products right products are things
things like i said
you can hold them you can touch them you
can see them those are
things they're physical objects
and those are products services they
define it as work now i said before it's
actions but work is an action right it's
something that people
do so services are
actions that you can't really count you
can't really
see you know it's there's nothing to see
after the uh
after the service has been done i mean
if you get your hair cut you can see
that
but it's not really a product right it's
just a change
so services aren't really things you can
see they're just
uh actions that have helped you or help
other people
so what are some examples of products of
things
well do you like lemonade lemonade is a
product
lemonade gatorade all sorts of aids
orange aid
all sorts of drinks soft drinks if you
go to the store
you like iced tea you buy iced tea that
is a
product sandals what do you have on your
feet
maybe you don't have anything on your
feet they're bare feet okay
but when you go outside maybe you put
socks on
right that's a product you might put
sandals on
sandals are a product or you might put
shoes on
shoes are also a product a very famous
product
also what does your family have a car
that your family can drive in
and go on a trip a car is an expensive
product right it costs a lot of money so
some products are cheap cheap or
inexpensive some products are expensive
they cost a lot of money
this car wow it looks very expensive
it's a sports car
that's a very expensive product
on the other side we have services what
are some examples of services
before i told you a teacher teaches you
at school
that is a service but you can also go to
the dentist
don't worry it's not dangerous and the
dentist will help you
i know sometimes it's painful don't
worry
but the dentist gives you a service
right they clean your teeth
they make sure that your teeth are
healthy and that you
have strong teeth and they're so
you go to their dentist they clean your
teeth maybe they
fill any holes in your teeth i hope not
ow
that hurts right so brush your teeth but
anyway
a dental service is what the dentist
does it's an action that helps you
also do you have teachers who come to
your house sometimes
and they teach you different skills you
might have a teacher
who comes to your house and teaches you
how to play the piano
or someone who comes and teaches you
math or or a foreign language
right so those are tutors right a tutor
t-u-t-o-r a tutor is usually someone who
comes to your house
or they don't have to come to your house
you could go to their their place of
business
but they teach you like one on one one
one teacher one student and they help
you improve your skill
at something so a piano lesson a tutor
a piano tutor
help you play the piano oh
well i was going to say more better but
that's don't say more better
someone who plays a piano well and they
teach you how to play
the piano very well okay good so those
are that's the difference between
products things and services work or
actions that help other people okay
interesting ideas
now let's get into the reading
okay let's go over the reading together
and as always you can practice along
with me
or read along in your mind quietly but
focus on the pronunciation
and also pay attention to the vocabulary
and the ideas
we've studied so far are you ready let's
begin
a producer is someone who provides goods
or services a farmer
is a producer things like
fruit and vegetables are products
that are made by a farmer
he sells his products in the marketplace
at the marketplace a person who
owns a business sells the fruit
and vegetables these things
are then sold to your mom
your mom is a consumer
your mom then takes the products home
and uses things like onions and
mushrooms
as the raw materials in a meal
what is she making spaghetti
the farmer is not just a producer
he can buy things like bread or cars
now he is a consumer too
your mom can be a producer too
for example when she teaches students
at a school she is a producer
people can be both producers
and consumers okay great
let's go over the reading organization
the organization of the reading or the
reading skill
is main idea and details
the main idea sometimes is at the
beginning of a reading passage
but sometimes it's also at the end of
the reading passage
in this case the main idea was at the
end of the reading passage
we have a lot of information first a lot
of details
and then we might have a conclusion
right or a
final idea that is the main idea so main
ideas can occur at the
beginning or at the end of a reading
passage
and in this case people can be both
producers and consumers
that's at the end we could have also put
it at the beginning by the way
you could also flip it it doesn't matter
but
the main idea is that people can be both
producers
and consumers so what are the details
that support this main idea first
we have the idea of the farmer right we
had that detail
and we learned about a farmer and we
learned
that a farmer is a or an
in this case though it's a right because
a farmer
is what a farmer does what he grows
things or she grows things
they produce things so they are a
producer
[Music]
producer
producer remember er produce produce
means to make something oh by the way i
should probably also mention
an interesting definition
that is about the same word
produce produce produce means to make
something
but produce is
food produce is food that is grown
fruits vegetables grains that's produce
okay that's a noun and those things that
you eat so that's another interesting
thing about the word producer right
because a producer
you know makes produce right produce is
things that you eat
apples vegetables fruits vegetables
grains all that is produce so
interesting just a little
side note okay so a farmer is a producer
fruit and vegetables are made by a
farmer
well grown by a farmer right he doesn't
make them right he grows them but
you could say he makes them okay good
vegetables at the what where does she go
to buy fruit and vegetables we talked
about this word it's a certain
place what kind of place is it it's a
marketplace
market mar oops that's an a
market
place right it's two words joined as one
it's one word but it used to be two
words they joined together
they got married okay marketplace so
they buy fruit and vegetables at the
marketplace
so if your mom buys things at the
marketplace
what is she a person who buys things
is uh not ann a consumer
consumer consume
because she consumes something she is a
consumer
consumer producer consumer
produce or produce and consume
consumer okay good next detail the last
detail
the farmer can beep bread our cars
now in the reading passage there were
three words in the reading passage
you could just use one word you could
just say buy
but in the reading passage it said buy
you could say just buy the farmer can
buy bread or cars but in the reading
passage it said
the farmer can buy things
right you don't really need things like
i mean you could get rid of it
in the reading passage it was there
though it just says buy what kinds of
things
things like bread or cars examples right
now he is a consumer too so the farmer
even though he produces fruit and
vegetables he can also buy other things
right
so he becomes a consumer as well and
that of course relates back to the main
idea
people can be both producers and
consumers
so right now if you're young you
probably aren't a producer but you are a
consumer right you consume
food your mom makes food you eat it you
are a consumer
you wear clothes you you know your mom
buys the clothes
you wear them you are consuming those
things you're
wearing you're using them uh you're not
you know you can use them for a long
time consume you just usually means one
time you eat something that's gone
but after a while of wearing clothes
they get worn they get old you throw
them away
you consume the clothes when you get
older
of course you will probably be a
producer you'll go have a job
and you'll either make things like
products or you will help other people
with your services so that's an
interesting thing to think about
when you grow up will you be a producer
well i'm gonna say you will be a
producer but will you produce
goods products or will you produce
services
interesting question what do you want to
do okay
well that wraps up our lesson for today
thanks for studying with me
hope it was interesting i'm always
interested by these things as well
too so i hope you're interested as well
take care and we'll see you in the next
lesson
bye bye

hello everybody
00:10
welcome back to american textbook
00:12
reading i'm brian stewart and today
00:14
we're looking at social studies
00:16
book 3 lesson 10 and in lesson 10 we're
00:20
talking about
00:21
producers and consumers
00:25
so in this lesson you will discover the
00:28
difference between
00:30
producers and consumers what are they
00:33
we'll also take a look at what producers
00:37
provide
00:40
okay now we have our vocabulary section
00:43
and our first word
00:44
is producer that's what we're talking
00:47
about right producers
00:48
and consumers so what is a producer
00:52
well a producer is a person who makes
00:56
goods who makes something by the way
00:59
producer is an interesting word because
01:03
you have the word here produce
01:06
produce is a verb
01:10
produce means to make
01:13
something to make something so if you
01:17
make
01:17
something you produce it you are a
01:21
producer
01:21
and now we have the er ending
01:25
er that means a person
01:28
aha so in english it's very interesting
01:32
if you take a verb and you add r or
01:35
er it makes it into a person
01:38
what are some examples for example
01:42
drive drive
01:46
if your father your mother drives a car
01:50
they are a driver
01:53
aha so drive a car a person
01:56
who drives is called a driver
02:00
and many words in english are similar to
02:03
this
02:04
so if you see the er ending you know ah
02:07
it's a
02:08
person probably who does the verb
02:11
right like producer or driver
02:14
not always but most of the time it means
02:18
a person who does something
02:19
in this case a person who makes
02:23
goods all right good next word
02:28
provide provide is a verb
02:31
to provide means to make something
02:34
available to someone to make it
02:37
available it's also like to give
02:40
something if you provide it you give it
02:43
but
02:43
really you make something available to
02:46
someone
02:46
now wait a minute remember what i just
02:48
said about verbs
02:51
do that with this one too if you put an
02:54
r
02:54
here ah that's a person
02:57
provider is a person who gives something
03:01
a provider
03:02
and a producer are very similar
03:05
in meaning a producer makes something a
03:08
provider gives
03:09
something okay interesting let's move on
03:15
product now product now product is a
03:18
noun it's a
03:19
thing a product is something that you
03:21
can hold
03:22
that you can use it's something that is
03:24
grown
03:26
like fruit or meat
03:29
something you can eat or it's
03:32
made for sale in a factory or
03:35
by hand so a product is a thing
03:38
a thing that you can actually touch and
03:40
feel maybe you can eat it
03:42
maybe you can sit in it maybe you can
03:44
drive it but it's a
03:46
thing it's a physical thing that you can
03:49
use
03:49
and it's either grown or made by
03:52
somebody
03:55
next word is a marketplace we just
03:57
talked about
03:58
products usually products are things
04:01
that you
04:01
buy right things that you can use you
04:04
can eat well
04:05
if you want to eat something you might
04:06
go to a market
04:08
place to buy something to eat
04:11
you could also go to a marketplace to
04:14
get clothes
04:15
right to wear those things and clothes
04:17
are a product too
04:18
so a marketplace is a place where people
04:22
buy and sell goods and services we'll
04:26
talk about that in a bit
04:27
but marketplace is actually two words
04:30
that have been combined right so we have
04:34
market and we have place so we have the
04:37
first word is market
04:39
and the second word is place place of
04:41
course is a location
04:43
right it's an area it's a specific place
04:45
you can go to
04:47
your school is a place but we don't call
04:49
it school place we just say school
04:52
but market a market is an area
04:55
where you can buy and sell things and
04:57
this has a very
04:58
old old tradition you know markets have
05:02
existed for
05:02
thousands of years so we just kind of
05:05
combine the two words
05:07
it's a place where you can buy and sell
05:09
things
05:10
it's a marketplace other words that are
05:13
like marketplace
05:14
of course store store means the same
05:18
thing a store or a supermarket
05:22
supermarket usually market was just a
05:26
place where
05:27
farmers sold fruit
05:31
vegetables meat things like that that
05:34
was the old
05:35
definition of a market but markets
05:37
developed they became
05:39
they they used to sell more and more
05:42
goods so now if you go to a market
05:44
or a supermarket you can buy anything
05:47
you buy paper you can buy shoes
05:49
you can buy shirts you can buy an apple
05:51
so it's a supermarket not just a market
05:54
where you buy
05:54
food but a supermarket you can buy
05:56
anything
05:57
at a supermarket so we call it super
06:00
supermarket
06:00
but it's also these are marketplaces
06:03
where you can buy
06:04
and sell goods and services okay
06:09
consumer ah we have another word that
06:12
ends in er
06:14
to consume means to well
06:17
the most common meaning of consume is to
06:20
eat
06:21
or drink but it can also mean to buy
06:24
or to use something so a consumer
06:28
is a person who buys goods or
06:31
services when you go to the store and
06:34
you buy something
06:36
you are a consumer okay
06:42
raw material is our last vocabulary
06:45
items two words raw material
06:49
raw means that it hasn't
06:52
been changed it's in its natural
06:55
state okay it's what you find
06:58
in nature we haven't changed it or we
07:01
haven't
07:02
made it into something else it's the raw
07:05
material that we find in nature
07:07
it's a basic material raw is like a
07:10
basic material
07:11
it's not been changed it's what you find
07:14
in nature
07:14
that is needed and used to make
07:17
something
07:19
so if you talk about you know like a
07:21
watch right
07:22
the raw material to make the watch is
07:24
the metal in the earth
07:26
but the it doesn't look like this when
07:28
you dig it up it's very small right you
07:31
have to
07:32
mix it together and then melt it and
07:35
you get metal out of that and this is
07:37
not raw material this is a finished
07:39
product so raw material is the is the
07:42
basic
07:42
the very basic material that you get out
07:45
of the ground
07:46
or that grows from the ground that you
07:48
get from nature
07:50
to make something else okay
07:53
and that's our vocabulary for today
07:55
interesting words
07:56
let's see how they are used
08:00
okay we're going to talk about the two
08:02
main ideas of this lesson
08:04
and the first main idea of course is
08:06
producers and consumers
08:08
as i said at the beginning of this
08:10
lesson we're going to find out
08:12
what are producers and consumers
08:15
what's the difference between a producer
08:18
and
08:18
a consumer well a producer as we know
08:21
someone
08:22
who makes something someone who creates
08:25
something to give to another person or
08:28
to sell to another person
08:31
is a person who provides products or
08:34
a person who provides services now like
08:38
i said we were going to talk about
08:39
services
08:40
and this is an important difference we
08:42
didn't talk about services in the
08:43
vocabulary section
08:45
but services is an important word
08:49
before i talked about products and i
08:51
said a product
08:52
is something that you can hold it's
08:54
something you can see
08:55
you can count one two three four there
08:57
are four
08:58
products but a service you can't see
09:02
a service you can't hold a service where
09:04
is a service
09:05
right a service is an action
09:09
it's something that someone does for
09:12
another person
09:13
so a service is like an action
09:17
that someone does to help
09:21
another person think about your school
09:24
your teacher doesn't give you a physical
09:27
thing
09:27
but your teacher does actions
09:31
to help you learn and that is a service
09:35
right you can't count the the
09:38
products that your teacher makes no
09:40
there are no products there's nothing
09:42
physical there's nothing to touch a
09:44
service is just the action it's the
09:46
behavior of someone
09:48
to help another person so teachers
09:50
provide
09:51
services doctors provide services
09:55
lawyers provide services they help other
09:58
people
09:59
through their actions and those actions
10:02
are
10:02
services so producers
10:06
produce products and services
10:09
they make these things who uses those
10:12
things
10:13
the people who use the products and
10:15
services are called
10:17
consumers right consumer of course
10:20
means that you use something or you buy
10:24
something so if we see in the picture we
10:26
can see he buys
10:27
products right he's at the marketplace
10:30
he's hungry
10:31
he's gonna buy some apples so he
10:34
buys those products and apple is a
10:36
product
10:38
now let's take a look at this woman here
10:40
in this picture she's
10:41
getting her hair done maybe she's dying
10:44
her hair
10:45
or getting a haircut i'm not sure but
10:48
it's not a product
10:49
right the barber shop the barber
10:52
or the hairdresser is giving her a
10:55
service not a product the hairdresser
10:59
is acting in a way that helps the woman
11:03
so she is buying the service
11:07
okay and there's a little note down here
11:09
a person can be
11:10
both a consumer and a producer
11:14
think about this this is interesting
11:17
producers
11:19
all producers are consumers
11:23
but not all consumers are producers
11:29
what does that mean that means that
11:31
everybody who produces something
11:33
they also buy things they also use
11:35
things but
11:37
all of the people who buy things not all
11:39
of them are producers
11:41
some people don't produce anything but
11:44
usually people produce things maybe not
11:47
for sale
11:48
but by our actions hopefully we help
11:50
each other right
11:51
but maybe we don't sell those services
11:53
but of course we help each other
11:55
so maybe we are producers but anyway
11:57
it's an interesting thing
11:58
to think about a per but a person you
12:01
can be a consumer but you can
12:03
also be a producer okay
12:07
the next main idea is talking about what
12:10
do
12:10
producers provide now we already talked
12:13
about
12:14
products right products are things
12:16
things like i said
12:17
you can hold them you can touch them you
12:19
can see them those are
12:21
things they're physical objects
12:24
and those are products services they
12:26
define it as work now i said before it's
12:29
actions but work is an action right it's
12:33
something that people
12:34
do so services are
12:38
actions that you can't really count you
12:40
can't really
12:41
see you know it's there's nothing to see
12:43
after the uh
12:44
after the service has been done i mean
12:46
if you get your hair cut you can see
12:48
that
12:48
but it's not really a product right it's
12:50
just a change
12:52
so services aren't really things you can
12:54
see they're just
12:55
uh actions that have helped you or help
12:58
other people
12:59
so what are some examples of products of
13:02
things
13:03
well do you like lemonade lemonade is a
13:06
product
13:06
lemonade gatorade all sorts of aids
13:09
orange aid
13:10
all sorts of drinks soft drinks if you
13:13
go to the store
13:14
you like iced tea you buy iced tea that
13:16
is a
13:17
product sandals what do you have on your
13:20
feet
13:20
maybe you don't have anything on your
13:22
feet they're bare feet okay
13:24
but when you go outside maybe you put
13:26
socks on
13:27
right that's a product you might put
13:29
sandals on
13:31
sandals are a product or you might put
13:33
shoes on
13:34
shoes are also a product a very famous
13:37
product
13:38
also what does your family have a car
13:41
that your family can drive in
13:43
and go on a trip a car is an expensive
13:46
product right it costs a lot of money so
13:49
some products are cheap cheap or
13:52
inexpensive some products are expensive
13:56
they cost a lot of money
13:57
this car wow it looks very expensive
14:00
it's a sports car
14:01
that's a very expensive product
14:04
on the other side we have services what
14:06
are some examples of services
14:08
before i told you a teacher teaches you
14:11
at school
14:11
that is a service but you can also go to
14:14
the dentist
14:16
don't worry it's not dangerous and the
14:18
dentist will help you
14:20
i know sometimes it's painful don't
14:22
worry
14:23
but the dentist gives you a service
14:25
right they clean your teeth
14:27
they make sure that your teeth are
14:29
healthy and that you
14:30
have strong teeth and they're so
14:34
you go to their dentist they clean your
14:36
teeth maybe they
14:37
fill any holes in your teeth i hope not
14:40
ow
14:40
that hurts right so brush your teeth but
14:43
anyway
14:44
a dental service is what the dentist
14:46
does it's an action that helps you
14:48
also do you have teachers who come to
14:50
your house sometimes
14:52
and they teach you different skills you
14:54
might have a teacher
14:56
who comes to your house and teaches you
14:58
how to play the piano
14:59
or someone who comes and teaches you
15:01
math or or a foreign language
15:04
right so those are tutors right a tutor
15:10
t-u-t-o-r a tutor is usually someone who
15:13
comes to your house
15:15
or they don't have to come to your house
15:16
you could go to their their place of
15:18
business
15:18
but they teach you like one on one one
15:21
one teacher one student and they help
15:24
you improve your skill
15:26
at something so a piano lesson a tutor
15:29
a piano tutor
15:33
help you play the piano oh
15:37
well i was going to say more better but
15:38
that's don't say more better
15:40
someone who plays a piano well and they
15:43
teach you how to play
15:44
the piano very well okay good so those
15:47
are that's the difference between
15:48
products things and services work or
15:51
actions that help other people okay
15:54
interesting ideas
15:55
now let's get into the reading
15:59
okay let's go over the reading together
16:01
and as always you can practice along
16:03
with me
16:04
or read along in your mind quietly but
16:07
focus on the pronunciation
16:09
and also pay attention to the vocabulary
16:12
and the ideas
16:13
we've studied so far are you ready let's
16:16
begin
16:18
a producer is someone who provides goods
16:22
or services a farmer
16:26
is a producer things like
16:29
fruit and vegetables are products
16:33
that are made by a farmer
16:36
he sells his products in the marketplace
16:41
at the marketplace a person who
16:44
owns a business sells the fruit
16:47
and vegetables these things
16:51
are then sold to your mom
16:55
your mom is a consumer
17:01
your mom then takes the products home
17:05
and uses things like onions and
17:07
mushrooms
17:09
as the raw materials in a meal
17:14
what is she making spaghetti
17:18
the farmer is not just a producer
17:22
he can buy things like bread or cars
17:26
now he is a consumer too
17:32
your mom can be a producer too
17:36
for example when she teaches students
17:39
at a school she is a producer
17:44
people can be both producers
17:48
and consumers okay great
17:52
let's go over the reading organization
17:57
the organization of the reading or the
17:59
reading skill
18:00
is main idea and details
18:03
the main idea sometimes is at the
18:06
beginning of a reading passage
18:08
but sometimes it's also at the end of
18:11
the reading passage
18:12
in this case the main idea was at the
18:15
end of the reading passage
18:17
we have a lot of information first a lot
18:19
of details
18:20
and then we might have a conclusion
18:22
right or a
18:23
final idea that is the main idea so main
18:26
ideas can occur at the
18:28
beginning or at the end of a reading
18:30
passage
18:31
and in this case people can be both
18:33
producers and consumers
18:35
that's at the end we could have also put
18:37
it at the beginning by the way
18:39
you could also flip it it doesn't matter
18:42
but
18:42
the main idea is that people can be both
18:44
producers
18:45
and consumers so what are the details
18:49
that support this main idea first
18:52
we have the idea of the farmer right we
18:55
had that detail
18:56
and we learned about a farmer and we
18:59
learned
18:59
that a farmer is a or an
19:03
in this case though it's a right because
19:06
a farmer
19:07
is what a farmer does what he grows
19:09
things or she grows things
19:11
they produce things so they are a
19:14
producer
19:17
[Music]
19:18
producer
19:20
producer remember er produce produce
19:24
means to make something oh by the way i
19:27
should probably also mention
19:28
an interesting definition
19:32
that is about the same word
19:38
produce produce produce means to make
19:41
something
19:42
but produce is
19:47
food produce is food that is grown
19:50
fruits vegetables grains that's produce
19:54
okay that's a noun and those things that
19:56
you eat so that's another interesting
19:58
thing about the word producer right
20:01
because a producer
20:02
you know makes produce right produce is
20:04
things that you eat
20:05
apples vegetables fruits vegetables
20:08
grains all that is produce so
20:10
interesting just a little
20:11
side note okay so a farmer is a producer
20:15
fruit and vegetables are made by a
20:18
farmer
20:18
well grown by a farmer right he doesn't
20:21
make them right he grows them but
20:23
you could say he makes them okay good
20:30
vegetables at the what where does she go
20:34
to buy fruit and vegetables we talked
20:35
about this word it's a certain
20:37
place what kind of place is it it's a
20:40
marketplace
20:42
market mar oops that's an a
20:46
market
20:49
place right it's two words joined as one
20:52
it's one word but it used to be two
20:54
words they joined together
20:56
they got married okay marketplace so
20:58
they buy fruit and vegetables at the
21:00
marketplace
21:02
so if your mom buys things at the
21:04
marketplace
21:05
what is she a person who buys things
21:09
is uh not ann a consumer
21:13
consumer consume
21:17
because she consumes something she is a
21:20
consumer
21:22
consumer producer consumer
21:25
produce or produce and consume
21:29
consumer okay good next detail the last
21:32
detail
21:33
the farmer can beep bread our cars
21:37
now in the reading passage there were
21:38
three words in the reading passage
21:41
you could just use one word you could
21:43
just say buy
21:45
but in the reading passage it said buy
21:48
you could say just buy the farmer can
21:50
buy bread or cars but in the reading
21:52
passage it said
21:53
the farmer can buy things
21:59
right you don't really need things like
22:02
i mean you could get rid of it
22:03
in the reading passage it was there
22:05
though it just says buy what kinds of
22:07
things
22:07
things like bread or cars examples right
22:12
now he is a consumer too so the farmer
22:16
even though he produces fruit and
22:18
vegetables he can also buy other things
22:20
right
22:21
so he becomes a consumer as well and
22:23
that of course relates back to the main
22:25
idea
22:26
people can be both producers and
22:29
consumers
22:30
so right now if you're young you
22:33
probably aren't a producer but you are a
22:35
consumer right you consume
22:37
food your mom makes food you eat it you
22:39
are a consumer
22:40
you wear clothes you you know your mom
22:43
buys the clothes
22:44
you wear them you are consuming those
22:47
things you're
22:48
wearing you're using them uh you're not
22:51
you know you can use them for a long
22:52
time consume you just usually means one
22:55
time you eat something that's gone
22:57
but after a while of wearing clothes
22:58
they get worn they get old you throw
23:00
them away
23:01
you consume the clothes when you get
23:03
older
23:04
of course you will probably be a
23:06
producer you'll go have a job
23:08
and you'll either make things like
23:09
products or you will help other people
23:12
with your services so that's an
23:14
interesting thing to think about
23:15
when you grow up will you be a producer
23:18
well i'm gonna say you will be a
23:20
producer but will you produce
23:22
goods products or will you produce
23:24
services
23:26
interesting question what do you want to
23:27
do okay
23:29
well that wraps up our lesson for today
23:31
thanks for studying with me
23:32
hope it was interesting i'm always
23:34
interested by these things as well
23:36
too so i hope you're interested as well
23:38
take care and we'll see you in the next
23:40
lesson
23:40
bye bye
