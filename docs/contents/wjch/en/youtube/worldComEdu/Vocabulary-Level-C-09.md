hello everybody
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
i'm brian stewart

interesting
title bravo encore
these are words that we say when we see
a performance a band or somebody does a
really good job
and we clap our hands bravo bravo right
very good job it's like
ciao right and that is the title of this
lesson
so what is this lesson about bravo
encore
what are we talking about well in this
lesson
we will learn about the new york
philharmonic the new york
philharmonic well it's a hymduro word
right that's a difficult word
what is the philharmonic the
philharmonic the new york philharmonic
is a large group of musicians people who
play
instruments all different kinds of
instruments
okay so we'll learn about them we'll
think about different
sounds and what sounds are good and what
sounds are bad
okay so of course for good sounds we say
bravo
encore for bad sounds we say boo
no no good right okay so let's get
started
with the uh with the lesson but before
we do that
to give you an idea of what the
philharmonic is
we can take a look at this video here
this video shows an orchestra that's one
of the words we'll learn in the
vocabulary
orchestra and orchestra as you can see
are many many musicians playing together
there's different sections here we have
violins right over here we have
the chalu right over in the back you
have people playing
trumpets or different kinds of horns
you also have the drummers they're all
in different places
in the orchestra and of course you have
the audience
outside and at the end if the orchestra
is good
they will say bravo bravo encore
right they will show their appreciation
they will say wow that was a good uh
musical performance okay so that's what
we're talking about here
this type of orchestra let's begin with
the words are you ready
let's go okay number one word number one
the person who leads a musical group
in the video maybe it's a little hard to
see but there was one man
standing in front of all of the
musicians and usually he has a stick
right and he waves it like this okay
what do we call that person
he's the leader of the musical group we
call him
the conductor conductor
conductor he is the leader
of an orchestra he leads the musicians
right
so he tells them when to play or you
know how fast to play
and he's always doing this he doesn't
make any music
right he's just telling the other
musicians
how to play okay and he's like the
leader he makes sure they sound good
okay so that's the conductor next we
have
a public performance of music
so before we saw the video there were
many musicians right so many
but look at this picture there's only
one two three and maybe
a number four there's a guy behind there
this would just be a band
not an orchestra but a band an orchestra
sometimes there's just
one person a singer right but it's any
any public performance of music
any time that somebody
plays music for the public and there's
an audience
what do we call that event there's a
special word for that event
we call it a concert concert
a concert is any performance
of music that you go to it can be one
singer
it can be force musicians or it can be
many musicians it doesn't matter when
you go to listen to music
it's called a concert okay next one
of course i've mentioned this already
several times right especially in the
video
i showed those different sections now uh
these
instruments well that's the word right
there it's hard to say it's an
instrument right
it's a device for playing music there
are many
types of instruments
okay instrument or instruments
plural right because here we see a
violin
and of course here we probably this is
part of a tuba
and maybe this is a trombone over here
there's
many kinds of instruments
many kinds of instruments i said like
violin
violin is a type a tuba
right the tuba is the big horn right
that's that goes all around a person and
it's the big
bell out here okay that's the tuba
now you have a violin a guitar is an
instrument
a flute is an instrument there are many
types of
instruments devices for playing music
instrument okay next one
a large group of musicians who play
together don't say philharmonic
philharmonic is the name
of one of these we're looking for
orchestra
orchestra three syllables
or ca stra orchestra
and orchestra the philharmonic the new
york philharmonic
is a type of orchestra
it's the name of that orchestra right
but it's a large group you can see many
people it's a very large group
and in that group you have smaller
groups
each playing different instruments you
may have a group
of people who play the violin a group of
people
who just sing a group of people
well just one person playing the piano a
group of people
playing the flute so an orchestra is a
large group of musicians
in the orchestra sometimes there are
smaller groups of musicians
playing the same instrument and they can
make a really big
and powerful sound and that's special
about an
orchestra okay next one
u.s president barack obama but that's
not the word right
important in history someone who's
important in
history is well something that is
important is historic
the reason they're using this picture is
because he is the first
black president it's not because it's
barack obama
it's because of the historic event
first time that a black person has been
the president of the united states that
is
historic it's important in history
so of course first times are very
important in history wars are important
in history
discoveries are important in history
these are historic people or historic
events or places right
we can use historic as an adjective
to describe many different things so
historic people
historic places historic events
okay next one six to go
into this woman is walking
into what is another word for that
is to enter she's entering
the building to enter the building
when you go to school you enter the
school then you
enter your classroom means to go into
a place next one well these kids
they want to be part of an orchestra
right they're practicing
uh they're all lined up they're playing
looks like a type of flute
uh to entertain people by playing
music so to entertain people by playing
music
what word can we use perform
to perform now look this is a verb
to perform but we can also
change this word to a noun and we can
say
performance okay
if we add a and c and we don't say 2 we
say
a performance
that then becomes
a noun this is a noun because it
is when people get together and they
play music
or they do something uh to entertain
other people we say it's a performance
what are they
doing they are performing
okay so perform is verb performance is
noun okay next one eight
a group of people who watch or listen to
something so this is an interesting word
it's important word let me
make sure i teach you something very
important here because i hear a lot of
konglish okay look at these people here
all of these people all of these people
are are looking at they're listening to
the music played by the orchestra
now these people are not musicians
they are not part of the orchestra
we call them the audience
the audience but this is the important
thing
the audience is all of these people
not one you cannot say
he is an audience no
he is not an audience he is part
of the audience the audience is a big
group
the audience is a big group
so don't say the audiences
clapped no the audience clapped but if
you want to talk about
one person in the audience you have to
say
audience member audience
member if you want to talk about
one person or a few people you can say
audience member
or audience members don't say the
audiences
ah anio it's only one audience it's
one group it's like team right you
wouldn't say
uh the the team kicked the ball
no the team member kicked the ball
okay when we say team we're talking
about a group of people
when we talk about audience we're
talking about the whole group
of people if you want to say one or two
people in that group
you have to say audience member or
audience
members okay please be careful i hear a
lot of mistakes
with that okay next one a thin stick
used to direct a musical group i talked
about
this guy before remember him he is a
conductor
but i said he has a stick that he waves
in front of the audience like you go you
guys play okay you guys right
and he'll use that stick to show the
rhythm
or how people should play the music
right he uses stick
what is the stick called it's called a
baton baton a baton
so the conductor uses
a baton when he conducts
in an orchestra a baton okay next word
a person who performs and writes music
so if this boy can play the guitar
but he can also write the music some
people just play music
somebody else wrote it they read it on a
paper
and they play it but if somebody who
performs
and writes music what do we call them
we call them a musician okay
now of course you they don't just also
have to write music
many musicians also just perform
okay somebody who performs music we can
say a musician
somebody who writes music is a composer
okay so but somebody who performs and
writes together
we can say of course they are a musician
okay
next one a large
number of people so a large number of
people what do we call that
of course we call that a crowd when
there's many many many people
right do you say
or is that right okay that's many many
people together
you can say it's a crowd so if you go to
a baseball game
or a soccer game the people the audience
in the stands that is a crowd of people
many people okay
next one to guide or control
we say to lead to guide or
control something we say is
to lead maybe he is leading his team
so to lead lead is an irregular verb
so it changes form in the past tense
let's see
it goes lead lead lead
so when we talk when we use this verb in
the past
we use lead lead led lead
led led okay next one we're talking
about to make
something happen in a certain way
to make something happen in a certain
way and we can see a calendar here
a calendar with many dates on it and
somebody's marked
the 14th and they did it with a love
sign right somewhere what is that that
looks to me like it's
february 14th right
i don't know but i'm guessing because
february 14th is
valentine's day valentine's day
so i think this calendar is of february
and 14th is marked with a heart because
it's valentine's day
when boyfriends and girlfriends say i
love you
to each other right but anyway so what
are they doing they're making something
happen in a certain way they are saying
that on the 14th we're going to have
valentine's day
we're going to have maybe a party or
we're going to have a date
or we're going to do something special
for that day
what are they doing they are setting
that day or they are setting
a something an event that will happen
in a certain way so to set set
is an irregular verb it doesn't change
form in the past
set set set is the verb
next one a large room for meetings
or concerts so it's a large room
where people can have meetings they can
have concerts
what do we call that room that room is
called
a hall and many times you can see the
word
music hall concert hall
those words usually go together okay
so a hall can be a large room
where a performance or a meeting
is held okay next one wow look at that
many many lights to become full in this
case full of lights
we can say to fill these lights fill
the space if that's the sky stars
fill the sky right so if you
uh or if you there are many people a
crowd of people
will fill the hall they make it
full there's no more room okay
next one to move slowly on water
or in the air look at this balloon it's
a big
balloon or ball filled with air right
it stays on the top of the water if we
put
helium right some gas in this
ball and let it go maybe it will go up
in the air what do we say
it is floating so something can float
on the surface of the water but if
something flies just
in the air you know it doesn't have any
uh control it just kind of floats
in the air like soap bubbles you blow in
all the little bubbles
they float away in the air and clouds
clouds will float in the air some
balloons will float
so to float to move slowly on water or
in the air okay those
are our words lots of words to remember
right
let's see how well you remember what
those words
mean here we have exercise one our
job is to complete each sentence with a
word
from the box so we have sentences here
we'll have eight sentences we have a
blank
in each sentence we need to fill those
blanks
with these words let's review the words
first we have conductor
conductor next instrument
instrument next orchestra
orchestra the next one is
historic historic
next one performed
performed now notice that performed
past tense right because our root is
here
our basic word is here perform but it's
past tense we use
performed okay next one
audience audience
next one is concert
concert and finally we have enter
enter that's easier right okay let's
take a look number one
the pianist remember a pianist is
someone who plays the piano
the pianist's first peep
was held last year so think about this
the pianist what does the pianist do
when a musician
and it doesn't matter if it's one four
people or many people
they entertain an audience
with music what do we call that it's a
noun
right we say it's a concert
right the pianist first concert was held
last year because here we're looking for
it's like a performance concert and
performance are the same
but don't get confused because performed
here is a verb it's not performance
right concert is the word we're looking
for that is a noun
to talk about the performance or the
event
that a musician plays to entertain
people okay number two
the only musical beep i can play
is the piano so the piano is a type of
this
remember when we talked about this word
i said there are
many types of these they're devices
that people play a guitar a
flute a tuba right the big tuba or a
violin
in this case a piano the only musical
what the only musical instrument
the only musical instrument i can play
is
the piano i can ask you can
you play a musical instrument
say no i can't play any musical
instrument or
the only instrument i can play
is the piano or the guitar or the flute
or whatever most people can play a drum
right
maybe not well but you can play the drum
okay next one
number three i wanted to beep
the room but the door was locked well
think about that
you want to do something with the room
you
obviously want to maybe go inside the
room but you can't because the door is
locked if the door is locked
you cannot go into the room go into
what word means to go into
a place what word here ah you're
probably looking for this one right here
right
enter i wanted to enter the room
but the door was locked you can't enter
when the door is locked okay next one
number four
last night she peep a concerto
on the piano a concerto by the way
is a type of performance okay
so uh it's a type of musical
piece that people will play and she did
it on the piano
so when somebody plays music
another word for that verb right and she
did it
last night so it's in the past tense
right
what do we say what verb means to
play some type of performance
right like a concert or a performance if
you do that
you're performing last night she
performed
a concerto on the piano
okay so she performed she performed
a concert or in this case a concerto
a performance on the piano but if you
say she performed a performance
that sounds a little weird it's okay but
perform performance
too similar so we say concert or
something else
okay number five all the people watch
the beep
event on television the what event
what kind of event on television and
all the people watched it so it was very
important
right it was very important what kind of
event can you watch
on television a conductor event that
doesn't make sense
an orchestra event that's weird what
about a historic
event ah all the people watch the
historic event on television
that makes sense that's correct okay so
if it's a historical
event it's very important in history
many people will watch it six he
is the beep of this musical group
so we need one person right
a word that describes a person in a
musical group
remember one type of musical group is an
orchestra
well what is one person in an orchestra
one person an audience
no an audience is a group of people
right
so it's not audience
can it be conductor he is the conductor
of this musical group that's the only
word there that describes one person
of a musical group and remember audience
is not
part it's not part of the musical group
and
also remember audience is a group of
people not one person
we can't say he is the audience that
doesn't make sense
okay unless the audience is only one
person right only one person watching
that would make sense
but of this musical group well actually
that could that could be a possible
but in this case we're looking for
conductor okay next one
seven there was a large beep in the
music
hall there was a large what in the music
hall what are we looking for
we're probably looking for how many
people
came to see the concert so there was a
large
think about a if there was a crowd of
people
many people came to see the concert
and they gathered in the music hall many
people who watch
a musical performance we call them of
course the
audience there was a large audience in
the music
hall so audience is better for this
sentence here
eight a full-size beep is called
a philharmonic so there we have
a little bit of answer as to what
philharmonic means right we're talking
about the new york philharmonic
uh what is it it's an orchestra but it's
a full-size orchestra
that means that an orchestra with all
the different instruments
all the many people uh who play those
different instruments if you have a
certain number
of people playing certain instruments we
call that a philharmonic
so philharmonic is a type of orchestra
okay let's uh stop there of course
that's the end of our exercises
let's take a short break now we'll come
back and we'll look at the reading
and the reading will be about the new
york philharmonic
so take a short break first we'll come
back in just a few seconds

01:25
started
01:26
with the uh with the lesson but before
01:28
we do that
01:29
to give you an idea of what the
01:32
philharmonic is
01:33
we can take a look at this video here
01:37
this video shows an orchestra that's one
01:41
of the words we'll learn in the
01:42
vocabulary
01:44
orchestra and orchestra as you can see
01:47
are many many musicians playing together
01:51
there's different sections here we have
01:54
violins right over here we have
01:58
the chalu right over in the back you
02:00
have people playing
02:02
trumpets or different kinds of horns
02:05
you also have the drummers they're all
02:07
in different places
02:09
in the orchestra and of course you have
02:11

02:13
outside and at the end if the orchestra
02:16

02:20

02:34
the words are you ready
02:36
let's go okay number one word number one
02:40
the person who leads a musical group
02:44
in the video maybe it's a little hard to
02:46
see but there was one man
02:48
standing in front of all of the
02:51
musicians and usually he has a stick
02:55
right and he waves it like this okay
02:57
what do we call that person
02:59
he's the leader of the musical group we
03:03
call him
03:03
the conductor conductor
03:08
conductor he is the leader
03:12
of an orchestra he leads the musicians
03:15
right
03:16
so he tells them when to play or you
03:18
know how fast to play
03:19
and he's always doing this he doesn't
03:21
make any music

03:25
musicians
03:26
how to play okay and he's like the
03:28
leader he makes sure they sound good
03:31

05:43
a large group of musicians who play
05:47

important in
07:02
history is well something that is
07:04
important is historic
07:05
the reason they're using this picture is
07:08
because he is the first

11:18
when we talk about audience we're
11:20
talking about the whole group
11:22
of people if you want to say one or two
11:24
people in that group
11:26
you have to say audience member or
11:28
audience
11:29
members okay please be careful i hear a
11:32
lot of mistakes
11:34
with that okay next one a thin stick
11:38
used to direct a musical group i talked
11:41
about
11:42
this guy before remember him he is a
11:44
conductor
11:45
but i said he has a stick that he waves
11:49
in front of the audience like you go you
11:51
guys play okay you guys right
11:53
and he'll use that stick to show the
11:56
rhythm
11:57
or how people should play the music
11:59
right he uses stick
12:01
what is the stick called it's called a
12:04
baton baton a baton
12:08
so the conductor uses
12:11
a baton when he conducts
12:14
in an orchestra a baton okay next word
12:19
a person who performs and writes music
12:23
so if this boy can play the guitar
12:26
but he can also write the music some
12:29
people just play music
12:30
somebody else wrote it they read it on a
12:33
paper
12:33
and they play it but if somebody who
12:36
performs
12:37
and writes music what do we call them
12:40
we call them a musician okay
12:44
now of course you they don't just also
12:46
have to write music
12:47
many musicians also just perform
12:50
okay somebody who performs music we can
12:54
say a musician
12:55
somebody who writes music is a composer
13:01
okay so but somebody who performs and
13:04
writes together
13:05
we can say of course they are a musician
13:07
okay
13:08
next one a large
13:11
number of people so a large number of
13:14
people what do we call that
13:16
of course we call that a crowd when
13:19
there's many many many people
13:21
right do you say
13:25
or is that right okay that's many many
13:28
people together
13:29
you can say it's a crowd so if you go to
13:31
a baseball game
13:33
or a soccer game the people the audience
13:36
in the stands that is a crowd of people
13:40
many people okay
13:43
next one to guide or control
13:47
we say to lead to guide or
13:50
control something we say is
13:54
to lead maybe he is leading his team
13:58
so to lead lead is an irregular verb
14:02
so it changes form in the past tense
14:05
let's see
14:06
it goes lead lead lead
14:09
so when we talk when we use this verb in
14:12
the past
14:12
we use lead lead led lead
14:16
led led okay next one we're talking
14:19
about to make
14:20
something happen in a certain way
14:23
to make something happen in a certain
14:25
way and we can see a calendar here
14:28
a calendar with many dates on it and
14:31
somebody's marked
14:33
the 14th and they did it with a love
14:36
sign right somewhere what is that that
14:38
looks to me like it's
14:40
february 14th right
14:43
i don't know but i'm guessing because
14:45
february 14th is
14:48
valentine's day valentine's day
14:52
so i think this calendar is of february
14:56
and 14th is marked with a heart because
14:58
it's valentine's day
15:00
when boyfriends and girlfriends say i
15:02
love you
15:03
to each other right but anyway so what
15:05
are they doing they're making something
15:07
happen in a certain way they are saying
15:10
that on the 14th we're going to have
15:12
valentine's day
15:13
we're going to have maybe a party or
15:15
we're going to have a date
15:16
or we're going to do something special
15:19
for that day
15:20
what are they doing they are setting
15:22
that day or they are setting
15:24
a something an event that will happen
15:28
in a certain way so to set set
15:31
is an irregular verb it doesn't change
15:34
form in the past
15:35
set set set is the verb
15:38
next one a large room for meetings
15:42
or concerts so it's a large room
15:45
where people can have meetings they can
15:47
have concerts
15:48
what do we call that room that room is
15:51
called
15:52
a hall and many times you can see the
15:55
word
15:55
music hall concert hall
15:59
those words usually go together okay
16:03
so a hall can be a large room
16:06
where a performance or a meeting
16:10
is held okay next one wow look at that
16:14
many many lights to become full in this
16:17
case full of lights
16:18
we can say to fill these lights fill
16:22
the space if that's the sky stars
16:26
fill the sky right so if you
16:29
uh or if you there are many people a
16:31
crowd of people
16:32
will fill the hall they make it
16:36
full there's no more room okay
16:39
next one to move slowly on water
16:42
or in the air look at this balloon it's
16:45
a big
16:46
balloon or ball filled with air right
16:49
it stays on the top of the water if we
16:52
put
16:53
helium right some gas in this
16:57
ball and let it go maybe it will go up
17:00
in the air what do we say
17:01
it is floating so something can float
17:05
on the surface of the water but if
17:07
something flies just
17:09
in the air you know it doesn't have any
17:11
uh control it just kind of floats
17:13
in the air like soap bubbles you blow in
17:17
all the little bubbles
17:18
they float away in the air and clouds
17:21
clouds will float in the air some
17:23
balloons will float
17:25
so to float to move slowly on water or
17:28
in the air okay those
17:32
are our words lots of words to remember
17:34
right
17:35
let's see how well you remember what
17:38
those words
17:39
mean here we have exercise one our
17:42
job is to complete each sentence with a
17:46
word
17:46
from the box so we have sentences here
17:50
we'll have eight sentences we have a
17:53
blank
17:53
in each sentence we need to fill those
17:56
blanks
17:57
with these words let's review the words
18:01
first we have conductor
18:04
conductor next instrument
18:09
instrument next orchestra
18:14
orchestra the next one is
18:17
historic historic
18:20
next one performed
18:24
performed now notice that performed
18:28
past tense right because our root is
18:30
here
18:31
our basic word is here perform but it's
18:33
past tense we use
18:35
performed okay next one
18:38
audience audience
18:42
next one is concert
18:45
concert and finally we have enter
18:49
enter that's easier right okay let's
18:52
take a look number one
18:54
the pianist remember a pianist is
18:57
someone who plays the piano
18:59
the pianist's first peep
19:02
was held last year so think about this
19:06
the pianist what does the pianist do
19:08
when a musician
19:10
and it doesn't matter if it's one four
19:11
people or many people
19:14
they entertain an audience
19:18
with music what do we call that it's a
19:21
noun
19:21
right we say it's a concert
19:24
right the pianist first concert was held
19:28
last year because here we're looking for
19:31
it's like a performance concert and
19:33
performance are the same
19:35
but don't get confused because performed
19:37
here is a verb it's not performance
19:39
right concert is the word we're looking
19:41
for that is a noun
19:43
to talk about the performance or the
19:46
event
19:47
that a musician plays to entertain
19:49
people okay number two
19:51
the only musical beep i can play
19:55
is the piano so the piano is a type of
19:58
this
19:59
remember when we talked about this word
20:01
i said there are
20:02
many types of these they're devices
20:06
that people play a guitar a
20:09
flute a tuba right the big tuba or a
20:12
violin
20:13
in this case a piano the only musical
20:17
what the only musical instrument
20:20
the only musical instrument i can play
20:23
is
20:24
the piano i can ask you can
20:27
you play a musical instrument
20:31
say no i can't play any musical
20:34
instrument or
20:35
the only instrument i can play
20:38
is the piano or the guitar or the flute
20:42
or whatever most people can play a drum
20:45
right
20:45
maybe not well but you can play the drum
20:48
okay next one
20:49
number three i wanted to beep
20:52
the room but the door was locked well
20:55
think about that
20:56
you want to do something with the room
20:59
you
20:59
obviously want to maybe go inside the
21:02
room but you can't because the door is
21:04
locked if the door is locked
21:06
you cannot go into the room go into
21:10
what word means to go into
21:13
a place what word here ah you're
21:16
probably looking for this one right here
21:17
right
21:18
enter i wanted to enter the room
21:22
but the door was locked you can't enter
21:25
when the door is locked okay next one
21:27
number four
21:29
last night she peep a concerto
21:33
on the piano a concerto by the way
21:36
is a type of performance okay
21:39
so uh it's a type of musical
21:43
piece that people will play and she did
21:45
it on the piano
21:46
so when somebody plays music
21:50
another word for that verb right and she
21:52
did it
21:53
last night so it's in the past tense
21:56
right
21:57
what do we say what verb means to
22:00
play some type of performance
22:04
right like a concert or a performance if
22:07
you do that
22:08
you're performing last night she
22:10
performed
22:11
a concerto on the piano
22:14
okay so she performed she performed
22:18
a concert or in this case a concerto
22:21
a performance on the piano but if you
22:23
say she performed a performance
22:26
that sounds a little weird it's okay but
22:28
perform performance
22:30
too similar so we say concert or
22:32
something else
22:33
okay number five all the people watch
22:37
the beep
22:38
event on television the what event
22:41
what kind of event on television and
22:44
all the people watched it so it was very
22:47
important
22:48
right it was very important what kind of
22:50
event can you watch
22:52
on television a conductor event that
22:54
doesn't make sense
22:55
an orchestra event that's weird what
22:58
about a historic
22:59
event ah all the people watch the
23:02
historic event on television
23:05
that makes sense that's correct okay so
23:08
if it's a historical
23:09
event it's very important in history
23:12
many people will watch it six he
23:15
is the beep of this musical group
23:19
so we need one person right
23:22
a word that describes a person in a
23:25
musical group
23:26
remember one type of musical group is an
23:29
orchestra
23:30
well what is one person in an orchestra
23:33
one person an audience
23:34
no an audience is a group of people
23:37
right
23:38
so it's not audience
23:41
can it be conductor he is the conductor
23:46
of this musical group that's the only
23:48
word there that describes one person
23:50
of a musical group and remember audience
23:53
is not
23:54
part it's not part of the musical group
23:56
and
23:57
also remember audience is a group of
23:59
people not one person
24:00
we can't say he is the audience that
24:02
doesn't make sense
24:04
okay unless the audience is only one
24:05
person right only one person watching
24:08
that would make sense
24:09
but of this musical group well actually
24:11
that could that could be a possible
24:13
but in this case we're looking for
24:15
conductor okay next one
24:17
seven there was a large beep in the
24:20
music
24:21
hall there was a large what in the music
24:24
hall what are we looking for
24:26
we're probably looking for how many
24:28
people
24:29
came to see the concert so there was a
24:33
large
24:33
think about a if there was a crowd of
24:36
people
24:36
many people came to see the concert
24:40
and they gathered in the music hall many
24:42
people who watch
24:44
a musical performance we call them of
24:46
course the
24:47
audience there was a large audience in
24:50
the music
24:51
hall so audience is better for this
24:53
sentence here
24:55
eight a full-size beep is called
24:58
a philharmonic so there we have
25:02
a little bit of answer as to what
25:05
philharmonic means right we're talking
25:07
about the new york philharmonic
25:09
uh what is it it's an orchestra but it's
25:13
a full-size orchestra
25:15
that means that an orchestra with all
25:17
the different instruments
25:19
all the many people uh who play those
25:22
different instruments if you have a
25:23
certain number
25:24
of people playing certain instruments we
25:27
call that a philharmonic
25:28
so philharmonic is a type of orchestra
25:32
okay let's uh stop there of course
25:34
that's the end of our exercises
25:36
let's take a short break now we'll come
25:38
back and we'll look at the reading
25:40
and the reading will be about the new
25:42
york philharmonic
25:43
so take a short break first we'll come
25:45
back in just a few seconds
