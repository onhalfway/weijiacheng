hello everybody
and welcome back to american textbook
reading i'm brian stewart
and in this lesson we're going over
science book 3
lesson 14. and lesson 14 is talking
about
how objects move how their position
moves
so in this lesson we will
discover how to describe first of all
where things are and
how to describe how locations
or positions move okay
so that's our lesson for today
as always we begin with the vocabulary
and the first word we have is position
this is a good place to begin right
because
we talk about where things are where
are objects or people right in this case
we have a boy
so we can say where is he right what is
his position
where is he located position
and location mean the same
thing so position and or location
the place where something is the boy
is on the hill for example
okay that's his position that is his
location
okay next word we have backward
now if you drive a car i know you're
probably too young to drive a car
but if you're on a bike and you move you
know your feet
to make your bike go behind you
you're making it move backward backward
is a word that describes the
direction in which a person or an object
is moving so of course you know you can
move this way we'll talk about that
soon but if you move this way behind you
you're going to go behind you
you're moving backwards towards the
direction
that is behind you okay
and of course if you're driving a car
you have to be very
careful about going backward look right
make sure that you can see where you're
going
okay backward and of course the opposite
direction
is forward so backward forward very easy
usually most of the time we move forward
we
walk forward we ride our bikes forward
your mom or your dad drives the car
most of the time they are going forward
they are going
in the direction that is in in front
sorry
in front of you so in front of you
you're going
in that direction you are moving forward
if you're going in the direction that is
behind you
you are going backward forward backward
okay good leap
can you leap of course you can leap is
like jump
actually leap and jump are very similar
and of course jump is used in the
definition
so jump is right there i won't bother
writing it for you
but leap leap is to make a large jump
it's not just a small
jump oh by the way it's interesting
because
jump there's many kinds of jumps
okay leap is one kind of jump it means
a large jump but what if you take a
short jump
like a bunny rabbit right then we say
that's a
hop hop pandiro
it's the opposite of leap a hop
is a short or small jump a leap
is a big jump you go far on a leap or
you can jump
over in this case this woman is jumping
over
something so she's going to leap she's
not going to hop
she's not going to make it over she's
going to leap over it
but they are both jumps okay so how high
can you
jump okay
roll roll means to move an
object by making it turn over and over
like the up and down making that rotate
so it rolls
in a direction now this is a good
picture because as you can see
it's a picture of bowling and you have a
big
heavy ball we call that a bowling ball
and you throw it down towards the pins
and as the ball moves down the floor it
is rolling
so you want to roll the ball uh it will
turn
it will turn over and over right it will
turn over
and over as it moves in a certain
direction
okay next one is motion
we've talked about several different
types of motion already
in this vocabulary section motion is
just
the process of moving so forwards
that is forward motion backward
that is backward motion rolling you
could say
it has a rolling motion a
jump a leap is also a motion
so motion just means the process of
moving
and we can say we usually use motion as
a noun right which motion
are you using or what is the motion
of the object where is it going is it
going forward is it going backwards
what kind of motion is it jumping is it
rolling so we use motion as a noun
okay those are our words for this lesson
let's talk about the first main idea and
the first main idea is
position words and motion words if you
look at this chart it's divided
into two parts right the top part
the part on top is talking about
where things are maybe at the beginning
or you're just looking at something
you're saying
where is the object the bottom part of
the chart
shows motion so first of all you have an
object
it is in a certain location or position
maybe
it will move and that is the motion so
first
let's talk about where things are what
kind of words can we use
to describe where things are and then
what kind of words can we use
to say how though how the position
or location of those objects can change
okay so first where are things first we
can use the word
on on means that
something a person or an object is
physically touching and it's on top of
another object okay so on
we can say the girl is on
the table that looks like a coffee table
so the girl is on the table and remember
when you say something is on another
thing it's
physically resting right it's physically
resting
on it it's not above it right or
over it it's on it okay
i'll come back to that in the next
picture so on
the girl is on the coffee table now
the girl can also go under the coffee
table like this boy he looks like he's
playing a game
maybe he's hiding from somebody but he
is
under the table so under the table
doesn't have to be touching the table
in this case just under the table the
boy
is under the table
ahead now this might be a little bit
hard to
catch right away but what they're
talking about is here we have two people
we have
we have mom and we have her daughter
and her daughter is sitting ahead of
the mom mom is in the back and the
daughter is
in front or ahead of her
mom usually though we use a head when
we're talking about
many things that are in motion for
example
cars or if you're waiting in line let's
say there's a
very popular movie and you want to buy a
ticket but there's many people waiting
to buy the ticket
so you are in line you can look at the
people
ahead of you in the line and then of
course people behind you
so ahead means in a forward position
closer to an a destination
than another person that's a head and of
course
the opposite of that is behind as i said
before
so something can be ahead of another
thing or it can be behind
another thing and that's a good thing to
think about think of a line you're
waiting in line at a movie theater
or a cafeteria to get your lunch or to
get on the bus to go to school
you're waiting in line who is in front
of you
who is ahead of you and who is behind
you
so ahead we can also use in front
of
and of course behind you can also say
in back of especially we use these
expressions for lines okay good
now that those words tell us where
something
is but what if those positions change
right then we have words that we use to
describe
motion so the first word motion words of
course are used to tell
how something's position changes as we
said before
so forward means forward is the motion
it's the the motion or the direction
in which an object or person
moves so if you are moving forward in
the line
you know maybe it takes a while but
you're moving forward i hope you're not
moving backward
maybe there's an accident up ahead or
something okay so but you're moving
forward
you're going in front of you and of
course backward we already talked about
these words the vocabulary you're moving
backward
you're going in the direction that is
behind you
now two new words up if an
object is moving up it is rising right
it is going
up and if an object is going the other
direction
it is going down so in the this picture
here
the boy and the girl looks like
boyfriend and girlfriend
they are going up the stairs so they go
up the stairs
right maybe there's a cafe up there they
have some coffee
and then later they come down the stairs
okay so
up the stairs down the stairs you can go
up a ladder down a ladder an
airplane goes up and an airplane comes
down
of course safely i hope okay so so
the up and down okay so those words
describe
how objects or people move
now we also have another picture that's
pretty similar actually but we let's
take a look at this and just kind of
maybe review some of these words
and we have a couple more words and
another distinction i want to talk about
like i mentioned before
this is a picture of a bedroom and when
you describe the position
of objects and this is a good example
maybe in a bedroom
we can use certain words now some words
we've already talked about like
on i've already said on on the desk
so if you see this little laptop
computer it is
on the desk don't get that confused with
above or over here we have
above this picture it's a strange
picture
it's a weird yeah because it's the same
as the
as the wallpaper so that's an odd
picture anyway
it the picture is not on the bed it's
not touching the bed it's not
resting on the bed it's on the it's on
the wall because it's touching the wall
okay even though it's not above the wall
it's
on the wall so if you hang a picture on
the wall
it's touching the wall but it's above
the bed because it's in a higher
position
above the bed now we can also say over
over the bed so it's above the bed or
you can say
over the bed above and over are the same
thing
okay on means it's resting it's touching
and there's nothing holding it up right
it's actually resting
gravity is it's it's resting on top of
the object
above means over not touching
another example is this pillow you see
this pillow here
this pillow is it above the bed no it is
on the bed that's a good distinction
moving down we have here to the left
of that's a that's a good phrase to
remember now
of course you have two hands now i'm
looking at you
so my right hand is here and my left
hand is here
right if i turn it around for you guys
right this is my right hand this is also
your right hand
and this is your left hand so when we
talk about things it's very common to
use
right and left in this case we can say
the bed
is to the left of the shelf this is the
shell actually this is kind of a strange
piece of furniture it's a combination
uh these are shelves shelf shelf i can't
see it but shelf shelf
so the whole thing is uh sh
we say shelves uh some people
you could call it a books a bookshelf
right although
he's not using it for books except for
maybe here but anyway
and it's also on the bottom though these
are not shelves these are
cabinets they have dwarves so it's a
combination
cabinet shelf anyway the bed is
to the left of this piece of furniture
so it's to the left of the shelf if
something is on the opposite side it is
to the right to the left to the right
so it's very common for people to say
move
to your left that means you move to your
left or
move to your right move to the right
side
okay so move to the left move to the
right if you're driving a bike
right you want to stay on the right side
of the road uh in most countries
if you're and then people coming towards
you
they are on your left okay good
last one we have next two next two you
could also say
beside next to
means that there's not much distance
between the two objects i mean they
could be touching
that's possible but they don't have to
be touching there could be a small
gap or some space between them but
they're very close to each other
so in this case it looks like a backpack
right i think that's a backpack
and that is next to the closet we can
also say
it is to the left of the closet but it's
pretty close
so it's next to the closet and also we
can say the bed
is next to the shelf but
you see this little piece here it's not
really next to there's something in
in between i'll teach you something new
in between
in between there we go in between this
is actually a
nightstand if you have a little table
sometimes it has a drawer it doesn't
have to it could be just a little table
but if you put it next to your bed you
put your cell phone your alarm clock on
it
we call that a night stand
night stand
because you usually use it at night when
you go to bed
and you put stuff on it it's one word
nightstand so the nightstand is
in between the bed and the
cabinet shelf combination
and the bed is next to the nightstand or
the nightstand is
next to the bed the bed's big so we
would say that the
nightstand is next to the bed okay good
so those are some
extra words or expressions for
describing the positions
of things so now it's time
to go over the reading and as always i
will read the
reading out loud you guys can repeat in
your mind think about the pronunciation
or repeat out loud practice the
pronunciation
actively and of course let's focus on
the vocabulary
that we've learned in this lesson let's
begin
position is the place where an object
is we can describe
an object's position for example
we can say the ball is on the table
if the ball's position is changing
then the ball is in motion
the ball is moving
okay so in motion it is moving
okay next we have objects
can move in different ways
some objects can move fast and
others slow an object can move
in a straight line a ball
can roll in a straight line
a child on a swing moves
forward and backward and
also up and down
up and down and then up right so
it's fun obviously swings are fun
but you're moving in many different
directions
the swing moves in a curved
line now we didn't talk about that in
the vocabulary but that's an important
thing
before we said straight straight
right so things can move in a straight
line this is straight well i'm sorry i'm
i'm not perfect but this is pretty
straight actually let's do this this
line here
is straight but uh oh what did i do
straight
okay straight okay next one
curved curved is not a straight line
in a swing you're going like this that
is a curve
right so you're going in a curved line
and you're going
backwards and forwards forwards and
backwards forwards and backwards
that's a curved line as opposed to a
straight line
so the swing moves in a curved
line if you throw a ball
to a friend the ball will follow
a curved line
if you leap off a table
joshua be careful okay joshua okay
if you leap off a table your motion will
be
up and away from the table and then
down to the ground when you leap you
follow a curved line
okay so very interesting talking about
motion how do things move and we can see
how we move right we can move in many
different ways
balls move in different ways when we
play different kinds of games
we can roll balls we can throw balls and
of course
ourselves we can walk we can run we can
swing
we can jump we can leap lots of
different
motions
okay let's break down the reading
passage into the reading skill
and here we have main idea and details
so kind of what i said it just before at
the end of the reading right
we can move in many different ways and
if
our position is changing if an object's
position is changing
it is in motion that's the main idea
for the reading passage and really this
lesson right
so let's take a look at some details or
examples
that support this sentence or this idea
first we have a person on a swing
moves beep and backward right
so we want the opposite of backward i
know there are many different motions
but here we want the opposite of
backward because
we we mentioned backward so we should
mention the opposite of backward and of
course the opposite of backward
is forward so a person a swing moves
forward forward
and backward forward and backward
also up and down that's true but they
said backwards so we need the opposite
forward and backward the swing follows
now what kind of line are we talking
about
when we describe the motion
of a swing it is is it a straight line
no it is a curved line
it is a curved
line curved curved
it's a little difficult right when you
make the v
your teeth are on your bottom lip and
the duh
curved when you make the dust on your
tongue
goes up to the top the roof of your
mouth just
quickly it touches it and drops so
curved
curved yeah okay if you practice these
positions you will pronounce that
perfectly curved okay good curved
so a curved line okay next one
if you beep over a friend
your motion will be up and forward and
then
down now it didn't exactly say this
in the text that's okay because we can
think about they did talk about
jumping off a table right and what kind
of jump it's a
big jump so we use not hop we use
leap and it should be past tense if you
well it doesn't have to be actually you
can use present tense
if you leap if you leap over a friend
now don't do this because it's a little
dangerous
but if you try to jump over a friend
maybe if your friend
kneels down right and you're on a table
and you jump over your friend you leap
over your friend
don't just try to leap over your friend
if they're standing up
that's not a good idea okay so be
careful
okay but if you leap over a friend think
about it if you jump over a friend
your motion will be up right because
you're jumping up
and of course forward but then you will
come down because of gravity
and you will come back to earth actually
that's good that's a good thing
okay so if you leap over a friend it's
not in the text but we can imagine that
now next if an object is in
motion its beep is changing
well what are we talking about right
actually this
this part is almost saying
this again it's basically repeating the
idea here
and it's just changing the words around
right so it says
if a object's position is changing it is
in motion
so this says if an object is in motion
it's
what is changing well it's right there
its position is changing
position is changing
so this is really not
technically it's not a detail that
supports the main idea
it is a restatement of the main idea
and that also is very common in writing
when you're writing you might start off
with a topic sentence or a main idea
then you have detailed detailed detail
and then you could restate the main idea
but when you restate the main idea
don't just repeat the same way
it shows your writing skill if you can
change it around that's exactly what we
have here
right we say we say the main idea in one
way and then we give detailed detailed
detail
and then we restate the
main idea in a different way and that's
a very common
writing technique okay
well uh that's our lesson for today so
again we covered
uh how to talk about or how to describe
the position of objects and also how
they
move so i hope you learned some
interesting ideas
some good vocabulary as well and thank
you for studying with me
as always we'll see in the next one take
care bye bye
you

hello everybody
00:09
and welcome back to american textbook
00:11
reading i'm brian stewart
00:13
and in this lesson we're going over
00:15
science book 3
00:17
lesson 14. and lesson 14 is talking
00:20
about
00:21
how objects move how their position
00:24
moves
00:25
so in this lesson we will
00:28
discover how to describe first of all
00:32
where things are and
00:35
how to describe how locations
00:38
or positions move okay
00:42
so that's our lesson for today
00:45
as always we begin with the vocabulary
00:48
and the first word we have is position
00:52
this is a good place to begin right
00:54
because
00:55
we talk about where things are where
00:58
are objects or people right in this case
01:01
we have a boy
01:03
so we can say where is he right what is
01:06
his position
01:07
where is he located position
01:10
and location mean the same
01:14
thing so position and or location
01:17
the place where something is the boy
01:21
is on the hill for example
01:24
okay that's his position that is his
01:27
location
01:29
okay next word we have backward
01:32
now if you drive a car i know you're
01:34
probably too young to drive a car
01:37
but if you're on a bike and you move you
01:39
know your feet
01:40
to make your bike go behind you
01:43
you're making it move backward backward
01:47
is a word that describes the
01:50
direction in which a person or an object
01:54
is moving so of course you know you can
01:57
move this way we'll talk about that
01:59
soon but if you move this way behind you
02:02
you're going to go behind you
02:04
you're moving backwards towards the
02:06
direction
02:07
that is behind you okay
02:10
and of course if you're driving a car
02:12
you have to be very
02:13
careful about going backward look right
02:17
make sure that you can see where you're
02:19
going
02:20
okay backward and of course the opposite
02:24
direction
02:25
is forward so backward forward very easy
02:29
usually most of the time we move forward
02:32
we
02:32
walk forward we ride our bikes forward
02:36
your mom or your dad drives the car
02:39
most of the time they are going forward
02:42
they are going
02:43
in the direction that is in in front
02:46
sorry
02:46
in front of you so in front of you
02:49
you're going
02:50
in that direction you are moving forward
02:53
if you're going in the direction that is
02:55
behind you
02:56
you are going backward forward backward
02:59
okay good leap
03:02
can you leap of course you can leap is
03:05
like jump
03:06
actually leap and jump are very similar
03:08
and of course jump is used in the
03:09
definition
03:10
so jump is right there i won't bother
03:13
writing it for you
03:14
but leap leap is to make a large jump
03:16
it's not just a small
03:18
jump oh by the way it's interesting
03:20
because
03:21
jump there's many kinds of jumps
03:24
okay leap is one kind of jump it means
03:28
a large jump but what if you take a
03:30
short jump
03:31
like a bunny rabbit right then we say
03:34
that's a
03:35
hop hop pandiro
03:38
it's the opposite of leap a hop
03:42
is a short or small jump a leap
03:45
is a big jump you go far on a leap or
03:48
you can jump
03:49
over in this case this woman is jumping
03:52
over
03:53
something so she's going to leap she's
03:55
not going to hop
03:56
she's not going to make it over she's
03:58
going to leap over it
03:59
but they are both jumps okay so how high
04:03
can you
04:03
jump okay
04:07
roll roll means to move an
04:10
object by making it turn over and over
04:14
like the up and down making that rotate
04:16
so it rolls
04:18
in a direction now this is a good
04:20
picture because as you can see
04:22
it's a picture of bowling and you have a
04:25
big
04:25
heavy ball we call that a bowling ball
04:28
and you throw it down towards the pins
04:32
and as the ball moves down the floor it
04:34
is rolling
04:35
so you want to roll the ball uh it will
04:39
turn
04:39
it will turn over and over right it will
04:42
turn over
04:43
and over as it moves in a certain
04:47
direction
04:48
okay next one is motion
04:52
we've talked about several different
04:54
types of motion already
04:56
in this vocabulary section motion is
04:59
just
04:59
the process of moving so forwards
05:03
that is forward motion backward
05:06
that is backward motion rolling you
05:10
could say
05:10
it has a rolling motion a
05:14
jump a leap is also a motion
05:17
so motion just means the process of
05:20
moving
05:21
and we can say we usually use motion as
05:24
a noun right which motion
05:27
are you using or what is the motion
05:31
of the object where is it going is it
05:34
going forward is it going backwards
05:37
what kind of motion is it jumping is it
05:40
rolling so we use motion as a noun
05:43
okay those are our words for this lesson
05:48
let's talk about the first main idea and
05:50
the first main idea is
05:52
position words and motion words if you
05:55
look at this chart it's divided
05:57
into two parts right the top part
06:00
the part on top is talking about
06:04
where things are maybe at the beginning
06:07
or you're just looking at something
06:09
you're saying
06:09
where is the object the bottom part of
06:12
the chart
06:13
shows motion so first of all you have an
06:17
object
06:18
it is in a certain location or position
06:20
maybe
06:21
it will move and that is the motion so
06:24
first
06:24
let's talk about where things are what
06:27
kind of words can we use
06:29
to describe where things are and then
06:32
what kind of words can we use
06:34
to say how though how the position
06:37
or location of those objects can change
06:40
okay so first where are things first we
06:43
can use the word
06:45
on on means that
06:48
something a person or an object is
06:51
physically touching and it's on top of
06:55
another object okay so on
06:58
we can say the girl is on
07:02
the table that looks like a coffee table
07:05
so the girl is on the table and remember
07:09
when you say something is on another
07:11
thing it's
07:12
physically resting right it's physically
07:15
resting
07:16
on it it's not above it right or
07:19
over it it's on it okay
07:22
i'll come back to that in the next
07:24
picture so on
07:26
the girl is on the coffee table now
07:29
the girl can also go under the coffee
07:32
table like this boy he looks like he's
07:34
playing a game
07:35
maybe he's hiding from somebody but he
07:38
is
07:38
under the table so under the table
07:41
doesn't have to be touching the table
07:43
in this case just under the table the
07:46
boy
07:46
is under the table
07:49
ahead now this might be a little bit
07:51
hard to
07:52
catch right away but what they're
07:54
talking about is here we have two people
07:56
we have
07:56
we have mom and we have her daughter
08:00
and her daughter is sitting ahead of
08:03
the mom mom is in the back and the
08:06
daughter is
08:07
in front or ahead of her
08:10
mom usually though we use a head when
08:14
we're talking about
08:15
many things that are in motion for
08:18
example
08:18
cars or if you're waiting in line let's
08:21
say there's a
08:22
very popular movie and you want to buy a
08:25
ticket but there's many people waiting
08:27
to buy the ticket
08:28
so you are in line you can look at the
08:31
people
08:31
ahead of you in the line and then of
08:34
course people behind you
08:36
so ahead means in a forward position
08:39
closer to an a destination
08:42
than another person that's a head and of
08:45
course
08:46
the opposite of that is behind as i said
08:49
before
08:49
so something can be ahead of another
08:52
thing or it can be behind
08:54
another thing and that's a good thing to
08:56
think about think of a line you're
08:58
waiting in line at a movie theater
09:00
or a cafeteria to get your lunch or to
09:03
get on the bus to go to school
09:05
you're waiting in line who is in front
09:07
of you
09:08
who is ahead of you and who is behind
09:10
you
09:11
so ahead we can also use in front
09:14
of
09:17
and of course behind you can also say
09:20
in back of especially we use these
09:25
expressions for lines okay good
09:28
now that those words tell us where
09:31
something
09:32
is but what if those positions change
09:36
right then we have words that we use to
09:39
describe
09:40
motion so the first word motion words of
09:42
course are used to tell
09:44
how something's position changes as we
09:46
said before
09:47
so forward means forward is the motion
09:51
it's the the motion or the direction
09:54
in which an object or person
09:57
moves so if you are moving forward in
10:00
the line
10:01
you know maybe it takes a while but
10:02
you're moving forward i hope you're not
10:04
moving backward
10:06
maybe there's an accident up ahead or
10:07
something okay so but you're moving
10:09
forward
10:10
you're going in front of you and of
10:12
course backward we already talked about
10:13
these words the vocabulary you're moving
10:15
backward
10:16
you're going in the direction that is
10:18
behind you
10:19
now two new words up if an
10:22
object is moving up it is rising right
10:26
it is going
10:26
up and if an object is going the other
10:29
direction
10:30
it is going down so in the this picture
10:33
here
10:34
the boy and the girl looks like
10:36
boyfriend and girlfriend
10:37
they are going up the stairs so they go
10:40
up the stairs
10:41
right maybe there's a cafe up there they
10:43
have some coffee
10:44
and then later they come down the stairs
10:46
okay so
10:47
up the stairs down the stairs you can go
10:50
up a ladder down a ladder an
10:54
airplane goes up and an airplane comes
10:57
down
10:58
of course safely i hope okay so so
11:01
the up and down okay so those words
11:04
describe
11:05
how objects or people move
11:10
now we also have another picture that's
11:13
pretty similar actually but we let's
11:15
take a look at this and just kind of
11:16
maybe review some of these words
11:18
and we have a couple more words and
11:21
another distinction i want to talk about
11:23
like i mentioned before
11:24
this is a picture of a bedroom and when
11:27
you describe the position
11:29
of objects and this is a good example
11:32
maybe in a bedroom
11:33
we can use certain words now some words
11:36
we've already talked about like
11:37
on i've already said on on the desk
11:40
so if you see this little laptop
11:42
computer it is
11:44
on the desk don't get that confused with
11:48
above or over here we have
11:51
above this picture it's a strange
11:54
picture
11:56
it's a weird yeah because it's the same
11:59
as the
11:59
as the wallpaper so that's an odd
12:01
picture anyway
12:03
it the picture is not on the bed it's
12:05
not touching the bed it's not
12:06
resting on the bed it's on the it's on
12:09
the wall because it's touching the wall
12:11
okay even though it's not above the wall
12:14
it's
12:14
on the wall so if you hang a picture on
12:17
the wall
12:18
it's touching the wall but it's above
12:20
the bed because it's in a higher
12:22
position
12:23
above the bed now we can also say over
12:27
over the bed so it's above the bed or
12:30
you can say
12:31
over the bed above and over are the same
12:34
thing
12:34
okay on means it's resting it's touching
12:38
and there's nothing holding it up right
12:40
it's actually resting
12:42
gravity is it's it's resting on top of
12:45
the object
12:46
above means over not touching
12:49
another example is this pillow you see
12:52
this pillow here
12:53
this pillow is it above the bed no it is
12:56
on the bed that's a good distinction
12:59
moving down we have here to the left
13:02
of that's a that's a good phrase to
13:05
remember now
13:06
of course you have two hands now i'm
13:08
looking at you
13:10
so my right hand is here and my left
13:12
hand is here
13:13
right if i turn it around for you guys
13:15
right this is my right hand this is also
13:17
your right hand
13:18
and this is your left hand so when we
13:20
talk about things it's very common to
13:22
use
13:23
right and left in this case we can say
13:27
the bed
13:28
is to the left of the shelf this is the
13:31
shell actually this is kind of a strange
13:32
piece of furniture it's a combination
13:35
uh these are shelves shelf shelf i can't
13:38
see it but shelf shelf
13:40
so the whole thing is uh sh
13:43
we say shelves uh some people
13:47
you could call it a books a bookshelf
13:49
right although
13:50
he's not using it for books except for
13:52
maybe here but anyway
13:53
and it's also on the bottom though these
13:55
are not shelves these are
13:57
cabinets they have dwarves so it's a
13:59
combination
14:01
cabinet shelf anyway the bed is
14:05
to the left of this piece of furniture
14:08
so it's to the left of the shelf if
14:10
something is on the opposite side it is
14:12
to the right to the left to the right
14:16
so it's very common for people to say
14:19
move
14:19
to your left that means you move to your
14:22
left or
14:23
move to your right move to the right
14:26
side
14:26
okay so move to the left move to the
14:29
right if you're driving a bike
14:31
right you want to stay on the right side
14:34
of the road uh in most countries
14:37
if you're and then people coming towards
14:40
you
14:41
they are on your left okay good
14:45
last one we have next two next two you
14:47
could also say
14:48
beside next to
14:52
means that there's not much distance
14:54
between the two objects i mean they
14:56
could be touching
14:57
that's possible but they don't have to
14:59
be touching there could be a small
15:01
gap or some space between them but
15:03
they're very close to each other
15:05
so in this case it looks like a backpack
15:07
right i think that's a backpack
15:10
and that is next to the closet we can
15:12
also say
15:13
it is to the left of the closet but it's
15:16
pretty close
15:17
so it's next to the closet and also we
15:20
can say the bed
15:21
is next to the shelf but
15:26
you see this little piece here it's not
15:28
really next to there's something in
15:29
in between i'll teach you something new
15:32
in between
15:37
in between there we go in between this
15:40
is actually a
15:41
nightstand if you have a little table
15:44
sometimes it has a drawer it doesn't
15:46
have to it could be just a little table
15:47
but if you put it next to your bed you
15:50
put your cell phone your alarm clock on
15:52
it
15:52
we call that a night stand
15:55
night stand
15:58
because you usually use it at night when
16:01
you go to bed
16:02
and you put stuff on it it's one word
16:04
nightstand so the nightstand is
16:06
in between the bed and the
16:09
cabinet shelf combination
16:13
and the bed is next to the nightstand or
16:15
the nightstand is
16:16
next to the bed the bed's big so we
16:19
would say that the
16:20
nightstand is next to the bed okay good
16:22
so those are some
16:23
extra words or expressions for
16:26
describing the positions
16:28
of things so now it's time
16:32
to go over the reading and as always i
16:34
will read the
16:36
reading out loud you guys can repeat in
16:38
your mind think about the pronunciation
16:40
or repeat out loud practice the
16:42
pronunciation
16:43
actively and of course let's focus on
16:45
the vocabulary
16:46
that we've learned in this lesson let's
16:49
begin
16:52
position is the place where an object
16:55
is we can describe
16:59
an object's position for example
17:03
we can say the ball is on the table
17:07
if the ball's position is changing
17:11
then the ball is in motion
17:15
the ball is moving
17:18
okay so in motion it is moving
17:24
okay next we have objects
17:27
can move in different ways
17:30
some objects can move fast and
17:34
others slow an object can move
17:38
in a straight line a ball
17:41
can roll in a straight line
17:47
a child on a swing moves
17:50
forward and backward and
17:53
also up and down
17:57
up and down and then up right so
18:00
it's fun obviously swings are fun
18:03
but you're moving in many different
18:05
directions
18:08
the swing moves in a curved
18:12
line now we didn't talk about that in
18:14
the vocabulary but that's an important
18:16
thing
18:16
before we said straight straight
18:19
right so things can move in a straight
18:21
line this is straight well i'm sorry i'm
18:24
i'm not perfect but this is pretty
18:28
straight actually let's do this this
18:30
line here
18:31
is straight but uh oh what did i do
18:33
straight
18:34
okay straight okay next one
18:38
curved curved is not a straight line
18:42
in a swing you're going like this that
18:45
is a curve
18:46
right so you're going in a curved line
18:49
and you're going
18:50
backwards and forwards forwards and
18:53
backwards forwards and backwards
18:55
that's a curved line as opposed to a
18:58
straight line
18:59
so the swing moves in a curved
19:02
line if you throw a ball
19:06
to a friend the ball will follow
19:09
a curved line
19:14
if you leap off a table
19:17
joshua be careful okay joshua okay
19:21
if you leap off a table your motion will
19:24
be
19:24
up and away from the table and then
19:28
down to the ground when you leap you
19:31
follow a curved line
19:34
okay so very interesting talking about
19:38
motion how do things move and we can see
19:41
how we move right we can move in many
19:44
different ways
19:45
balls move in different ways when we
19:48
play different kinds of games
19:49
we can roll balls we can throw balls and
19:52
of course
19:53
ourselves we can walk we can run we can
19:56
swing
19:56
we can jump we can leap lots of
19:59
different
20:00
motions
20:04
okay let's break down the reading
20:05
passage into the reading skill
20:07
and here we have main idea and details
20:10
so kind of what i said it just before at
20:12
the end of the reading right
20:14
we can move in many different ways and
20:17
if
20:17
our position is changing if an object's
20:21
position is changing
20:22
it is in motion that's the main idea
20:26
for the reading passage and really this
20:28
lesson right
20:29
so let's take a look at some details or
20:32
examples
20:33
that support this sentence or this idea
20:37
first we have a person on a swing
20:41
moves beep and backward right
20:45
so we want the opposite of backward i
20:48
know there are many different motions
20:50
but here we want the opposite of
20:52
backward because
20:54
we we mentioned backward so we should
20:56
mention the opposite of backward and of
20:58
course the opposite of backward
21:00
is forward so a person a swing moves
21:04
forward forward
21:08
and backward forward and backward
21:12
also up and down that's true but they
21:14
said backwards so we need the opposite
21:16
forward and backward the swing follows
21:20
now what kind of line are we talking
21:23
about
21:23
when we describe the motion
21:26
of a swing it is is it a straight line
21:30
no it is a curved line
21:33
it is a curved
21:36
line curved curved
21:40
it's a little difficult right when you
21:42
make the v
21:44
your teeth are on your bottom lip and
21:46
the duh
21:47
curved when you make the dust on your
21:50
tongue
21:51
goes up to the top the roof of your
21:53
mouth just
21:54
quickly it touches it and drops so
21:57
curved
21:58
curved yeah okay if you practice these
22:01
positions you will pronounce that
22:03
perfectly curved okay good curved
22:07
so a curved line okay next one
22:10
if you beep over a friend
22:13
your motion will be up and forward and
22:16
then
22:17
down now it didn't exactly say this
22:20
in the text that's okay because we can
22:22
think about they did talk about
22:24
jumping off a table right and what kind
22:27
of jump it's a
22:28
big jump so we use not hop we use
22:32
leap and it should be past tense if you
22:36
well it doesn't have to be actually you
22:37
can use present tense
22:39
if you leap if you leap over a friend
22:42
now don't do this because it's a little
22:44
dangerous
22:45
but if you try to jump over a friend
22:48
maybe if your friend
22:49
kneels down right and you're on a table
22:52
and you jump over your friend you leap
22:54
over your friend
22:55
don't just try to leap over your friend
22:58
if they're standing up
22:59
that's not a good idea okay so be
23:02
careful
23:03
okay but if you leap over a friend think
23:05
about it if you jump over a friend
23:08
your motion will be up right because
23:10
you're jumping up
23:11
and of course forward but then you will
23:13
come down because of gravity
23:15
and you will come back to earth actually
23:18
that's good that's a good thing
23:19
okay so if you leap over a friend it's
23:22
not in the text but we can imagine that
23:25
now next if an object is in
23:28
motion its beep is changing
23:32
well what are we talking about right
23:33
actually this
23:35
this part is almost saying
23:38
this again it's basically repeating the
23:41
idea here
23:42
and it's just changing the words around
23:44
right so it says
23:45
if a object's position is changing it is
23:48
in motion
23:49
so this says if an object is in motion
23:51
it's
23:53
what is changing well it's right there
23:54
its position is changing
23:57
position is changing
24:00
so this is really not
24:04
technically it's not a detail that
24:06
supports the main idea
24:08
it is a restatement of the main idea
24:11
and that also is very common in writing
24:13
when you're writing you might start off
24:15
with a topic sentence or a main idea
24:17
then you have detailed detailed detail
24:19
and then you could restate the main idea
24:22
but when you restate the main idea
24:24
don't just repeat the same way
24:27
it shows your writing skill if you can
24:30
change it around that's exactly what we
24:31
have here
24:32
right we say we say the main idea in one
24:35
way and then we give detailed detailed
24:36
detail
24:37
and then we restate the
24:40
main idea in a different way and that's
24:42
a very common
24:43
writing technique okay
24:47
well uh that's our lesson for today so
24:49
again we covered
24:51
uh how to talk about or how to describe
24:54
the position of objects and also how
24:57
they
24:57
move so i hope you learned some
25:00
interesting ideas
25:01
some good vocabulary as well and thank
25:03
you for studying with me
25:04
as always we'll see in the next one take
25:07
care bye bye
25:14
you
