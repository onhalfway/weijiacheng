hey kids how are you doing it's nice to
see you again my name is brian stewart
and we are here to study from
reading for vocabulary we're starting in
level d on unit one and our subject is
architecture that's a little bit of a
difficult word isn't it
architecture architecture
our lesson one the title is a dream job
so when we think about that what we're
going to focus on is what do you want to
do
in the future have you thought about
that
let's think about the job
architect
architect okay so that's what we're
going to study in this lesson let's
begin
of course there are many different jobs
look at all these jobs can you find the
different names of the jobs we don't
have time to go over all of them but we
can just quickly we can see there's a
doctor all right maybe there's a lawyer
over here there's an electrician over
here there are many different kinds of
jobs when you think about your future
what kind of job do you want well we're
going to talk about one
exciting job in this lesson okay
but let's talk about a few vocabulary
words first as you can see here a quick
basic drawing
can you draw something like this are you
a talented artist if you can draw like
this you can make a sketch this is a
sketch it's a quick basic drawing now
this doesn't look too basic this looks a
little complicated but a quick drawing
of something like your house
a building your school that's a sketch
okay let's move on
this next word is to decide how
something will look or work when people
sit down and they start to think about
how to draw something what are they
doing right we can say that that is
design
design we can use it as a verb or as a
noun what is the design of the building
or he is going to design the building so
we can use it as a verb or a noun
a plan for making something so
this looks very complicated this is not
a sketch this is a very detailed drawing
but it's a plan for making something we
call a blue print why is it blue because
the paper that they draw on has a blue
color and it's very technical it's very
detailed drawings of something we say
it's a blue print a blueprint very
technical or detailed drawing of a
building
okay next one
do you have a knife like that it's a
swiss army knife right
what something is used for what is
something used for we can say what is
its function if we look at this knife
there are many different parts right
this has a different function from this
this this knife its function is just to
cut
this
pliers its function is to hold something
very tightly right so many things have
different functions what is the function
of this tool
okay let's move on
oh warning you shouldn't smoke of course
you don't now don't smoke in the future
right a rule or law no smoking we see
signs like this
many different places right no smoking
jucha kumji right no parking right so
we can say that's a regulation so we can
call a rule a law or regulation that's a
hindura word right
regulation
regulation okay let's move on
someone who works with the law okay as
you know we were talking about jobs
before i pointed out somebody right that
was a lawyer right he was on the side
over there a lawyer is someone who
argues
for or against
a position in a court of law so they are
called a lawyer there's somebody who
argues for something there's someone who
argues against something there's two
lawyers usually in a courtroom at least
two
okay next one
what kind of crazy guy is that he's got
four arms okay
the state of being focused and working
hard he doesn't really have four arms
he's just really busy it looks like he
has forums he's a monster right okay
next uh this this word is dedication if
somebody is so focused on their work
they have a lot of focus and sometimes
when you do your homework you're like
this right you're very focused on your
homework you want to do a good job
you have a lot of dedication
okay that's like you'll shim but also
energy and hard work it's dedication
okay next one
something that could happen okay
something that could happen this is a
little bit of a dangerous position right
possibility it's possible that she could
fall off this is not a good idea
okay so it's pos it's a possibility
something that could happen but also
she's reading about maybe she's reading
about interesting stories and she's
saying thinking
is it possible that this could happen
maybe there's a night that she's
thinking about oh there's a knight in
shining armor it's possible that one day
i could meet that person right so it's a
possibility what's possible in the
future
the next word
have you been to one of these do you
like baseball do you like soccer
if you go to a sports game you will go
to a large open building where people
watch sports i hope you have the
opportunity to go to a place like this
what is this what kind of building is it
it's called a sports
stadium so we use two words sports
stadium okay so if you go there you can
watch your favorite baseball team or
your favorite soccer team okay
wow this looks like it's in australia
right the road is very straight
and doesn't curve and it's very long we
can see really far
having no end if something has no end
there's no end we say it's end less
because this uh yeah i'll do that right
there this
part of the word when you see that less
it means it doesn't have one and
less there's no end okay endless
the next one a sudden dangerous
situation okay of course this is an
ambulance looks like somebody is hurt
what do we call that situation we say
it's an emergency
it is an emergency emergency
we can also use emergency as an
adjective it's an emergency vehicle it's
an emergency worker
this is emergency services so emergency
can be a noun it is an emergency or it
can be an adjective
it is emergency services okay let's move
on
to do the same as of course this is mama
duck and she has her baby ducks behind
her what do baby ducks all birds right
really do this
when mama duck is walking along all the
little birds what do they do they
follow mama duck right to follow if you
do the same thing as somebody else you
are following them to follow okay next
one maybe okay put together in a smart
and simple way
so this person is putting together kind
of a complicated diagram but
he's thinking about how he puts it
together so he's thinking about it in a
smart way and he's trying to make it
simple so what can we call that we say
that's organized organized as an
adjective these plans are very organized
right we can also call people organized
maybe you know somebody in school who is
organized they have all their books in
the right place all their pens in the
other place they're very neat they're
very organized okay next
someone who designs buildings and
machines so this is a type of job this
person is designing maybe a building or
a machine what do we call that person we
say that that person is an
engineer engineer so that person is an
engineer
next one is working hard and completing
a lot of work if you work really hard
and you get a lot of work done what can
we say we can say you you are productive
productive you're productive are you
productive
at night do you do all your homework
really quickly or do you play games
okay if you play games you are not
productive but if you study hard and you
get your work done then you are
productive okay
next one is sad and having no energy
this person is happy she has a lot of
energy but these people are not
they're sad what's going on they are
depressed right they're sad about
something if something happens and it
makes you sad or it makes you
feel not very good we can say that you
are depressed i hope that you don't get
depressed if you do get depressed just
think about the happy side just think
tomorrow is a new day something good
will happen so hopefully we we aren't
depressed very long okay
now let's begin with the exercises okay
how well do you remember the words we
just learned let's go over them
um in this exercise we need to choose
the word that best completes the
sentence our word choices are here and
we need to fill the blank with these
word choices so what is the sentence the
sentence in this case number one
do you think you could beep
our poster for art class
so what we're thinking about here is
you're going to be able to do something
can you
can you beep our poster for our class we
need a verb all of some of these are
verbs but some of them are nouns but we
need a verb here because we want to do
something to our poster for art class
what will you do
if you are a creative person maybe
somebody wants you to
create or make an art poster a poster
for art class so which word is similar
to make or create
a listen
that doesn't make sense you want to
listen to poster that doesn't make sense
b
function
function's a noun it doesn't doesn't
make sense here
design ah design has the same meaning as
make or create that's our answer right
blueprint as i said before that's a noun
right so you don't blueprint a poster
you design a poster so that's the answer
do you think you could design our poster
for art class okay that's the answer
there how about number two
the question is or the sentence is i
looked at your beep
of the whale
it's really good for a new artist
so somebody
did something right they made something
that shows a whale
if you draw something or you make
something a picture right
of an object we can we can say that that
is a picture or a
drawing or what is similar to drawing
here we have a blueprint you make a
blueprint of a whale no because
blueprint is for buildings right you
don't make a blueprint of an animal
that's kind of weird you make a
blueprint of a building if you're an
architect or
somebody who designs buildings
b
sketch ah we talked about this before a
sketch is a basic drawing so if you very
quickly draw a picture of a whale that
is a sketch and that's the answer b
what are the other ones c site site is
just a location right a site is like a
place that doesn't fit here a place of
the whale that doesn't make sense
i looked at your emergency of the whale
that doesn't make sense at all right so
the only one that makes sense is sketch
i looked at your sketch of the whale
it's really good for a new artist that's
our answer there let's move on to number
three
the question for number three is the
beep of the skull is to protect the
brain
remember when we talked about that swiss
army knife that had many different tools
and we talked about what is the use of
each of those tools everything has a use
or what let's take a look here a
blueprint
the skull of course is the bone in your
head right it's the hard bone what does
it do right do we talk about the
blueprint of the skull is to protect the
brain that doesn't make sense
do we talk about the location of the
skull that doesn't make sense either do
we talk about the sketch of the skull
we're not talking about a drawing of
somebody's head we're talking about the
use or the function
what is its use you have a skull it's a
hard bone in your head you can feel it
right now if you want to with me right
it's pretty hard what does it do it
protects your brain your brain is inside
your skull it needs protection so the
skull's function
is to protect the brain so the function
of the skull is to protect the brain
that's the function
okay number four
your son broke the law
no
that's terrible okay
you need a beep okay so if somebody
breaks the law right that person goes to
court and what do we find in court
remember there's two people one four and
one against right what type of person do
you need to help your son do you need an
engineer
no an engineer
makes buildings and machines right so
that's not appropriate we need a lawyer
ah remember we talked about lawyer
lawyers are the people in court one four
and one against one is for the client
one is against the client or the person
who broke the law so we need a lawyer if
i hope not but if our son breaks the law
then we need a lawyer
c is artist and d is architect right an
artist just draws pictures we don't need
them they can't help us and architect
designs buildings so they can't help us
we need a lawyer okay
so that's the answer there your son
broke the law you need a lawyer
okay let's continue from number five
there are many people
to follow when you drive a car now of
course you don't drive a car but if your
mom or dad is driving a car and you're
riding remember look at the signs on the
side of the road it says speed limit
don't go too fast it says you can't turn
this way
those are rules or laws of the road what
is another word that means rule or law
let's take a look well a is regulations
that's our answer there regulations so
the answer is there are many regulations
to follow when you drive a car not
sketches not emergencies and sports
stadiums that doesn't make any sense the
best answer is regulations there are
many regulations to follow when you
drive a car
six
if jim had more beep he would do better
in school what does jim need to do
better in school what do you need to do
better in school does jim need more
anger no
don't be angry jim don't take that to
school right get rid of it
does he need depression no i hope jim is
not depressed right if he's sad he won't
do well in school
does jim need more anxiety anxiety means
worry
now he maybe jim if jim worried more he
would do better in school that's
possible but a better answer is
dedication right so the better answer is
dedication dedication means
enthusiasm you shim right he needs
energy he needs dedication he needs to
focus on his work if he had more
dedication he would do better in school
i hope you have dedication too right
okay let's move on to its dedication of
course if jim had more dedication he
would do better in school let's move on
to number seven
there is a beep that it will rain
tomorrow so when we're talking about
tomorrow there are many things that
could happen tomorrow
rain is one of those things that it
could happen so when we talk about
things that could happen we are talking
about what are we talking about a site
no remember site is a location a place
so it's not sight is it possibility yes
possibility means something could happen
there is a possibility it is possible i
just use that word in a different way
you can do that it
is
possible
okay so this word you can use it in
different ways we say there is a
possibility that's noun it is possible
that's adjective right so we use it in
different ways and these are very common
ways to use that word
okay so there is a possibility that it
will rain tomorrow okay number eight
the beep for the new school is almost
finished i'll send it to you when i'm
done this second sentence is important
why because we're talking about
something for the new school before a
school is built you have to draw the
design of that school what are we
looking at we're looking at the function
for the new school that doesn't make
sense the site that could be
the site for the new school is almost
finished the location right maybe they
they pave the the the ground but the
next sentence i'll send it to you
how are you going to send a huge piece
of ground to somebody that doesn't make
sense
next word is blueprint the blueprint ah
the drawings you can send drawings
that's no problem so blueprint is right
the blueprint the design the plans
for the new school
the blueprint is almost finished i'll
send it to you no problem not the sports
stadium again you can't send a sports
stadium in the mail they won't take it
okay but the best answer of course is
blueprint the blueprint for the new
school is almost finished i'll send it
to you
when i'm done okay well that wraps up
the vocabulary section of this unit
let's take a short break we'll come back
and look at the reading
[Music]
[Music]
hello everyone welcome back to reading
for vocabulary i'm brian stewart it's
good to see you again
we're on lesson two in level d of
reading for vocabulary do you remember
in lesson one we talked about a cool job
that's being an architect well in lesson
two let's take a look at some amazing
architecture
we're going to learn about famous
architecture in the world we can think
of famous buildings or structures that
were built
in history and that we remember do you
know some of them let's go through some
of the like wonders of the world famous
buildings and structures for example do
you know this one you probably do if
you've ever read about egypt especially
ancient egypt you will know what these
structures are there's actually two the
first one here is the great pyramid of
giza the great pyramid of giza giza is a
place
in egypt where there are many pyramids
and these of course are tombs where the
dead kings or pharaohs of the egyptians
were put into these pyramids and of
course the other famous structure is the
sphinx the sphinx which is also very
famous okay
the next one is do you know this one of
course it's the eiffel tower
eiffel tower in paris
france whenever people think about
france or think of pictures of france
and especially paris we usually think of
the eiffel tower it's a landmark
a land
mark
most of these buildings the pyramids the
sphinx the eiffel tower these are
landmarks in seoul what is a famous
landmark of course namsan tower or now
they call it seoul tower right so that
is a famous landmark you see it you say
oh i know where i am and i know that
this is famous for being in this city so
the eiffel tower is a famous landmark in
paris
also very famous landmark in china many
people think about it is the great wall
built a long long time ago hundreds of
years ago to keep the barbarians of the
north out of china the great wall of
china one of the biggest most impressive
uh arc pieces of architecture in the
world you can see it from space
wow okay
the next one the south focade the south
kade of the white house so in other
words if you look at the white house if
you think of washington d.c the u.s
government especially the president
then we
instantly recognize this image because
of the building this it's a unique style
of building and this of course is the
south side
fakad or facade i'm sorry facade is the
south side of a building and that's the
front entrance basically okay
next
machu picchu have you heard of machu
picchu that name sounds kind of funny
right that same sounds kind of cool
this is a very mysterious city it's not
just one building it was a whole city
built out of stone all the people
disappeared hundreds of years ago we're
still
archaeologists scientists are still
trying to figure out
who were they why did they leave what
happened we still don't know it's very
mysterious and of course this is in
south america it's machu picchu on the
top of a high mountain
okay
the last one here is the taj mahal in
india maybe you've heard of this this is
very famous symbol for love because a
prince built this huge building because
of his love for his
his lover the woman that he loved
so he built this very beautiful building
and it still stands today and it's a
very big tourist attraction and it's a
symbol
of love the taj mahal in india
okay those are some examples of famous
architecture in the world many of them
are famous i'm sure you've probably
heard of them before but let's take a
look now at uh
the vocabulary we're going to need in
order to read the passage the first word
that we're going to talk about here is
defined as a structure a structure some
type of building could be small could be
big a structure we put dead people in
sounds kind of funny we put dead people
in it but of course when somebody dies
you know there's the question of what to
do with the person's body after they've
died right
in some cases they put them under the
ground they bury them underground that
would be a grave
some people they don't want their body
to be put in the ground they would want
to be burned right by fire and that's
cremate to cremate
this is a great subject huh very
exciting subject but anyway graves
cremate but this is another way another
type of
putting the dead body and this is called
a tomb a tomb is usually above ground
it's a small building like this it might
have a door or it might not have a door
but sometimes it has a door you go in
and there are spaces for the different
uh bodies usually a family like an
important or rich family will have a
tomb and they put their the coffins the
bodies in different spaces on the wall
and the relatives or the descendants can
go and visit the ancestors okay that's a
tomb
okay
next word is something we store things
in of course you probably have many of
these your mom has many of these in the
refrigerator she keeps food in them you
store something in them they're called
containers and nowadays many containers
are made of plastic of course containers
can be made of metal of wood of all
sorts of different materials but most
containers today are made of plastic and
we store we keep things in those
containers
the next word is to pull over the ground
now they're just playing but sometimes
if you see a mom the little boy or girl
they don't want to go and mom's like
pulling them along the ground what's
going on she's dragging
the kid on the ground right
so it's kind of funny
to pull over the ground of course
they're just playing
pipes that carry water and other liquids
so in a house there are many pipes that
carry hot water they carry cold water in
a factory uh pipes will carry lots of
different types of liquids what do we
call those we call that system of pipes
plumbing so really it's not just the
pipes it's the system of pipes if you
think about your house
okay if you think about your house you
have a kitchen sink right you have a
toilet those are all different pipes
for water coming in and water coming out
if there's a problem you say we have a
problem with the plumbing
you need to call somebody over a plumber
to fix it
okay next one whoa this guy's rich
right he's like uh he's uh he's like mr
scrooge but he has a lot of money
having a lot of money don't call him
scrooge we can say he's rich right
scrooge is a specific meaning it means
somebody who doesn't like to spend money
but not all rich people are scrooges
some rich people like to spend their
money right but just if you have a lot
of money you are rich okay but we can be
rich in other things too you can be rich
in love you can be rich in knowledge
right so you can be rich in a lot of
different things
okay next one to make someone or
something do what you want this is a
it's like a puppet a
puppet
master
okay a puppet is a little doll that you
can control by strings these would be
the puppets and he's the puppet master
but this word that we're looking for the
puppet master controls the puppets he
controls if you make somebody or
something do what you want you are
controlling a person or a thing okay so
that's to control
now something made of many parts of
course a building is made of many
different parts many machines are made
of different parts look at your computer
it has many different parts inside of it
it is a structure even a computer can be
a type of structure a building of course
is obviously a type of structure it is
something that is made of many different
parts it has many parts to it
made by people this is very famous i
think it's uh near qatar or near abu
dhabi
in the middle east very famous i forgot
exactly where this was but they made the
islands like this and then they put
houses on them wow it's really cool so
made by people but it's not natural
that's the point here this you
you're not sailing your boat you go oh
look uh the island looks like a palm
tree
it's not natural it didn't happen by
nature it happened because it was man
made people designed it they thought
about it they designed it and they made
it it's man-made
our experience our life on earth now we
are surrounded by man-made things
three thousand years ago most of the
world was natural there weren't many
man-made things but nowadays we live in
we live there are many man-made things
cities uh resorts uh buildings
everything in your house man-made okay
a large
triangle-shaped building so we talked
about this before right it's a triangle
it means it has three sides right a
triangle and it's shaped like a triangle
of course what did we call i'm not
talking about this right i'm talking
about this here a large triangle-shaped
building is a pyramid and i talked about
that right we said the pyramids of giza
right not the sphinx the sphinx is
separate it's there it's it's part of
the architecture but um the pyramid is
what we're talking about here triangle
shaped building
now to be around for a period of time
he looks so happy doesn't he okay so to
be around for a period of time is to
last right he's thinking
how long is this lesson going to last
i hope you're not thinking that i hope
this is exciting but he's not very
excited about the lesson he has a
hinduro job right he has to teach this
this young boy maybe math or something
like that but how long is it going to
last how long will it be around will it
be around for one week one month
a hundred years
how long will something last how long
will it last okay next one
a building where people practice
religion so of course many people in the
world are religious and there are
different religions there are different
buildings
one of those buildings is called a
church
people who are christian
go to a church people who are jewish go
to a temple or synagogue people who are
muslim they go to a mosque okay so there
are many different buildings where
people practice religion this one we can
see it's christian because of the cross
so we call it a church but different
religions will call their buildings
different names this is for the
christian religion okay
a set of steps built between two floors
so if you have steps like this built
between two floors what can we call it
we can call it stairs
and notice the s
because there are many of them right so
we always talk about it in the plural
because of course you have to have many
stairs not just one if you had only one
there wouldn't be that wouldn't be
stairs right you'd have to jump up there
can you jump that high you can't so we
need a series we need many steps we need
many stairs to go from one floor
to the next floor stairs
next one a passage built underground of
course in korea you can find many of
those in seoul there are many of these
you know korea has many mountains
so and the roads have to go you know
straight
but there's a mountain so you need to
make what through the mountain you need
to make a
tunnel so you make a tunnel through the
mountain so the road doesn't have to go
up you know and around and it takes too
long just go straight through the
mountain and make a tunnel okay
a large machine that moves dirt or rock
okay
what is this machine we call it a
bulldozer but to tell you the truth this
isn't actually a bulldozer i actually
worked at a company where we had where
there were many machines like this when
i was in america we call this actually a
front end loader front
end
loader
a bulldozer has a big blade on the front
and it can move up and down but it
doesn't scoop up dirt a bulldozer pushes
dirt so a bulldozer is one of those
machines you see that pushes dirt in
front of it this is a front end loader
it's used for scooping up dirt and
putting it into a big truck but a large
machine that moves dirt or rock that
would be a bulldozer it just pushes it
out of the way
okay
something that makes us wonder
a lot of the things that we saw before
like the pyramids of giza the eiffel
tower the taj mahal when we see those we
go wow that's amazing how did people
build that right it makes us imagine uh
what people a long time ago how they
lived how they could do those types of
things well not maybe not so much for
the eiffel tower but for the pyramids
sure and also for this one this is
stonehedge in england
something that makes us wonder we can
call it a marvel it is a marvel right
and that's where the word marvelous
comes from right ous by the way means
full of so if something is full of
marvel it is full of wonder right uh it
is marvel it is a marvel that's noun
adjective it is marvelous
you look marvelous okay so for example
okay next one
to make objects by cutting wood or stone
so there are some types of artists
that make works of art
from
wood or stone what are they doing
they are carving they carve the wood
they carve the stone to make
beautiful marvelous shapes
okay so they carve you can carve soap be
careful with the knife right be careful
you can carve soap to make little
statues okay but you can carve something
to make a piece of art okay now let's
review the words we just learned let's
see how well you remember that with a
exercise so let's take a look our our
instructions are here choose the word
that best completes the sentence so our
words are here under each sentence and
we need to fill in the blank with one of
these words number one
johnny an exclamation mark so i have to
say johnny
don't beep your blanket in the dirt
think about little johnny he has a
blanket right the blanket should be
clean but what is he doing he's doing
something maybe he's walking and the
blanket is in the dirt what's happening
don't control your blanket in the dirt
that doesn't make sense don't drag a
drag don't drag your blanket in the dirt
if you have a blanket right and you're
not holding on to it like this you just
hold one end and the other end is on the
ground and you're walking along
the blanket is dragging in the dirt and
it's getting dirty mom doesn't like this
don't do that okay
so
don't drag your blanket in the dirt not
don't run that doesn't make sense don't
cut your blanket in the dirt why would
you cut your blanket that doesn't make
sense the best answer is drag don't drag
your blanket in the dirt mom doesn't
like it it gets very dirty
okay number two
we need a beep for the rest of the food
so imagine this you're eating lunch
right but you're full ah pebble right i
can't eat anymore right
no more pebbles so you have but there's
food left what are you going to do with
it you're going to throw it away no
that's wasteful
you're going to store it
and put it in the refrigerator what do
you put it in we need something for the
rest of the food we need something to
put the food in
what is it a structure a structure like
a small building no
we don't put it in a small building do
we need a container
yes that's what we talked about when i
said container i said your mom probably
has many containers
in the refrigerator she keeps food in
them so we need a container for the rest
of the food do we need a tomb
no don't keep your food in a tomb that's
weird okay and church
don't keep your food in a church i mean
you can you might be able to eat food in
a church but that's kind of rude don't
do that they do eat one type of food in
the church but that's a long story
anyway
so the best word is of course container
we need a container for the rest of the
food you need something to store your
food in that's a container okay number
three
my uncle owns a jet airplane wow
the uncle is very he has a lot of money
if he has a jet airplane he has a lot of
money what do we say a person who has a
lot of money he is so what he is so
architect doesn't make sense that's not
correct grammar anyway he is so man-made
that's just silly
his mom and his dad made him no that's
we don't say that uh he is so rich
because he owns a jet airplane like i
said that costs a lot of money he is so
handsome it doesn't matter if he's
handsome or ugly if he owns a plan
anybody can own a plane it doesn't
matter what they look like
what matters is how much money they have
you need a lot of money to own a jet
airplane so he is so rich
number four this new car is hard to beep
it is too big
if you of course you don't drive but if
you have a small car a small car is easy
to drive you can turn it very quickly
but a big car it takes more power now
when you're driving it you know you have
to steer it different places you have to
try to what
you have to understand your car oh car i
understand you no we don't worry about
that it's a machine we don't worry about
understanding the car
we need to sit
it's hard to sit you sit your car sit
car no that's strange the car is just a
machine
it's hard to control okay that's the
answer because a big car right you need
a lot of power to turn it or to get it
to go or to get it to stop
so that's the right answer this new car
is hard to control it's too big a big
car is harder to control not hard to
look so the answer is this car is hard
to control it is too big
moving on number five the toilet is
broken
when we talked about this word i told i
talked about that said you have many
pipes coming in your house and going out
of your house your sink your toilet
we need new if the toilet is broken if
those pipes are broken what do we call
that system of pipes if you remember we
called it plumbing we need new plumbing
not bulldozers not containers not
churches plumbing plumbing is the system
of pipes in your house that controls
your sink your toilet uh that's about it
in your house your shower
okay
six rob built a big what out of wooden
blocks
he built what he built a big
something he used wooden blocks to build
it it's probably a structure because a
structure is like a building you don't
build plumbing out of wooden blocks
wood does not make for good plumbing
right because it doesn't hold water very
well it's very hard to shape wood
built a big man-made that's an adjective
not a noun and dedication that doesn't
fit that doesn't make sense the best one
of course is you build a structure a
structure like i said is a building it
could be a small building it could be a
large building okay so he built a
structure out of wooden blocks
now
number seven
when my grandfather died we built a what
for his body remember we talked about
that that was our first word
when somebody dies people think well
what to do with the body i talked about
three different ways grave cremate or
what was the last one the last one was
tomb when my grandfather died we built
a tomb for his body and that's actually
the only answer because you don't build
a grave you dig a grave
you don't build a cremate you that
doesn't make sense but a tomb is like a
structure so you build a structure you
build a tomb so because of this really
the only possibility is tomb well
you wouldn't build a tunnel or an
apartment for a dead body right you
would build a tomb
okay number eight the beep mountain
isn't as big as a real mountain
so think about that a real mountain in
this case real can be natural okay so
what's the opposite of natural the
opposite of natural is
man-made okay so the man-made mountain
isn't as big as a real mountain if you
think about it people might make a
mountain
for some reason part of the neighborhood
part of a park but it's very difficult
to
make a mountain as big as a real or
natural mountain right so the man-made
mountain isn't as big as a real mountain
okay
that wraps up the vocabulary section of
lesson two let's take a short break
we'll come back and take a look at the
reading don't go away
do
[Music]
hello everybody and welcome back to
reading for vocabulary i'm brian stewart
well we're on our last lesson for unit
one talking about architecture in lesson
three we're going to be talking about a
famous architect right we've talked
about the architect as a job we've
talked about examples of famous
architecture around the world now let's
talk about a famous person who is an
architect and his name is frank lloyd
wright
uh we can see many of his buildings
still around today we're going to focus
on let's learning about frank lloyd
wright well who was frank lloyd wright
what did he look like there he is he he
looks very thoughtful of course this is
an old picture frank lloyd wright lived
a while ago he's not living anymore
and he designed many famous buildings in
america
um he kind of looks like einstein right
very thoughtful with the white hair but
anyway this is him he's very he was a
very famous architect now what are some
of the buildings that he left behind
this is an example of a house this house
was designed by frank lloyd wright in
fact he designed and he had built many
different houses and if you're lucky and
if you are an owner of this house you
can be very proud and of course the
house is is quite expensive though
but they're very well designed and
they're very easy to live in they're
very
good design they look and feel very nice
also frank lloyd wright didn't just
design houses he designed lots of
different types of buildings also he
designed different types of structures
that are like monuments or statues and
this is this is an example of one of the
monuments or statues that frank lloyd
wright
created so architects don't just
create one type of building like a house
or an office building they do many
different things architects can be very
creative and build all sorts of
different structures and we'll read
about that later but before we get to
the reading we should go over the
vocabulary
the first word we're going to study here
is the word to describe something that
doesn't go straight now if a road goes
straight we say okay it's straight it
doesn't have any what it doesn't have
any
curves okay if you see a road that goes
to the right or it goes to the left we
say it has a curve we can say there is a
curve in the road be careful slow down
if you're riding your bike it's you can
go fast if it's straight but slow down
on a curve
okay next word now looks like this is
the she lives here right she's answering
the door and she is coming by why she is
someone who goes to a place for a short
time who what do we call this person we
call this person a visitor
she is visiting her
she is visiting her right so she is a
visitor
to her home okay if you come to my house
you are a visitor to my house if i go to
your house i am a visitor to your house
a visitor
the next one to change how someone
thinks or acts
so if you want to change the way someone
behaves maybe you don't like their
behavior or maybe you want to improve
their behavior like for example in a
sports game you need to influence you
need to influence them so the fact that
mom and dad are they like to play tennis
they like to play sports that will
influence their daughter she will grow
up and she will like to play sports too
because they're changing how how someone
else thinks or acts you influence them
who has influenced you in your life
next one
the area around something okay so if we
say that like there's many buildings in
a city what do we call the area around
the buildings we call it the environment
it's also the area around us right we
can have different environments if we
are in the city we say we are in an
urban
urban environment urban means city we
are in the city that's the type of
environment we're in but if we go to the
country then we say we are in a
r i'm sorry i was thinking about the
pronunciation
a rural
be careful because pronunciation is
right r and l
rural rural means you're in the country
so you can have an urban environment
that's in the city or you can have a
rural
environment there's just one l
that's out in the countryside so
different environments it's the area
what is your environment like
next one wow very pretty looks like
somewhere in europe maybe switzerland
it's very pretty if we talk about the
land being very pretty we can say it's
beautiful also another specific word for
the land we say it's scenic.
scenic so beautiful very pretty it's
beautiful if we're talking about the
land the landscape we say it's scenic in
switzerland it's very scenic countryside
it's very beautiful countryside next one
to have information about if you have
information about something you know it
so what information do you have inside
your head
that's the same as asking what do you
know now no is an irregular verb so we
use it when we're talking in the past
quago right we say no
chigum
nu
chane
and non maybe for a long time i have
known that for a long time so to know no
new known
ah
did you know i was from america yeah
i've known that for months okay uh
i knew that before okay and what do you
know now no new known okay next one
useful items in our home that we can
move around so there are many useful
items you can sit on them you can put
things inside them there are containers
you can put things on top of them so
we're talking about chairs sofas tables
cabinets useful items in our home that
but we can move them around they're not
fixed right this is a fireplace we're
not talking about that you can't move
the fireplace right it stays there but
the things you can move around we call
furniture
furniture
be careful
when we say furniture we mean everything
furniture is non-count
don't
no no s at the end of furniture
never say furnitures
it's furniture there's a lot of
furniture in this room or there's only
one piece of furniture in this room okay
there's a little furniture or there's a
lot of furniture but don't use s it's
non-count okay
to finish doing something important you
finish doing something important right
so you have achieved something to
achieve
what have you achieved in your life
right you've graduated from different
grades in elementary school maybe you're
going on to middle school or starting
high school you've achieved uh you've
successfully achieved graduating from
these different grades
you maybe got an a on a test hopefully
more than one test you've achieved
you've made many achievements
okay so you have achieved something now
achieve meant
as one word that's the noun but achieve
just achieve that's the verb what did
you achieve i have many achievements
okay next one
natural like plants and animals when we
go to the store and we buy something we
want to look for maybe organic
foods organic means they were made
naturally think about that we think well
plants are natural what are you talking
about the thing is the idea there is
that
for a long time
many plants are grown using chemicals
or man-made products but sometimes this
might be unhealthy those chemicals might
not be good for our bodies so now people
are more concerned or are interested in
foods that are grown completely
naturally
with no chemicals no man-made chemicals
and we call that type of food organic
nothing unnatural was used to make these
plants no unnatural chemicals for
example
okay next one different from everything
else so and this is a good example
because this is what we call a finger
print and if you think about it
i have a print on my finger right you
have a print on your finger but if we
put them here side by side they will be
different why
because everybody has a unique
unique means one of a kind you're the
only person
with that fingerprint in the world
isn't that interesting right of course
um
police use fingerprints to find
criminals right so maybe it's not great
but of course you're not a you will you
won't do anything bad but think about
that the fingerprint that you have on
your finger is different from your
sister it's different from your brother
is different from your mom or your dad
you are unique only you have that
certain pattern on your fingers you are
unique and not just in fingerprints but
in many other ways too
okay the next word is this ojim malio io
is my pronunciation okay that's a
difficult word for me to pronounce but
if you have to go to the bathroom if you
have to go to the bathroom where we go
to the bathroom you use this device here
it's kind of like an appliance what do
we call it we call it a toilet so i need
to use the toilet is very common i need
to use the toilet now some people when
they're in a department store or they're
in a movie theater and you need to use a
toilet some people might say excuse me
where is the toilet now in that case
they might be talking about the room
maybe they don't have to use the toilet
maybe they just want to wash their face
or or change their clothes right for
some reason
in that case you can also say where is
the rest
room
or where is the
bath
room
it's actually
it's actually more polite
to say where is the restroom than to say
where is the toilet so if you want to be
polite it's better to say where is the
restroom you can say bathroom but most
common for public places we say excuse
me where is the restroom and then you
can tell your friend i have to use the
toilet but
you know it's more polite to say
restroom anyway so but we use the toilet
in the restroom next word
okay now in this word we have water
going from a high place to a
lower place it's a lot of water and
we're talking about a lot of water not a
little water but a lot of water like a
river right or a large stream
going from a high place to a low place
and it's a very easy word when you think
about it because we're talking about
water what does the water do it's
falling so we say it's a waterfall very
easy word right water water fall
waterfall it's not a verb it's a noun a
waterfall and there are many famous
waterfalls in the world
okay
done with no mistakes wow look at that a
plus big percent choil right so done
with no mistakes what do we call that we
say he did it
perfectly
now l-y means it's an adjective i'm
sorry adverb and that defines the verb
so he
uh
did
it
perfect
lee because perfectly we're describing
how did he do it
right but we can also use just the word
perfect
his
score
is
perfect
now in this case it's an adjective
because we're talking about a noun we're
describing a noun his score is perfect
he did it perfectly okay so that's the
difference using l y are we describing
the verb or are we describing the noun
how did you do on your last test did you
do it perfectly did you have a perfect
score i hope so okay let's move on a
hard cover for some sea animals do you
like to go to the beach on the beach
when you're walking along you have the
water and the sand and right next to
where the water comes you can find many
hard coverings these are parts of
animals right they're not stones
they're parts of animals animals made
those what do we call them we call them
sea shells and as you can see they can
be very beautiful and different designs
and some people like to collect them
okay but try not to collect too much of
them in some places because the next
person who goes there there's no
seashells so sometimes it's best just to
leave things in nature and just look at
it appreciate it but leave it there for
the next person to come and enjoy it too
okay but seashells
okay next one
a long floor that goes up
unfortunately there are people who are
handicapped they
cannot move
normally so we need to
help them and one way to help them is
like this if you look at this boy you
think how can he go upstairs if there's
a building and there are only stairs in
the building
it's very terrible for him how does he
get into the building so many buildings
will build these long floors that go up
to help handicap people who are in
wheelchairs
we call these areas ramps they're a ramp
it's a nice gentle slope that you can go
up in a wheelchair or for other people
maybe older people or people who are
injured and they have a hard time they
can go up the ramp more easily than
other people who just climb up the
stairs
okay the next one
the act of finding new information
so this is what scientists do all the
time they're trying to find new
information so they do research
usually when we talk about research of
course scientists do a lot of research
but many other people do research too
right uh professors at the university if
their if their subject is literature
they're researching the old text about
maybe william shakespeare or some other
famous uh author from a long time ago
if you are an artist you will do
research by researching famous painters
in history or
famous painters or new modern trends in
painting when you find new information
you are doing research and be careful
here research is a non-count noun
people do research we don't do
researches we do research okay so the
scientists have a lot of inch are doing
a lot of interesting research it's
non-count don't put an s on the end of
it or yes
okay
now let's review the words that we have
just learned and uh with some exercises
the instructions are choose the word
that best completes the sentence these
are our words we need to find one
the best one to put into these blanks
number one
you should beep more in school
somebody's always telling you this right
sorry
you don't work hard enough okay so
you should what in more in school you
should influence more in school you
should influence your friends that
doesn't make sense you should allow
allow that doesn't make allow what uh
you should sleep more yes that's it you
should sleep more in school no
absolutely not i'm sorry
i didn't say that shh okay
you should achieve more in school that
makes sense okay that's the right one
don't sleep more in school okay i'm just
kidding
you should achieve more in school in
other words you if somebody doesn't work
hard enough let's say your friend
is a little lazy they don't study hard
enough they get bad grades on their on
their tests
you could say you don't achieve
enough you should achieve more in school
you don't work hard enough okay so work
harder achieve more
okay number two
now don't forget number one you should
achieve more in school okay number two
that lady is beep she should be a movie
star when you watch the movies when you
when you look at the movies these days
normally movies aren't really real right
the people in the movies are always
very good looking right
especially it's interesting when you
look at movies that are based on a true
story right and you look at the actors
the actors are always usually much
better looking than the people who the
story is based on right that's very
interesting but that's part of
entertainment so what what can we say
that lady is beyond
beyond means she's further away that
doesn't make sense
she is beautiful ah she's beautiful
that's probably the right answer she she
is achieved you can't say somebody is
achieve achieve is a verb not an
adjective so that doesn't make sense
that lady is perfectly no remember
perfectly describes a verb not a noun
so
that wouldn't work if you said that lady
is perfect that could be an answer but
this is perfect lee so it doesn't fit
grammatically
the best answer of course is beautiful
like i said before that's probably your
answer that lady is beautiful she should
be a movie star because
when we look at movies usually the
beautiful people are the movie stars
that's changing recently nowadays there
are more and more people who look like
real people in the movies and that's
maybe a good thing too because it really
should be based on talent not beauty
okay
three
the road beep up ahead be ready to turn
remember when i talked about this i said
if the road is straight
you don't have to be so careful but if
the road it does this right you have to
be ready to turn right so what does the
road do does the road influences does it
achieves does it curves does it fits
the road
of course curves up ahead the road
curves so be ready to turn
remember a curve can be to the right
or inchokuro or it can be to the left
when chokoro or jayajan right um still
learning my korean okay so it can curve
either direction to the right or to the
left be ready to turn turn right or turn
left
okay
four
do you beep what the homework is for
tonight
so if your teacher gave you some
homework
right and you were sleeping
you don't what
oh sorry that's cursed you don't know
what the homework is so you ask your
friend do you know what the homework is
for tonight do you know what the
homework is for tonight you wouldn't say
do you chance that's not right do you
believe that doesn't fit and do you
research no do you know if you have the
information in your head you have the
answer in your head then you know it if
you don't have the answer in your head
you're going to try to find it then you
will research it but we don't say do you
research we say do you know because we
want to know do you know the information
or don't you know the information do you
know
what the homework is for tonight and we
can use many words here do you know how
do you know where
do you know when
do you know why
do you know who okay so we can use lots
of these question words here after do
you know
and we want to know if you know that
information or not do you know how to
get to school do you know where i live
do you know when
the test is do you know why we're having
a test do you know who our teacher is
right if you know this information you
can use these question words after do
you know to find
out that information from your friends
okay let's continue
no do you know what the homework is for
tonight okay next one number five
many people go to the new museum every
year so when you go to a museum you go
there for a short time you don't live
there you don't stay there you go there
for a short time and then you leave so
what types of
what can we describe that situation many
environments environments don't go to
museums right visitors ah visitors go
for a short time that's our answer many
visitors go to the new museum every year
not faster not sea seashells go to the
museum
maybe there might be an exhibit on the
uh about seashells but they don't go
there every year that's kind of silly
okay let's move on to number six
where i live the beep is cold and snowy
so we're talking about
the area around you it can also be just
around you or around your house it's the
area in which you live is cold and snowy
that's the space that surrounds you what
word is that the furniture is cold and
snowy furniture can't be snowy furniture
can be cold but not snowy
the the visitor is cold and snowy that
doesn't make sense the environments ah
the environment the space around you
like the country around you is cold and
snowy maybe you live far in the north
the environment is cold and snowy
not the influence so where i live the
environment is cold and snowy okay let's
move on to number seven
all the beep in our house is made of
wood so what do you have inside your
house
that might be made of wood and it's
typically usually made of wood think
about your bed think about your chair
think about your table your desk right
these things what do we call these
things we call them inside no do we call
them visitors no people are not made of
wood
okay
do we call them furniture yes we call
them furniture all the furniture in our
house is made of wood not all the
beautiful beautiful is an adjective not
a noun it doesn't fit so the best one is
furniture all the furniture in our house
is made of wood and that's typical
usually furniture is made of wood number
eight my teacher beep me in a good way i
work harder now so if your teacher has
done something
to change your behavior so that you work
harder now what did your teacher do did
your teacher visitor you that doesn't
make sense grammatically did your
teacher achieves you
again that doesn't make sense
grammatically your teacher knows you in
a good way
that's a little strange
your teacher influences ah your teacher
influences me in a good way it changed
my behavior in a good way
okay so that's the answer there my
teacher influences me in a good way now
i work harder so people who inspire you
people who you want to follow or copy
they may influence you to change your
behavior or the way that you think
okay well that wraps it up for the
vocabulary section let's take a short
break and we'll start with the reading
section soon don't go away
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary are you ready to continue
talking about our subject of sports well
we're on lesson four the human machine
the human machine
it's like people are machines right
think about some famous athletes that
you know right like pak ji sang or or
pak taiwan right the swimmer they're
like machines in the water or on the
soccer field right
how do they get to be such strong
athletes that's what we're going to
focus on how can someone become a great
athlete well of course it's going to
take a lot of hard work right but in the
reading passage we'll take a look at how
someone becomes a great athlete and if
you want to become a great athlete what
can you do to become a great athlete so
we're going to take a look at that but
first as always let's take a look at the
vocabulary so our first vocabulary word
is
someone who plays a sport
we just talked about that right
how can someone become a great what what
is this person she is running she is an
athlete she is an athlete okay so
pronunciation athlete
if you compete in a sport and that's
like your not just your hobby but also
sometimes your job you're an athlete if
you play sports well and you do it a lot
okay
the ability to do something the ability
to do something like if you have the
ability to create such a beautiful sand
castle right we can say you have a lot
of skill
of course athletes need skill right
but also many other types of people need
skill artists need skill engineers need
skill lawyers need skill skill is
something it's an ability that you
develop either through training through
practice through study but it's a skill
what kind of skills do you have for
example
okay number three
here's a signpost right the measure of
space between two things right buenos
aires is 7
270 kilometers that way so when we
measure the space between two things
we're talking about the distance how far
something is away so from me to buenos
aires or me to busan right what is the
distance
how many kilometers or how many miles
right okay
next one after some time
so when we look at this what is this by
the way this is a tad pole
now
later on this tadpole we know maybe you
know what will it become it will become
a frog right
river okay so but it will take some time
eventually eventually means after
a certain amount of time usually kind of
like a long time this tadpole is not
going to become a frog right away it's
going to take some time eventually the
tadpole will become a frog eventually
young children will grow up to be adults
it'll take some time but eventually it
will happen after some time okay
number five repeating something so you
get better at it now your english
teacher probably always tells you this
what do they say they say practice
practice practice okay it's not just
english piano right if you're learning
to play a musical instrument
whether it's a piano a trumpet or
whatever you have to practice
if you're playing a sport and you want
to get better at it what do you do you
practice so any skill remember we talked
about skills skills our abilities how do
you improve your ability you practice
whatever it is you practice you get
better at it so do it again and again
repeating it so that you get better at
it okay next one number six
equal
and even if something is equal and even
we say it is balanced right it is
perfectly balanced because it's equal
and it is even on both sides it's
balanced sometimes well a little bit
different idea we can also say it's fair
if two teams two soccer teams are
playing one team has 12 players the
other team has eight players it's not
balanced it's not fair
so both teams have to have 11 players
and that's a balanced
team that is a fair competition okay
next one seven
done all the way so if something is
um
finished or if all the things are in
place we say that it is complete it or
something is done all the way something
has finished a process you can think
about complete in different ways in this
case we're thinking all the tools are in
a sets or everything is together it's
complete but you can also think about a
painting when the painting is finished
we say it is complete it's finished okay
eight
now this is very interesting isn't it
this is from this is how a butterfly
comes out of the cocoon remember before
it was a caterpillar
so a caterpillar changes into a new
state into a butterfly what do we say
we say becomes a caterpillar becomes
a butterfly a caterpillar becomes a
butterfly a child becomes an adult a
tadpole becomes a frog and become is an
irregular verb so we say become became
become okay
become became become it's interesting
that this is the same as the present
tense right the past perfect okay
next one nine
there are many books here italy turkey
beijing mexico india what are these
books about they tell you
how to do something they tell you how to
travel through italy they tell you how
to travel through mexico what is it it
is a guide these books are guides to
different cities
but a guide can be many different things
a guide can be a book
a guide can be a person right if you're
on a tour there's a tour guide who tells
you and shows you the different places
and how to look at them or or how to
think sometimes about these places or
what to know
so a guide can be many different types
of things it shows you how to do
something a guide could also be an
instruction manual you get a computer
and you need to how do i you know hook
up all the cables you look at the guide
okay
10.

unfortunately it's not important for our
bodies having a lot of sugar
is sugary a lot of candy and this is
like gummy gummy candy of course it's
very sugary
chocolate has a lot of sugar in it um
hard candy all very sugary treats and
snacks so be careful of those our body
doesn't need them it's not a very
important for our body especially our
teeth got to be careful just mail okay
next one
12
happening many times over a time period
if you're using a computer you're
probably hitting certain keys again and
again you're hitting them very often so
you hit certain keys very often like the
enter key or the space bar you hit that
very often
okay
next one oh what is he he's a juggler
right to throw and catch many things at
once we say juggle this is the verb to
juggle he is juggling we can call him
what is his name he is a juggler right
the person is a juggler if he's doing it
we say he is a juggler what is he doing
he is juggling
to juggle is the verb okay to throw and
catch many things at once can you juggle
can you do that
if you want to develop that skill that
ability you have to practice okay next
one
14. yay that looks like fun can you

can do that
incredible wow really incredible amazing
so if you he can do this if he can jump
wow that's incredible amazing right
okay next one this is also incredible
and amazing right very incredible
costumes a special happening something
special that happens we call it an event
okay for example the olympics every four
years that is an event sometimes there
will be a festival in different cities
in venice or new orleans
they will be events right a parade in
seoul is an event any thing that happens
it's special it's an event there's so
many events happening all the time even
in seoul even in in your in your town
probably there are many events
last one number 16 the ability to do
difficult things
can you believe it can he is it real is
it true i think it's trick photography
unless maybe he's bruce willis then it's
true no i'm just kidding
the ability to do difficult things
strength if somebody has a lot of
strength they have the ability to do
difficult things i don't think this this
is real it's a trick photography but
think about it if you can lift a lot of
things if you can pick up a very heavy
weight you have a lot of strength
okay so those are the words we need to
know for the reading
let's make sure we remember those words
let's take a little short quiz on some
of those words choose the word that best
completes the sentence here are the
words we need to fill in the blanks with
the best word okay
number one you need to beep your english
if you want to get better we talked
about this it's not just english it
could be practicing
a musical instrument like the piano the
trumpet or whatever
what do you need to do do you need to
define
do you need to become
do you need to practice or do you need
to skill well skill right away we see
that's a noun that doesn't make sense
define become practice those are verbs
and they would fit with two right two we
need a verb but define become practice
if you want to get better at something
you need to do it again and again you
need to practice right you need to
practice your english if you want to get
better you need to practice playing
soccer if you want to get better at
playing soccer you need to practice
playing the piano if you want to be a
better piano player okay so practice you
need to do something
you need to practice if you want to get
better okay number two
i need to beep my homework before i can
go to the movies i need to what my
homework what do you do with your
homework that you want to do you want to
get it done right so do you want to put
your homework do you want to become you
want to become my homegirl i want to
become a book that's crazy
i want to drop my homework or i want to
complete my homework what makes sense
well obviously if you looked at complete
that's the one that makes sense complete
means finish i want to complete my
homework i want to finish my homework
before i can go to the movies not put
not become and not drop you know drop
your homework let's see let's go
upstairs and drop it from the roof no
don't do that okay that's not a good
idea you want to complete your homework
before you can go to the movies okay
next one three you're so good at base
basketball oh baseball sorry baseball
you're so good that means ah chale right
you're so good at it right you should be
a professional what
if a person plays a sport especially for
their job they get paid for it they are
professional and they are playing a
sport and they're getting paid for it
what do we call that job doctor lawyer
engineer or what skill train athlete
event which one of these words is a
description of an actual job well of
course c
an athlete is a description of a
particular job an athlete is someone who
plays a sport a professional athlete is
someone who plays a sport and gets money
for it
right you think about it that's crazy
right somebody gets paid for throwing a
ball or running fast well in our society
it's true people some people get paid a
lot of money
to uh to to play these games like for
example think of tiger woods he gets
millions of dollars for playing golf
sounds like a dream job right of course
they have a lot of talent they have a
lot of skill and they've worked very
hard to attain that skill
okay number four
in a few days the seed will beep a plant
so again a seed of course is like an
apple seed or
some other
part of the plant that you put in the
ground and then after a while it
eventually grows into a plant right
so first you have a seed
later you have a plant right what
happens to the seed it what
it completes it becomes it eventually
or it guides
of course we know the answer oops
the answer is become in a few days the
seed will become a plant
so it will change from one thing
to another thing it will become a plant
okay so
let's move on to number five
that beep is too great no one could ever
swim that far
okay so we we kind of know the answer
right here if you're looking at wow
there's an island out there be careful
it's very far away
right that what is too great that event
that guide that incredible or that
distance
is too great remember the the
measurement from point a
here to point b over there we're talking
about distance
so we say that distance is too great the
distance is too great no one could ever
swim that far the distance is too great
so the right answer is distance
six your english
beep has improved a lot
all that practice has paid off so again
we're kind of talking about that idea
again practice you practice something a
lot to improve what do you want to
improve
you improve your ability at something
what is ability skill repeat grow or
learn did you say skill
then you would be correct because skill
is ability you practice a skill to
become better at it your english skill
has improved a lot
all that practice has paid off
practice has paid off means you
practiced a lot
so you got the reward you were
successful right if something is
successful it has paid off you were
successful
okay number seven
beep i will usually i will start eating
better just not right now so not right
now not now
some other time later what mean what
does that mean what what
mean what what word within the blank a
usually i will start eating better
usually i will start eating better that
doesn't make sense because usually
is for
things that happen habitually so we
don't use future tense with usually
completely i will start eating better
that doesn't make sense suddenly i will
start eating better that's isaan hail
eventually ah eventually not right now
but later so eventually is the answer
eventually not now but after some time
eventually i will start eating better
a lot of us we sometimes lazy so we say
eventually i'll do it i'll do it
eventually okay but not right now okay
maybe you should start right now if you
want to do something do it now don't
wait for eventually do it now
okay
eight a or add beep meal will keep you
healthy
we talk about eating we have to eat
certain things right a different things
we have to eat a certain amount of
carbohydrates or bread and potatoes and
rice
right we have to eat a certain amount of
protein like in meat we have to eat a
certain amount of we have to drink a
certain amount of other things like milk
or cheese dairy products okay so we have
to make sure we eat all these things and
in the right parts right so
what kind of meal should we have all
meat no we need meat vegetables
something to drink
you know we need a what kind of meal a
balanced meal a sugary meal an exercise
meal or an energy meal
well right away we know sugary meal will
not keep us healthy that's got too much
sugar in it an exercise meal doesn't
make sense because we're looking for an
adjective right
something to modify meal exercise is not
an adjective and energy is an adjective
an energy meal but that doesn't sound
right that doesn't make sense what we're
looking for is balanced a balanced meal
a balanced meal has the right amount of
each food group and you eat it and it's
good for you because it's balanced you
get enough protein you get carbohydrates
you get enough vitamins and minerals
it's a balanced meal and it keeps you
healthy not too much sugar right maybe a
little sugar is okay but not too much
you need to eat the things in balance
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
section let's take a short break here
and we'll come back and look at the
reading how to become a great athlete so
don't go away we'll be right back
[Music]
hello kids how are you today welcome
back to reading for vocabulary are you
excited to learn about sports do you
like sports
do you like to play sports or do you
like to watch sports maybe you like to
do both okay well we're going to talk
about sports in this lesson and we're
going to be focusing on the ancient
olympics so let's learn about the
history of the olympics so you know
about the olympics right the olympics
where every country in the world
competes and there's television and you
can watch it on tv and you can cheer for
your own nation of course that happens
every four years but we're not talking
about the modern olympics we're talking
about the ancient olympics in this
lesson ancient means a long long time
ago
thousands of years ago before television
right before many nations in the world
there was the ancient olympics and these
were held in greece okay athletes
athletes from different
cities in ancient greece would get
together and they would compete they
would have a contest in many different
sports
where would they do it they would do it
under mount olympus mount olympus is
where the greeks thought the gods lived
at the top of the mountain and the
mountain was called olympus and so they
called it the olympic games and like i
said from many different cities in
greece the athletes would come and
compete and of course ancient greece is
very famous right for not only many old
buildings and many impressive and
beautiful
structures but also because of their
culture and their way of thinking but
they were the ones who created the
olympics in the beginning thousands of
years ago the ancient olympics so that's
what we're going to read about in this
lesson but before we do that let's learn
some vocabulary okay and our first word
is a person who is very famous of course
you know many people who are famous
singers actors on television actors in
the movie what do we call these people
it starts with a c
it is
celebrity
celebrity is a person who is very very
famous and everybody knows who that
person is
okay what's the next word the next word
is a bird no it's not a bird it's a
thing or idea that can represent another
idea the example is a bird the example
is a dove when people see a dove what do
they think of they think of peace so the
dove is a symbol
a symbol of peace so if you can look at
animals you can look at flags the teguki
the korean flag is a symbol for korea
right so it's a thing or idea that can
represent another idea right so this
thing here the dove represents the idea
of peace okay next word
whoa he's very angry be careful joshua
right he's looks like very very uh
dangerous dog right strong and dangerous
right joshua hale so what is the word
that we use we use
it's not dog it's fierce
okay
fierce now i have a dog a beagle but
she's not fierce she's very lovable and
cute but this dog joshua right this dog
is very fierce strong and dangerous
okay next one
four
no smoking to let someone do something
to let someone do something is to allow
them to do something but if you have a
sign that says no smoking this would be
not allow someone to do something so the
picture and the word a little bit
mismatched but that's okay because
if we allow people to smoke here then
there's no sign right that means we let
them do something if your mother lets
you play video games after dinner then
she's allowing you to do that but do
your homework first okay okay
next one
ah a race to be part of a race or other
competition
what do we say we say it is compete to
be part this is a verb right because you
are part of a race or other competition
if you are in a race or another
competition it doesn't have to be a race
it could be a chess game maybe a chess
tournament or it could be a soccer game
right it could be anything where you
compete compete is a verb you it's like
you're not really fighting against
somebody but you're using your skill
against another person to win
you are competing okay and of course
compete is a verb and we have
competition right competition is the
noun and competition is a game or any
other contest where you use your skill
to win
okay next one
a feeling of doing well
so others can see a feeling of doing
well so others can see we say this is
pride right if he's on the football team
he's very young football player he won
right he has the trophy his team
won
the competition so he
has a lot of pride he has pride but be
careful he is proud so pride is the noun
we can say
he
shows
his pride
in this case pride is a noun but
be careful we can also say he is
proud which is also very common but in
this case proud is an adjective right
this is
noun okay so he shows his pride or he
has
pride
next he is
proud adjective so be careful with the
word form okay
next
more than normal if something is more
than normal what do we say we say
especially especially is kind of like
when you want to point out something in
particular some special case right
then we use especially okay
to go somewhere well perhaps when you're
older you can travel around the world
like this young girl is doing here she's
traveling looks like she's in france in
paris to go somewhere is to travel right
to travel you can travel around the
world
next
one this is a sport where athletes wear
gloves and hit each other you know this
sport right you've seen this before
these guys are being safe they're
wearing gloves and they're wearing a
padded helmet right what are they doing
right they're doing this sport it's not
wrestling not wrestling it is
boxing
boxing
now be careful boxing is a noun it's the
name of the sport a few days ago i was
in my neighborhood and i saw a poster
somebody opened a boxing gym and they
wanted to be funny do you know the movie
shall we dance
well they used that idea for the movie
title and on their on their poster they
put shall we boxing and i thought what
shall we boxing no
it should be
shall
we
box
because box is a verb
boxing is a noun right the movie is not
called shall we dancing no shall we
dance shall we box okay because box is
the verb so be careful again of the word
form ing is a noun boxing
i like boxing can you box okay next word
parts of a plant tied together in a
circle at christmas time we can see
these many people put them on their
doors they hang them on their doors it's
like happy christmas or merry christmas
right we call it a wreath okay but it's
not just for christmas
wreaths can be used for other occasions
but most common people think of a wreath
at christmas time this is a christmas
wreath but we'll see another kind of
wreath in the reading okay next one
oh don't look poncho
no i'm just kidding
right because it's
all right a little baby right but
usually babies they don't wear any
clothes it's obviously of course when
they're first born they're not wearing
clothes right so what do we say they are
naked
we come into this world naked right we
come into the world naked and
usually not so peaceful but this baby is
very peaceful very cute right so not
wearing any clothes somebody is naked
we'll see that in the reading okay next
one
being a girl or woman not male so if we
talk about you know there's there's
about fifty percent of the people in the
world are one sex or the other sex right
there's male and then there's
female female right so male and female
basically everybody in the world is
either male or female so about maybe a
little more than half
of the people in the world are female
okay so being a girl woman not male
next one
of course this is korea and you probably
know where this is the dmz right an
agreement that all fighting is stopped
right it's just an agreement and maybe
the fighting has stopped for just a
short time but there hasn't been a
formal agreement to stop it forever
right that's what korea is under right
now a truce you know south korea and
north korea they never had a peace
agreement they're just under a truce
technically they're still at war right
but they have had a truce for more than
60 years
so a truce is just a it's like a
temporary uh stop to the fighting
hopefully it will be permanent but
a truce and it's not just in korea
anywhere in the world where two
groups are fighting and they say let's
have a truce that means a temporary a
short period where there's no fighting
okay
a flat piece of metal given as a prize
he's proud too right he is proud he has
pride because why he has a medal
if you do something great whether in
school or you uh in sports you win a
game or you win a tournament
they might give you a medal soldiers
wear metals on their chest right so a
metal is a small piece of metal it's
usually decorated looks nice and it's
given as a prize it shows you were
excellent in doing something
okay
next one is to shout for something good
i talked about this before of course
it's to cheer when i talked about the
olympics i say you cheer for your
country don't you of course when you
watch the olympics every four years you
cheer for korea right uh deihan minguk
right you say
go korea right so you cheer for your
country or you cheer for your team you
shout you yell you go crazy right okay
next one a box that shows us moving
pictures a box that shows it what what
is that
i've have you ever seen one of those
before what could that be
oh it's a television of course
very common i'm just kidding of course
everybody knows what a television is
it's like a box well not anymore
it used to be a box now it's a very thin
screen right but it used to be like a
big box that was very heavy but
thankfully technology has moved on so
anyway television you're watching a
video screen right now maybe you're
watching this on television you're
probably watching it on your computer
screen but anyway television is where
you watch tv shows and movies okay
let's move on let's go over the
words the vocabulary okay let's see how
well you remember these words choose the
word that best completes the sentence we
have words down here we have a blank we
need to complete the sentence with these
words let's take a look i won't be
you to leave you haven't done your
homework
so mom says this when the the boy or
girl wants to go out and play but mom
says i won't
what you to leave you need to stay here
and finish your homework you haven't
done your homework you need to stay here
do your homework and then you can leave
then i will beep you to leave what i
will give you to leave that doesn't make
sense i will honor you to leave
that doesn't make sense i will compete
you to leave or i will allow you to
leave aha allow sounds like it would be
a good choice right i won't allow you to
leave
that's the answer i won't allow you to
leave i won't let you leave because you
haven't done your homework when you
finish your homework then i will allow
you then you can go then you are able to
leave right i will give you permission
okay
number two
there is a beep storm outside let's stay
in so you want to stay inside because
there's a storm outside it's raining or
it's snowing the wind is blowing very
strongly
it's very it could be dangerous strong
and dangerous so what can we say there
is a fierce storm
fierce means dangerous right strong and
dangerous right so there's a fierce
storm outside that sounds good let's
check the others there's a peaceful
storm oh peaceful it's very nice why
would we stay inside and have you ever
heard of a storm that is peaceful that
doesn't make sense
there is a rude storm
the wind's going by going yeah get out
of my way right that's crazy okay so c
doesn't work
d there's a slow storm outside let's
stay in in that's a little bit isang
hail the best word is fierce there's a
fierce storm outside let's stay in if
there's a fierce storm it means the wind
is blowing really strong it's very
dangerous okay so stay inside stay warm
and stay safe
i was beep tired today i only slept for
four hours so maybe you were playing
video games late last night no not video
games you were studying right you were
studying late last night so you only
slept for four hours
so if you if you only sleep for four
hours you're really tired right so how
do we
what word means kind of like really or
very
does less no less doesn't mean really or
very b slowly that doesn't make sense c
quickly i was quickly tired today
that's strange
so d i was especially aha especially
means more than normal like very or
really i was especially tired today i
only slept for four hours so the answer
of course is especially i was especially
tired today
okay next one number four
that flag is the beep of our nation i
talked about this before right when we
saw the picture of the dove but i also
gave you another example i said the
teguki the korean flag is the beep of
korea just like the stars and stripes is
the beep for america right a flag is a
what a flag is a symbol of a nation so
that flag is the symbol of our nation
not the treat not the top not the
celebrity but the symbol you see it and
you think of something else it's the
symbol of our nation okay next one
number five i don't want to beep in the
soccer game maybe you feel sick or
you're injured so you don't want to play
soccer right you don't want to
participate what word means play in a
game or participate in a contest
i don't want to forget in the soccer
game that doesn't make sense because we
don't use forget and in
i don't want to compete in the soccer
game compete
remember compete means to use your
skills to try to win in a contest and
that's what they're doing so compete is
probably our word but let's just check
i don't want to enjoy in the soccer game
that doesn't make sense because again we
don't say enjoy in
if in bego in begohmian right if in was
gone right we could use i don't want to
forget the soccer game i don't want to
enjoy the soccer game those would make
sense but because of in they don't make
sense
i don't want to allow the soccer game
also if in was not there then we could
say yeah it's possible i don't want to
allow the soccer game it's too noisy
for example i don't want to allow it but
because of in
because of in this one this one this one
and this one they don't make sense the
only one that makes sense is compete we
compete in a game we compete in a
contest so that's a good thing to
remember when you use the word compete
use the preposition in i want to compete
in the soccer game i want to compete in
the chess tournament i want to compete
in the tennis championships you compete
in something okay number six
that singer is my favorite beep she is
so
famous right we talked about what do we
call very famous people
engineer no
well some engineers can be famous but
engineers aren't normally famous right a
veterinarian
no a veterinarian is just an animal
doctor not a famous person see a
celebrity aha that's the word we talked
about before someone who's very very
famous is a celebrity that's the answer
right and d doctor no because doctor is
very similar to veterinarian this one
this one and this one are names of
specific jobs engineer
builds buildings or make sure things are
working like machines and things like
that veterinarian is a doctor who takes
care of animals and of course a doctor
takes care of people they're just normal
jobs but a celebrity doesn't really mean
a job it means a person who is very
famous but it could be for anything
singing acting or for something
that they did that was bad right usually
celebrities are positive though right
somebody who's famous but we don't know
what they do for a job they're just very
famous
okay next one number seven do you want
to beep to india with me what word makes
sense ask travel enjoy compete
do you want to compete to india with me

[Music]
hello everybody and welcome back to
reading for vocabulary we're continuing
with our subject of sports
and in this time we're talking the
lesson six is talking about playing
favorites playing favorites
that means we're going to focus on
let's think about your favorite sports
teams
so we think about playing favorites
we're going to think about who are your
favorite sports teams
and what do people do
to support their favorite sports teams
well we can say a lot of things about
that
of course when we think about our famous
our favorite sports teams
koreans are very enthusiastic about
cheering for their favorite sports teams
for example the korean national team
especially for example the korean
national soccer team do you remember the
2002 world cup maybe it's too long ago
you don't remember but um
at that time it was really really
a big event in korea this is at kwanghwa
moon square right a kwang-wa moon in
downtown seoul it's crazy oh i'm sorry
it's not quang moon cuango moon is over
here choki this is city hall this is
city hall i forgot because they changed
the building it looks different now
but look at this plaza
wow there's so many people i mean
there's a street here there's another
street here but there's so many people
you can't even see the streets no cars
today right because there are so many
people cheering for the 2002
soccer uh world soccer tournament right
which is called the world cup the world
soccer cup so it's amazing it was really
amazing i was actually in korea at this
time i remember driving over this is
kwanga moon over here remember driving
by my friend was on the back of my
motorcycle is taking pictures
it was pretty interesting and so yeah it
was really amazing so many people came
out and uh cheered for their soccer team
okay people will go crazy uh supporting
their
their team right these people here
what country has blue people
no i'm just kidding they're not really
blue they're using blue paint on their
faces to support the color of their
favorite team where are they from well
we can see from their headbands that it
looks like japanese that's the the flag
of japan right the sun the rising sun
and
these guys are japanese sports fans okay
so they're out cheering their team and
you see they're really enthusiastic
about cheering for their team they wear
crazy costumes and they paint their
faces or their bodies different colors
these guys are japanese fans we can whoa
we can also see other examples right who
are these guys blue and yellow right and
these three people here they look like
they're aliens from another world right
no i'm just kidding they're wearing some
kind of thing over their head they're
from sweden of course that's the swedish
flag so these are swedish fans again
probably soccer fans
who are cheering for their team look at
this guy he really he really went all
out painting his his whole almost his
whole body for uh for the game
this kid where is this kid from you can
see the flag of america the stars and
the stripes so he's an american fan and
these people over here where are they
from well we know this red cross we've
seen it so many times before
that of course is the symbol for
switzerland so we can see fans from
different countries will go crazy kind
of they'll do
very impressive or very unusual things
to show their support for their home
team for their home team or whatever
team they're favorite of now of course
these are
international sporting events within the
nation inside of america for example
people won't dress their won't paint the
american flag on their bodies because
everybody's american but like the
chicago if somebody's from chicago and
somebody's from new york they'll wear
the colors or paint their their bodies
in the colors of their
home or city team
okay and they will do that or they're
aware of the jerseys the famous
jerseys jersey is the sports shirt that
the athlete wears with the number on the
back of their favorite player on that
team and that's what fans will do
they'll show their support okay well
before we go into the reading of course
we need to learn some vocabulary so
let's take a look at some vocabulary
having to do with supporting your
favorite team our first word is of
course
a group of people working together look
at these big guys here they're very big
aren't they they look strong they look
tough this of course is a football team
when i say football i mean american
football some of course europeans say
football is soccer they don't use the
word soccer but in america if you say
football you're talking about this
you're not talking about soccer you're
talking about wearing the helmet the
football throwing it it's a different
sport but anyway
whether it's football soccer or european
football what do you have you have a
group of people working together of
course we say that's a team and we
talked about that before you will
support your favorite team
next word beyond at a greater point so
if you're here and you want to go beyond
you want to go further down the road
the word of course is further you want
to go beyond you want to go
at a greater point than where you are
now
of course further doesn't just mean
distance it can also mean you know if
you want to uh improve your studies you
want to prove something further right or
you you have are are there any further
questions is another a very common
expression are there more questions are
there questions beyond right now that we
can explore these different areas so in
some cases we have different expressions
with further are there any further
questions
we have to go a little further okay of
course we can get confused with farther
if you say farther a are th er you're
only talking about distance farther we
have much farther to go today
okay
number three
a person who supports a team or a person
we talked about that right these people
who are dressed in different colors in
their team uh these people this is like
i said before this is inside america
they're not they're not dressed in the
national flag of america they're dressed
in the colors of their team probably
their college team and of course they're
called fans of course that's it right
here fan a fan is a person who is
supporting their team now you can have a
super fan
super fans most people are normal fans
right they cheer for their team they go
out but super fans they really go crazy
okay
okay number four a small tasty meal so
sometimes between breakfast and lunch
you get hungry
especially between lunch and dinner you
might get hungry what do you want you
want to eat a snack a snack
please remember that
snack is countable let's have a snack
not let's have snack no let's have a
snack did you have a snack
uh this afternoon okay what do you want
to have for a snack okay so snack is
countable in this case we say it's like
it's but even though if you have like
many pieces of fruit and maybe a candy
bar you call it all a snack so a snack
is kind of like the entire thing that
you eat
during that short time that's a snack
but usually it's just one thing like a
candy bar or a piece of fruit okay
number five to help or to hold up now if
you help somebody or if you're holding
something up what are you doing you are
supporting you're supporting that this
is what fans do fans support their teams
but you can also use support in many
different uh
ideas for example if a house is built on
a hill you might have like pillars
supporting the house right it just means
to hold something up so support can be
used in different ideas in this case
though we're talking about supporting a
team right you're showing your um your
energy or your support for that team
number six very serious and extreme if
something's very serious very extreme we
say it is intense sometimes of course at
the international level at the world cup
level soccer players are the best in the
world their play is very intense they're
very serious about their sport
and sometimes they do some extreme moves
right like maybe they kick backwards
right the goal is behind them they kick
and the ball goes behind them into the
gold that is extreme that's very intense
and of course as fans we like to see
those intense moments that's what makes
the game very exciting
seven having a lot of energy so somebody
has a lot of energy we say they're
energetic that's very easy right energy
is the noun energetic is the adjective
he has a lot of energy he is
energetic
okay so that would be the adjective for
energy
eight
to quit or to stop trying okay if
somebody stops trying like
they're boxing and somebody falls down
they can't get up they say i've had
enough what do they do they give up
sometimes when kids fight they shouldn't
fight really but sometimes you'll see
the kids will hold the other kid on the
ground say do you give up or usually
brothers when they're fighting right one
one brother say will you give up you
know stop fighting right let's stop
fighting do you but they want the other
person to give up
or sometimes in a video game you say oh
it's hopeless i don't want to play to
the end because i know i can't win so i
give up that means to quit or to stop
trying i give up or do you give up okay
number nine an entertaining and
difficult action what is an entertaining
entertaining and difficult action we can
say a trick
a trick is something that magicians this
is a magic trick right we usually think
of trick in terms of magic
some famous magicians
will do tricks that are difficult
to do but they're very entertaining it's
also difficult to figure out how did he
do that right and that is a trick
number ten
what the heck is that okay that's not a
real animal right it's an animal a
personality that is a symbol of a team
so somebody who's a symbol of a team you
have different symbols for different
teams in korea right
but we call those things mascot a
mascot so different teams will have
different
uh
animals or like a person in a funny
costume and they are the mascot so
usually it's an animal like bears or
eagles dolphins
something like that they will be the
mascot for the team
the next one number 11 is to walk over
violently of course this is acting right
here she's walking over this guy
violently she's trampling this guy but
usually when you think about this word
trample it's not just one person it's
like a crowd of people many people and
maybe they're scared or maybe they're
excited or they're very enthusiastic and
they don't
think about safety right they're just
running as a group and sometimes this
can be very dangerous especially in
crowded or narrow areas where many
people are moving and somebody falls
down
other people might not even know that
person is there because there's so many
people they will trample the person
who's on the ground so usually this is
not you know it's usually many people
walking over another person or it
doesn't even have to be a person you can
trample the ground if there's grass and
many people trample the grass then they
walk over the grass maybe they ruin the
grass so you trample in an area okay
12. a sweet drink with bubbles in it a
sweet drink with bubbles in it you're
thinking bubble tea well we think about
soda the bubbles are a little uh
gas little
bubbles of gas of course when you pour
coca-cola or cider
you say cider in korea in in america
we'd say sprite or we would say a 7-up
you have the carbonation the little
bubbles that rise
in the drink and that's a
sweet drink with bubbles in it not
bubble tea
you could say that but in this case
we're talking about soda
three
ink that is under the skin forever so
somebody will have uh you know an artist
will will draw or put this ink
under the skin of a person it's kind of
painful to do and once it's there it's
there forever you can't change it so
later on oh i don't like it sorry
what are you gonna do it's there and
it's very painful to get it to get it
off so be very careful if you do this
but they're calling it a tattoo
tattoo
tattoo isn't an english word by the way
it comes from the south pacific when the
english sailors
were in that area and they saw the
natives they had tattoos and that's what
they called it in on those islands they
said tattoo so the english sailors
brought that word back to england with
them and it became part of the english
language tattoo very interesting anyway
so that's a tattoo
14
being focused and trying hard to do
something being focused on something
very trying very hard to do it it means
you are dedicated you are dedicated you
are focused on your task so you are very
dedicated in doing your task now
dedicated is an adjective the noun of
course is dedication
so he has dedication he is
dedicated
he has dedication he is dedicated okay
next one 15. whoa this is very dangerous
right
bull fighting to move suddenly and
powerfully in one direction to move
suddenly and powerfully in one direction
what do bulls do
bulls charge right they suddenly start
running towards something and a bull is
very powerful it's charging
so it's not just bulls horses can charge
people can charge teams can charge a
crowd of people can charge just means
moving quickly and powerfully in one
direction
sixteen to cover with colored liquid of
course there's many forms or many ways
to do this what is this guy doing of
course he is painting a house but of
course we can also think about artists
like rembrandt or monet right
they are using paint to paint beautiful
pictures so to cover with colored liquid
whether it's very simple like painting a
house or painting a masterpiece like the
mona lisa right uh you're painting is
just to paint
okay well that's the words let's take a
look at the
exercises okay
the first one here we need to fill in
the blanks for all of these the first
one is our soccer beep isn't very good
we need practice so our soccer what
we talk about a group of people who play
soccer they're not very good we need to
practice so our soccer class our soccer
team our soccer fan or our soccer group
if you look at three of these if you
look at a
b and d
those are all about a group of people c
is about one person our soccer fan isn't
very good that sounds strange our soccer
fan is strange so let's get rid of c
we have a b and d
those are all talking about a group of
people
but what's the most common way to
describe a group of people who play
sports do we say a soccer class no a
class is for studying do we say a soccer
group
that's close but it's not that common to
say a soccer group it's much more common
to say soccer team and that's the answer
our soccer team isn't very good we need
practice so team is the best remember a
b and d are all a group of people but b
is the best answer because it's the most
common way to describe a group of people
who play a sport together
okay number
three we're skipping two
that storm was really what
that storm was really beep
it almost knocked that tree over so a
storm that is very strong it almost
knocks a tree is strong but a storm
comes along and tries almost knocks the
tree down what is it that storm was
really brief intense upset or heavy
which one sounds the best storm was
brief that means very quick so that's
not right
the storm was very intense
intense remember is
very focused
and very strong in some area and extreme
right so if a storm is extreme or
focused on some area it is intense and
it's very strong the storm was upset
that doesn't make sense because storms
don't have feelings
oh that storm looks angry oh that storm
looks happy well that's crazy okay and
heavy we don't say storms are heavy
that's it's a strange
relationship we don't say that we say
storms are intense or fierce or strong
or dangerous but intense is a very good
word to use to describe a storm
okay
number five i know i just ate supper but
i really want a what
so what do you usually eat after supper
after supper what do you normally eat
you want something sweet usually what
after i eat supper i want something
sweet after supper so
i know i just ate supper but what do i
want you want what a desert b snack c
fork d
breakfast be careful here with a
desert
okay there's two words that are very
similar desert and the other word is
dessert
now be very careful if this word had two
s's
it would be correct because that's
common after dinner i always want to
have a little bit of dessert like
something sweet piece of cake maybe a
cookie some candy you know just to have
after dinner and that's very common
to have dessert after dinner but desert
with 1s is like the sahara desert right
very dry no trees no water so of course
you don't eat the sahara desert after
dinner that's crazy right so desert be
careful desert or dessert right
this is desert not dessert so it doesn't
fit
okay
bee snack what is dessert dessert is
like a snack right so that is an that is
the answer right there a snack b
a fork i really want a fork
that doesn't make sense i want breakfast
after you ate supper no you have to
sleep first next morning then you have
breakfast the best answer here is snack
because i know i just ate supper i just
ate supper i know that
but i really want a snack i want
something more to eat
now usually after
supper after dinner by the way
americans say dinner
and supper are the same it's the meal
you have in the evening after that we
usually have dessert dessert is only
after supper we don't have dessert after
lunch you don't have dessert after
breakfast
after breakfast after lunch you have a
snack but you can also have a snack
after dinner after dinner you can have
dessert or you could also call it a
snack it doesn't matter okay anyway
that's kind of complicated
number seven
my dad always beat me in school what
does your dad always do
with you in school
does he clean you in school i hope not
the other kids
right strange dad okay don't do that
my dad always packs me in school puts
you in a suitcase no that's crazy
my dad always supports me in school he
supports me in school aha that's
interesting or my dad always brings me
in school
supports sounds correct what about
brings can we say my dad always brings
me in school no because you use brings
brings you
to school so the correct answer is
support my dad always supports me in
school you support someone in something
i support him in his efforts i support
him in his uh
field or in his job but you bring
somebody to a place so support is the
correct answer here okay well let's take

person and even if they do something

hurt you a little bit but you say no i
forgive them and i will continue to help

for the things that you throw away from

somebody and look up to that person what
are you doing you respect that person
okay respect can be a verb
it can also be a noun that's a v sorry
about that that's a v so verb and noun
you can have respect for someone
and you can respect someone so as a verb
i respect you
as a noun i have respect for you okay so
respect can be a verb or a noun next one
to try oh whoa this is kind of cool
look at that
right he's what is this cat doing and
this cat is like oh watch out this cat
is trying to harm of course they're just

to not pay attention to she looks upset
right she's not happy with him right and
he's sorry he's like saying i'm sorry
but she's not happy she doesn't want to
talk to him what is she doing she is
ignoring him to ignore somebody
sometimes when you're angry with your
friends you ignore them right because
you're angry but be patient right be
patient listen to them try to forgive
them okay what did they do
but by the way this is interesting she
turned
her
back
on so the expression is turn someone's
back on another person so she turned her
back on
him that's a good expression to use in
fact if you watch the lion king it's
kind of an old movie but it's a great
movie there's a good scene in there
where scar the evil lion
walks away from mufasa right and mufasa
says don't turn your back on me right
and that's a very interesting
expression right don't turn your back on
me don't ignore me so it's a good idiom
okay next one
whoa this guy looks really weird looks
strange he's mad another word for mad is
angry right we already talked about that
right when i was talking about patience
right it's very easy to get very angry
at something but another word for angry
is mad but be careful americans say mad
is the same as angry that's american
american english if you're british
usually british people will say mad is
the same as crazy right
right
crazy oh he's mad so a british person if
a british person says oh he's mad it
means he's crazy but if an american
person say says he's mad it means he's
angry okay so be careful there's
difference between american english and
british english and several several ways
and this is one of them
okay
a room with a toilet sink and usually a
shower or bath okay of course you go to
this place every morning right you you
you go poo there you pee there okay but

okay let's talk about the review okay
let's see how well we remember these
words
our instructions are choose the word
that best completes the sentence here
are our words down here and here are
blanks and you'll notice we're skipping
all the even numbers so we're just going
to do one three five seven okay so we'll
just do four okay so number one john is
a beep friend he would never lie to me
so think about that word again
somebody who is honest
and trustworthy you can depend on them
what word did we learn that means that
okay loyal bad basic or new well if you
remember we said loyal loyal friend is a
person who never lies to you it's
somebody who
you can trust and who is always honest
to you lie is the opposite of honest
right so if somebody is loyal to you
they are always honest with you they're
loyal they won't lie to you they won't
do something to hurt you okay they are
loyal
okay number three the teacher will beep
us with a pizza party but only if we do
well on the test so
we've got a couple things here right we
have one thing is pizza party a pizza
party that's a great thing right yay
we're very happy to get a pizza party
that's something very good but we only
get it if
if
what we do well on the test
if we
do a good job on the test the teacher
will do something right what word did we
learn that means something like that the
teacher will give us a gift if we do a
good job what word means that a train
b reward
c
inform and d let and of course they're
all verbs because only a verb will fit
in here after will so train reward
inform or let of course you remember the
word is reward the teacher will reward
us because if we do a good job we do
well on the test the teacher will reward
us what is the reward a pizza party yay
not trained not informed not let those
don't fit the best word is reward okay
next one number five
fighting and lying are bad what okay now
think about it uh the rules at school
think about the rules at school or the
rules at your home are you allowed to
fight and to lie at home no that's
against the rules at home in school are
you allowed to fight your classmates or
lie to your teacher no that's against
the rules of the school so behavior that
is against the rules of something okay i
just said the answer there right is like
fighting and lying is it a patience b
problem c behavior or d tricks right i
just said behavior right fighting and
lying are bad behavior it's against the
rules of a certain place that's what we
talked about before
it's not bad patience that doesn't make
sense bad problem fighting and lying are
bad problems
right you could do that but remember you
have to have s at the end of that
fighting and lying are bad tricks that's
isang hail it's best to say fighting and
lying or bad behavior that's the best
answer there
okay number seven
the new team beep is very strong
okay so the new team what remember on a
team there are many people right and who
are those people a lot of those people
are followers but there's one person in
that group who's going to do what
a homework b trick c treat or d leader
okay so think about that which word
makes sense here the new team homework
doesn't make sense the new team trick
that doesn't fit the new team treat
that doesn't make any sense at all the
new team leader ah that's the only one
that makes sense
right so that must be the answer the new
team leader
is very strong right so the leader of
the team is a strong person so that team
is probably also pretty strong you got
to be careful
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
section of the lesson
let's take a short break and go to the
reading
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading

with animals but we'll not just look at
pets in the reading passage they'll also
mention some other ways that human
beings have lived with animals a long
time ago and through history but just
briefly but first of course before we do
any reading we should study some
vocabulary first are you ready let's
begin with our first word well these

entertainment okay so entertainment has
many different forms or there's many
types of entertainment
okay next word

death there is a death in the family is
a common expression there was a death

somebody in the family died grandfather
grandmother father mother hopefully not
child right but there was a death in the
family
there was a death of a police officer
and this
is the funeral
a funeral
is to mark the death of a person a
funeral okay
next one

here is a mechanic it's his job to make
sure that this car keeps on working
his job is to maintain
maintain

maintain the vehicle make sure that it
keeps working and not just that it keeps

and that is the job of a
mechanic
but
not just mechanics
everybody

keep your body working well get enough
sleep right eat the proper foods
maintain your health okay so it's not
just mechanics who maintain things

don't
ignore the things that you have maintain
them make sure they keep working well

like he is suffering okay but you can
also of course just use suffer she
suffers from
right she suffers from the flu she
suffers from a breakup her boyfriend
broke up with her so she suffers from
that okay but usually we say she is
suffering we don't say why okay okay
number five
to teach new information to teach new
information is to educate somebody right
now you are being educated i'm teaching
you about english and we're going over
vocabulary so right now i am educating
you when you go to school
you are being educated by your teachers
and your textbooks
when you go to the library and you read
a book you're being educated it's very
important to continue to be educated
throughout our lives even after you
finish school read books that you're
interested in and subjects that you're
interested in watch uh documentaries on
television or watch
movies about history and always don't
give up being educated right education
is very important
six
more than what is useful or needed more
than what is useful or needed is
extra if you have something that you
don't need right you don't need it
it's more than what is useful you don't
need it for uh for using it it's not
it's not something that you that you
need to use it's just something extra
right something above and
beyond what you need or what is useful
it's extra usually it's a bonus we think
of it in in the terms of positive
thinking right so dessert after dinner
is something extra for you to eat you
don't need it maybe it's not useful but
you like it right that's extra okay
sometimes your mom will put something
extra in your lunch when you go to
school or you'll get something extra
from your friends if they give you
something you don't need it maybe it's
not useful but it's something that you
like it's extra
seven
a place to keep animals for people to
see so these people are visiting what
they're visiting the zoo the giraffe
lives in the zoo well this giraffe lives
in the zoo most giraffes live in the
wild right but in some many cities there
are zoos where people can go and they
can see animals these animals are not
tame they're not pets
they're they're kind of wild animals
even though they don't live in nature
they live in a a
place that's built by human beings
they are in a zoo but they are not tame
you have to be careful when approaching
these animals because they're maybe not
used to being around human beings
okay we say that of course that's a zoo
i forget the the word zoo when you say
this word pronunciation
z
z
zoo
zoo not jew
zoo z you got some vibration so make
your mouth wide like that and make your
tongue vibrate zoo
and you got it zoo
okay next one whoa this kid's really
smart right
unique and different right most kids
most children do not
write these types of diagrams you have
to be very smart and very intelligent to
be able to do this we say
this person is special some kids some
young people are very smart they're like
geniuses and they are able to do these
types of things at an early age maybe
even better than people who are a lot
older than them some of them are a lot
smarter than their teachers in school
they are special kids and they should
have special education okay next one
nine wow very nice and peaceful very
beautiful
scene
having a lot of water in the air now
having a lot of water in the air it's
kind of hard to show a picture of that
but basically if you're at the beach you
notice you're next to the ocean it's
very hot uh when it's hot a lot of the
water
comes into the air right and in korean
you say
right
in english we say it's human during the
summer time in korea it's very humid
isn't it
and you sweat a lot uh in this in the
winter time it's dry so the opposite of
humid the opposite pandero is dry it's
dry in the winter but humid in the
summer humid means it has a lot of water
in the air
next one
people who make sure we follow the laws
who are people that make sure we follow
the laws we call these people police
this person is a police man but there
are also police women
okay if you just want to make you talk
about police you can just say police you
know it doesn't mean man or woman it's
just the police and usually we say the
police force it's a group of people men
and women who
make sure we follow the laws they
enforce the law if he is breaking the
law by speeding going too fast or if he
doesn't stop at the stoplight or stop
sign
then
this person will write a ticket making
sure that he follows the law next time
11. oh we have a plan they're playing
doctor right he's going to be the doctor
for his younger brother looks like what
a thing does or is used for but what a
thing does or is used for we call that a
role right
so what is the role of the things that
you use for example the mask what's the
role of the mask the role of the mask or
the function of the mask is to prevent
disease from transferring from one
person to another so what the thing does
or what it is used for we can say what's
its role you could also say what is it
what is its function
what is its function or what is it used
for what is it used for
what's its role okay oh that was fast
these kids have you ever done this what
are they doing there they have pillows
and they're fighting with each other to
try to beat somebody you fight them of
course a pillow fight
is
very common
among brothers and sisters and friends
right hey you're fighting somebody but
you don't mean to hurt them you're just
having fun you're trying to beat the
other person and you're fighting them
of course we also fight people in video
games try don't fight people physically
that's not good behavior but you're
trying to beat the other person now
fight isn't irregular verb it has
different forms when we use it in past
tense so we say fight
fought
fought
fight fought fought okay that's the uh
different verb forms depending on the
verb tense that you're using present or
past tense with a simple past or past
perfect
okay next one 13 oh
this house looks terrible right it's
leaning to one side situation or
environment the condition
of this house is very bad in fact this
house should be torn down it's not safe
the condition is
unsafe what is the condition of this
house dangerous unsafe it should be torn
down and a new house should be built a
new house the condition is very good and
the condition is safe
okay so the situation environment is
like the condition
okay next one made of hardened sand and
stone made of hardened sand and stone
what is this this is concrete okay so
you see this truck sometimes you see
these trucks at
kong su jung kong jung sites right
and that's construction site and they
use concrete to build buildings or other
types of things roads
walls
concrete is used for a lot of different
things and they use sand and stone
crushed up stone water also
and they can make concrete okay made of
hardened sand and stone concrete this
isn't hard this is wet but after it
dries it becomes hard and it's a very
strong building material
okay number 15
a huge field with grass and few trees so
a huge field
lots of grass a few trees here and there
we call this place a plane a plane
and if you talk about the planes usually
people say the planes like if they say
the great plains the great plains is a
is an area designated in the middle of
america it involves states like texas
oklahoma nebraska
and higher up the dakotas
these states
they're not a lot of trees it's just
very flat and lots of grass and there's
a lot of farmland there now a long time
ago it's just grass and buffalo would
run up and down this area and the
indians would hunt the buffalo those are
the great plains
okay so plain a very flat area huge
field you can see from miles and miles
and miles it takes days to go across the
great plains
okay last word a deep hole if you have a
deep hole like this this looks like a
mining operation but a deep hole we call
it a pit i used to work for a mining
company in america i was in the human
resources department at a large mining
company and that's what we call we call
it the pit we say the north pit the
south pit right so a pit is a deep hole
but pit doesn't just mean mining it can
be a natural
pit for example sometimes you hear on
the news where the ground just opens up
and they call that a sinkhole but it's
also you can also say it's a pit it's
just a deep hole in the ground it's a
pit
okay that's our words let's go over the
words how well do we remember these
words let's do some exercises
number one i enjoy movies they are great
beep
and then we have the words here so we
have a waste be audience c entertainment
d
people
what do we say about this word we said
that
something that you do
for fun
right
like a movie it could be playing a video
game it could be playing soccer there's
many forms of it what is it of course we
talked about entertainment i enjoy
movies they are great entertainment not
waste that doesn't make sense not
audience that doesn't make sense and not
people
movies are not people that's weird
movies are a form of entertainment there
are many types of entertainment there
are many forms of entertainment movies
are one type of entertainment
okay skipping number two going to three
you can see monkeys in cages at the what
where can you go and see animals in
cages hopefully not in cages that's not
very nice it's not very good hopefully
they're in open areas but sometimes
they're in large cages okay where do you
see them and the planes in the jungle at
the zoo or in the at the environment
right notice we say at
that's important too because we don't
say at the planes we say on the planes
we don't say at the jungle we say in the
jungle let me write this down for you
on
the planes
in the oops in the jungle
at the zoo
and in
the environment so really we see at here
at is here so that kind of gives us the
idea anyway right you can see monkeys in
cages at the zoo we say at the zoo we
don't you can say in the zoo but
it's more common to say at the zoo but
we don't say at the planes we say on the
planes we don't say at the jungle we say
in the jungle and environment is usually
common to say in the environment in an
environment so
just looking at the preposition zoo is
the only one that we have to choose so
zoo is the answer but zoo is also the
only one that makes sense you don't see
monkeys in cages on the plains or in the
jungle the jungle is a natural
environment you don't have cages in the
jungle where monkeys live that's crazy
and in the enviro in the environment
that doesn't fit well with the sentence
anyway the best answer is zoo even if we
don't worry about the preposition
okay next one number five
i was beep at a good school
what
are what is done to you at a school not
nothing bad that sounds about what it's
done to you at a school but in a
positive sense
what happens to you at school right are
you educated are you entertained are you
kept are you treated well you could be
all four of those things but one of
those is the best choice i was educated
at a good school
hopefully you are if it's a good school
you will get a good education so you
will be educated at a good school i was
educated at a good school you could say
i was entertained at a good school but
the purpose for going to school is not
to be entertained the purpose for going
to school is to be educated so that's
not a very good fit
i was kept at a good school this sounds
like you were kept a prisoner at a good
school that sounds a little strange it's
possible grammatically but it sounds
strange i was treated at a good school
and that sounds odd too because that
doesn't say anything you were treated at
a good school
usually we have to say i was treated
well or was treated poorly
right how were you treated if you just
say i was treated at a good school that
doesn't say anything
what does it say and so it doesn't fit
the best answer is educated i was
educated at a good school it means i got
a good education
seven my dog is beep he has two
different colored eyes well that's
strange if your dog has one blue eye and
one brown eye that's kind of strange
right so would you say your dog is poor
your dog is special your dog is small or
your dog is old okay well strange can be
unusual right it can be uh
different it can be
special not ordinary right so the only
one is that fits is special pore doesn't
fit my dog is poor doesn't have any
money dogs don't care about that
my dog is small okay your dog is small
but why would you say he has two
different colored eyes that's not an
example of being small
my dog is old okay well he's old but why
would you say his two different colored
eyes having two different colored eyes
is not an example of being old
but
having two different colored eyes is an
example of being special so make sure
that this adjective fits the explanation
or the example right if this example
does not fit
the adjective
it's not a good match it's not a good
connection so special is the best choice
here because you're saying the first
sentence and then you're giving an
example of that okay so always make sure
you have that connection when you're
filling in exercises like this
okay that wraps up the vocabulary
section now let's take a short break and
go into the reading part let's take a
break
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary i'm your host brian
stewart we're going over the same topic
we're talking about caring for animals
but in this lesson lesson 9 we're going
to focus on who helps sick or injured
pets the title of course is a healthy
pet is a happy pet so if your pet is not
healthy
what happens who helps that pet who
helps a sick or injured pet well that's
what we're going to read about in
today's lesson but as usual let's learn
some vocabulary first now our first word
is uh oh
here we have a problem right
hurt having a cut or other injury this
poor baseball player looks to be injured
right maybe they got hit by the ball or
they twisted their leg or something
happened or another player ran into that
person
so what do we call a person who becomes
injured
while
playing or working or doing whatever
right
you could be walking to school and you
can become injured right so if you hurt
yourself or you get hurt somebody else
hurts you and you have a cut or you have
a bruise there are many types of
injuries right
many types of injuries but you are
injured part of your body is damaged
that means injured now be careful
because injured doesn't mean the same as
sick
if you're sick that means you have a
virus or some kind of disease right
that's affecting your body and you don't
feel right if you're injured there's
been some kind of physical damage to
your body okay so
injury and sickness are different
remember that okay and that's how in the
title we had to say who helps sick or
injured animals because they're
different a sick animal is not the same
as an injured animal it's a different
type of problem when you're sick it's a
different problem than if you're injured
okay so those are two different
conditions
okay next one
a medicine that help that keeps you from
getting sick now
right it's terrible and probably you
were in this situation before but it's
very important that you go to the doctor
and the doctor gives you medicine
usually a shot right that helps you
from becoming sick later everybody has
it right now we call these things a
vaccine
it's a it's a medicine
that you get when you're young to
prevent you from getting sick later some
people still have the bump on their arm
from where they got a shot when they
were young usually it's for smallpox or
some other disease like that like polio
and this is a vaccine of course we live
in a very
convenient age the modern age that we
live in
is very convenient we don't think about
it but medicine has developed so we can
take these vaccines when we're young we
don't have to worry about these diseases
a hundred years ago
200 years ago people died
by the thousands by the millions from
diseases that we don't worry about today
because of vaccines so yes it hurts but
it's important to get a vaccine people
will say shot have you gotten your shots
yet or i need to get a shot so to get a
shot
get
a
shot
because it's like a shot that you get in
your arm and that's usually a vaccine
for something that will prevent you from
getting sick nowadays we hear a lot
about the flu shot the flu shot it's a
vaccine to prevent you from getting the
flu and people will take it every year
before winter starts to protect them
from the flu
okay next one three sharing equally with
others so these two artists or producers
or i'm not sure what's going on here
they're sharing their award equally what
they have that award what do they have
they have it in
common if you have something in common
with somebody that means you share that
condition or that attribute right if you
and your mother are very similar
in appearance right your appearance you
share your appearance in common if you
and your father have the same sense of
humor right you share that same sense of
humor then you have a sense of humor in
common
it means you have something similar to
somebody else
okay next one number four whoa that's
kind of a funny looking picture right
here's a little boy and he's meeting his
younger brother or sister but not yet
his younger brother sister is still in
his mommy's belly right
having a baby growing inside one so mom
here what can we say about mom she has a
baby inside of her
womb inside of her belly right
it's she is pregnant so she is pregnant
sometimes people say she's with child
but she is pregnant okay
next one difficult something that is
very difficult to do like climb
uh the rocks without a shirt on that's
that's tough okay i'm just kidding about
without the shirt on it's it's tough
even with a shirt on but
it's difficult it's tough right so
they're synonyms basically if you say
something is very difficult you can say
oh it's very tough right for example if
you have a difficult test you can say
whoa that test was very tough it was a
tough test it was a difficult test
right it was tough or it was difficult
next one
when a doctor cuts you open
and fixes you that's what's going on
here and this is
this is something that's extreme right
thankfully it's not very common but
sometimes some people maybe us maybe you
maybe me might have a situation where
the doctor needs to cut actually cut
open our body and fix something inside
to help cure us
what do we call that procedure we say it
is surgery okay now the verb that we
usually use with surgery is perform
the doctor will perform surgery
uh or i need to another way that we
call this is operation
an operation
i need to have
an operation so if i say if i'm in the
hospital and i say i have to have an
operation that means the doctor will
perform surgery on me right the doctor
performs surgery on me
i need to have an operation those are
the common ways that we talk about this
situation
also surgery can be used as an adjective
for example the surgery room uh
this is the surgery preparation room or
this is the surgery area of the hospital
so sometimes surgery can also be an
adjective not just a noun okay but
remember when it is a noun we usually
use say perform surgery and we also say
i need to have an operation or you need
an operation that's the same idea okay
so a couple of common expressions for
that situation next one
a visit to the doctor to check your
health now you should do this every year
some people go every six months right
maybe when they're younger it's
important to do that but you need to
regularly go to the doctor to check your
health and that's part of the word right
check up because the doctor needs to
check on you
you need to check to make sure you're
not sick
it's called a checkup and usually people
go once a year for their annual checkup
okay number eight
a person who treats people for
sicknesses and injuries
when you go to the doctor to check for
sicknesses or if you have an injury
who do you go to what do you call that
person i think i just said it doctor
right this person this lady she is a
doctor right and there are many
different types of doctors right some
doctors will only specialize in like the
nose the throat and the ears
some doctors will only specialize in
treating children some doctors will only
specialize in fixing broken bones right
there are many different types of
doctors
okay number nine
happening at the same time every time so
this is like uh
something that happens every time if you
wind this up this is what musicians
usually use right it goes tick tick tick
tick
every time at a certain time what do we
say it's regular it's regular clocks are
regular they
show us the time
all the time every time right and one
hour they go around the clock
regularly or clocks are very regular we
can depend on them
sometimes we have habits that are
regular for example every morning you
get up you take a shower you brush your
teeth or you eat breakfast then you
brush your teeth that's your regular
morning routine that's regular if you do
something different that's unusual right
that would be the opposite but happening
at the same time every time that's
regular
okay next one
mo right we have a couple of cows here a
baby cow right animals will have
different names
for
different sexes right male or female
they'll also have different names for
their age right we we don't really say
we can't say baby cow but you could also
say calf calf is more specific right a
baby horse you could say it's a baby
horse or you could say it's a cult
right you could say a baby dog or you
can say
puppy right isn't it interesting in
english
i don't know if it's the same in korean
but in english we have all these special
words for baby animals and they're
they're usually a lot different right
there's also cub right for
bears and lions and tigers have cubs
dogs have puppies
horses have colts cows have calves oh so
many words to remember okay but it's
very interesting okay next one
oh what's wrong with him he had a bad
haircut right he should sue his barber
no i'm just kidding he wanted it that
way obviously you have to you have to
specifically ask for this type of
haircut okay strange and unusual i'm
making a comment about it because it's
not normal to see somebody with a
haircut like this it is yeah you could
say weird okay he's strange he's unusual
you could also say
unique
now it's interesting because if we say
weird weird has a little bit of a
negative
feeling to it you say it's weird it's
like oh that's weird but if you say it's
unique that can have a little bit of a
positive feeling about it so it depends
on how you look at the situation if you
look at him and says wow that's cool
he's unique or you can look at him and
say oh that's not good it's weird okay
so be careful using weird because weird
usually means you have a negative
feeling about something or unique
can be if you have a positive feeling
about something but it's strange it's
unusual then say oh that's unique okay
so that's more polite or better feeling
associated with unique than weird okay
so that's interesting about these words
here
next a container for carrying something
this is a container for carrying
something if you have to carry your pet
for example you will carry your pet in a
carrier usually we only use this word
though it's usually used for
transporting animals a carrier if you
have a container for carrying your books
you don't call it a carrier you call it
a backpack if you have a container for
carrying your food to a school or to
your office we don't really call it a
carrier you could but it's a little
strange we just say it's a food
container or if you use the brand name
it's tupperware right
so we
carrier is usually specifically used for
a container that carries animals for
transportation next one number 13 a
place where animals are raised for food
now a lot of people they don't know
where their food comes from they think
oh food comes from the supermarket but
that's not true where does the
supermarket get the food the supermarket
is not the original place where the food
comes from the food comes from animals a
lot of animals and also plants uh where
the animals are raised for food like for
example pork or uh beef sogogi right if
you want to have uh uh
uh sorry i bulgogi i had a
hard time just remembering that bulgogi
or duiji calabi right
that meat comes from where it comes from
a farm
okay we say it's a farm where animals
are raised for food okay sometimes
people will also call it a ranch but a
ranch has a little bit of a different
idea a ranch is much bigger than a farm
and a ranch is usually where you have a
lot of
cows or cattle that's usually where
cattle is
is uh is raised and it's usually very
big farms tend to be small and farms are
also places where they grow
plants like corn
wheat things like that but our ranches
where usually specifically for cows we
have very big
groups herds of of cattle okay so anyway
farm and ranch we usually we talk about
farm a place where animals are raised
for food okay next one
now she looks like she's doing yoga
right and she's stretching her body so
that her hands are pointing where
they're facing away from the front front
her fingers are pointing away from her
front they are pointing backward okay
now if you turn around right right now
i'm looking at you i'm looking at you in
the front but i can turn this way now
i'm looking backward okay it just means
facing away from the front
looking backward or stretching backward
okay
next one a doctor who cares for animals
now there's a very long word
veterinarian we'll see that word later
in the reading veterinarian but that's a
hindu word to pronounce so a lot of
people just say that so veterinarian
just say vet because it's a lot easier
and most people just say vet a vet is a
doctor who cares for animals but be
careful
because vet sometimes also can mean
something else that is completely
different a veteran
a veteran is a soldier who served in a
war or served for their country in the
military sometimes people will call
those people a vet too he's a vet he's
served in the iraq war they're not
talking about a person who cares for
animals okay so be careful that can mean
a former ex-soldier right a person who
used to be a soldier or it can be a
doctor who cares for animals so be
careful don't be confused if somebody
says vet you have to know the situation
what is the context of the situation
okay
last word
okay
a hard cover that goes over a part of
your body now unfortunately this girl
she doesn't seem to be upset about it
but she's been injured right she
probably broke or sprained her ankle or
her foot so she has to put something on
that part of her body to keep the bones
from moving you want to keep the bones
in the same position so they can heal
together
now when i first came to korea it was
konglish people called it gibs right
gipps but that's konglish the word is
cast
now i was very confused i was like why
do my students call this a gips
where does that come from well i learned
that this is made of the same material
that chalk white chalk in your classroom
is made of and that's gypsum
ah very interesting so
gibbs comes from the material that the
cast is made from right and so i don't
know where that started whether it comes
from japan or you know a lot of congress
comes from japan i don't know where that
came from but some somewhere people were
thinking okay well the cast is made of
gypsum so they just thought gipps and
they called it that well that's konglish
americans
don't have any idea about that it
confused me when i first heard it i'm
like where does that come from
we normally just say cast right and you
put a cast on it or you wear a cast just
like a shoe or a shirt you wear
a cast wear a cast okay or you could say
the doctor put a cast on my foot now
even though you wear it it's not like a
shoe you can't take it off and put it
back on right the doctor puts it on and
then six weeks later the doctor has to
cut it off right
so it's not normal piece of clothing but
we use the same verb wear a cast i have
to wear a cast for six months and don't
say this that's konglish okay let's
review how well do we remember these
words
let's go over the
comprehension questions here
just the same as usual we have a blank
we need to choose the best word to fill
in the blank number one smallpox i
talked about that before smallpox was a
disease a hundred years ago 200 years
ago terrible disease killed many many
people it was a sickness that is gone
now thanks to people getting what
remember i told you when you're young
it's important to get that medicine to
get a shot what's in the shot is it a
checkup is it a vaccine is it an injury
or is it a doctor well of course it's
not a doctor you can't put a person
inside that shot that's crazy it's not
an injury that doesn't make sense it's
not a checkup it's of course a vaccine
right
thanks to people getting the vaccine
smallpox is gone nobody ever gets
smallpox anymore because medicine has
advanced so much that we just get the
vaccine and the disease has died out in
human beings it's not there anymore okay
number two the pilot was beep badly when
his plane crashed think about that
somebody's flying a plane and they don't
land correctly the plane crashes well
what's going to happen
the pilot was what celebrated injured
pregnant or treated
you can't get pregnant from crashing
your plane that's crazy
okay
you're probably not going to be
celebrated with celebrated badly that
doesn't make any sense celebrated is a
good thing uh treated he was treated
badly when his plane crashed that's
possible actually right people said oh
you shouldn't have crashed a plane but
more logically he was injured badly
that makes more sense because of course
when you think about it if you crash a
plane or even if you crash a car or even
your bicycle you crash you could get
badly injured so be careful when you're
in a vehicle or riding your bike
you can become injured
badly when
your vehicle crashes whether it's a
plane it's a car or a bike be careful
and follow the safety
rules and regulations
okay number five skipping up to number
five i get along well with my girlfriend
do you have a girlfriend or boyfriend
okay do you get along well with that
person
we have a lot
what if you get along with your
girlfriend it doesn't have to be
girlfriend it could just be friend you
get along well with your friend
because we have a lot of what of
problems
we have a lot of boredom we have a lot
to forget
or we have a lot in common what makes
sense
if you have a lot of problems with your
girlfriend
you don't get along well maybe it's time
to break up and go find somebody else
who you don't have problems with
we have a lot of boredom
that doesn't make sense right that does
you get along with somebody because
you're both bored together that's ysung
hail
we have a lot to forget
strange too we have a lot in common ah
remember in common means you share
something with somebody else so if you
share something with somebody else you
can understand them better so if you
have a lot and we say a lot in common
that's a common expression we have a lot
in common
then
you get along with the other person if
you don't get along with somebody you
can say we have nothing
in common that's the pandiro that's the
opposite right so if you meet somebody
you think they could be my friend but
they're very different from you they
don't like the same things that you do
they don't like the same movies or the
same
music they don't like the same books
they don't like the same hobbies that
you do you're not going to be able to
spend a lot of time with them because
you don't like the things they do you
don't have anything in common you have
nothing in common but on the other
situation if you have many things in
common you have a lot in common you like
the same books you like the same hobbies
you like the same movies then you can
get along with that person well okay
number seven
i can't believe you're beep and you're
going to have twins have twins that
means that somebody is going to have
babies now remember what we talked about
what's that word if somebody has a baby
in their belly
what are they are they necessary are
they small are they slow or are they
pregnant well of course the only one
that makes sense is pregnant i can't
believe you're pregnant and you're gonna
have twins not just one baby but two
babies right at the same time you're
gonna have twins necessary doesn't make
sense i can't believe you're small
what does that mean how does that have
to do with twins and i can't believe
you're slow it's kind of funny too the
only one that makes sense is pregnant
okay well let's take a break now and
we'll come back and go over the reading
together
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary we're on unit 4 we're
talking about world connections
lesson 10 is talking about going places
how about you have you traveled in your
life or have you moved your house from
one place to another maybe you grew up
in one city and moved and lived in
another city
well we're going to focus on the history
of transportation right because human
beings have been around for a very long
time and human beings like to travel
right it's part of who we are okay so
that's what we're going to talk about in
this lesson but first let's learn some
vocabulary words the first word we're
going to go over wow this is very
exciting right it's going very fast of
course this is what kind of thing it's a
long vehicle a long it's very long
vehicle that travels on rails these are
rails what do we call that of course you
know it's called a train right korea has
a very good train system ktx right the
bullet train it's very fast you can go
from seoul to busan in three and a half
hours very good okay but that's a train
okay the second word here anything
anything that carries people over land
water or sea of course we can see a
plane here we talked about train but
we're talking about anything it could be
a plane a train a car a boat
all of these things what do we call
these things they carry people over land
water or sea carry people anywhere in
the world we call this system
transportation
long word so trans
poor
four syllables let's say it a little bit
more quickly though like a native
speaker
transportation
transportation
okay transportation okay that is
basically anything that carries people
from one place to another but
transportation is usually thought of as
a system right or uh a type of uh
vehicle right it's a type for example a
train is a type of transportation a
plane is a type of transportation so
when we talk about transportation we're
not talking about one vehicle or a
specific vehicle we're talking about
any all types of vehicles anything okay
but if you're going to talk about
specific type then say boat or car train
or plane but you could also
to use transportation you can say
transportation is very good in korea for
example the transportation system is
very good in korea okay next one
three whoa what's this this looks a
little strange but if you look carefully
and closely you get it pretty quickly of
course you find this in your car if your
family has a car of course probably do
you open the hood of the car and you can
see this this is what makes the car go
it's a machine that provides power it
provides power to your car right it's
called an engine but engines of course
are also in trains they're in planes and
they're in automobiles right planes
trains and automobiles boats all types
of transportation
not all types a bicycle is a type of
transportation but it doesn't have an
engine right so you think of the
powerful types of transportation they
have an engine but other types of
transportation that are slower we use
our our power human power or animal
power horses and carts right but most
modern transportation
uses an engine
okay next one well this is very
interesting it's very key upg
car right a very cute car
useful and sensible so this is a useful
car it's sensible because it doesn't
waste a lot of gas it only uses enough
gas that it needs so we say something is
practical it's practical it's enough to
get the job done we don't waste time we
don't waste money it's practical okay
useful and sensible
next one a great achievement something
that is a great achievement we say it is
a feat not your pal right
not feet f-e-e-t but feet
f-e-a-t pronunciation is the same as
feet right but
feet means achievement if you have done
something spectacular you have done
something great maybe you won an award
that was a great feat you accomplished
an impressive
feat f-e-a-t not
nam se right not not that okay not feet
okay next one
six to move through the sky on the wind
so birds do this some kinds of airplanes
do this
people can do this too if they have a
certain device
it's called a hang glider but anyway
when birds are doing this they're not
moving their wings they're just have
their wings out and the wind helps them
keep in the air and they're just
floating they're like floating around
we say they are soaring to soar some
types of airplanes right they don't have
an engine they go up in the air they're
being pulled up in the air by another
plane and then they're released and then
they just kind of glide down back to the
earth they're soaring through the air to
soar
a vehicle that travels through the air i
was talking about it already quite a lot
i've mentioned it already many times of
course it is an a plane or an aircraft
so remember we can say airplane or just
plane we can also say aircraft it's a
vehicle that travels through the air now
aircraft many different types of
aircraft right a hang glider
you can say is a type of aircraft but
it's not a plane
a hang glider right that's where the
people get in they just have a bar and
there's this big
wing above them and they just float they
soar through the air right that's a type
of aircraft but mostly we're talking
about planes
mostly when we talk about aircraft we're
talking about planes and of course
passenger planes fighter jet planes
small stunt planes
there's many different types of planes
okay
hot water in the air when you cook tea
when you cook tea when you make tea when
you make don't say cooked when you make
tea
of course you want the water to boil
right so hot water will come out in the
air once it's boiling and we call that
steam be careful right steam apa right
joshua be careful because steam can be
dangerous right of course in this
situation maybe not so dangerous but in
a factory or something be careful right
because there's a lot of steam there can
be a lot of steam
nine to make disappear and then appear
in a different place to make something
disappear and then disappear here and
then make it appear in another place so
basically i move it from here to there
very quickly this is not real we only
see this in science fiction movies
nowadays of course star trek was very
famous for their what teleporter
teleporter okay they could teleport
people uh from their ship to the planet
down below
okay so that's called teleport
that's not real it's only in our
imagination nobody can do this yet
people are trying to figure out how to
do it but it's not possible to do it now
okay teleport
okay
next one a vehicle that can travel into
space what is that of course you're very
excited about reading about these and
hearing about these astronauts will go
into space on these vehicles they are
also a type of aircraft but we call them
a rocket
rocket okay so a rocket is a type of
aircraft right we saw that word before
many types of aircraft mostly we talk
about planes but rocket is also another
type of aircraft but this one goes into
space
okay
remember i was talking to you about this
one before i wrote it on the
board board
a one or two person aircraft with no
engine
it is a hang glider i taught that to you
before this is a very interesting very
exciting aircraft right it's a little
dangerous right
if you do this you have to be an adult
to do this and you have to have a lot of
training to be able to do this but this
is very amazing isn't it it would be
really cool to be able to do this and
this is a one or two person two people
can sometimes fly in it there's no
engine you jump off a mountain and you
fly you soar through the air
next one a thing that spins and pulls
air or water so on older airplanes on
older airplanes there we have this this
is called a propeller
propeller propeller
propeller that might be a little
difficult to pronounce
pro
pel
er
propeller
and these are of course on older
airplanes right nowadays most airplanes
use jet engines
jets
most airplanes are jets nowadays
especially the big airplanes that you
travel to another country they use jets
but smaller airplanes and older
airplanes they'll use propellers
okay next one
a basic vehicle with four wheels right
before when i was talking about engines
right not all transportation has engines
there's no engine on this vehicle right
but what do we call this we call this a
carriage
carriage carriage now you may know about
carriages from fairy tales right when
you read the fairy tale about cinderella
right a carriage comes to take her to
the ball and then the carriage comes is
supposed to bring her back home before
it turns into the little mice and the
pumpkin right so we know about carriages
from fairy tales carriages were very
common hundreds of years ago before the
invention of the car rich people would
ride around in carriages
okay
a fuel that powers cars of course if you
are with your mom or dad you're driving
around they have to stop at a jew you
saw right a gas station once in a while
so a fuel that powers car is gas gas
station in korean you say juju soil
right but we say gas station in america
in england in britain they say petrol
petrol so british english they will say
i need some petrol for my car but
americans don't use the word petrol they
if you say petrol in america people will
know what you're talking about but they
hardly ever use that word so think well
that's kind of strange did you learn
english in britain right so most
americans will say just gas i need gas
for my car let's go to a gas station
british people say we need to get some
petrol let's go to a petrol station okay
so gas
next one
a large balloon filled with hot air that
carries people okay this is also very
exciting that would be fun to ride in
right
of course it's a safer than a hang
glider right you don't have to have as
much training you just have to be with a
person who knows what he's doing or
she's doing so what we call this we call
this a hot air balloon and of course we
see all the words there hot air balloon
right it's a big balloon not a balloon
that you hold in your hand at a birthday
party no this is really big and it uses
hot air to go up in the sky right so
it's a hot air balloon
okay last one
having to do with sunlight so these are
becoming more and more popular these
days right this is like future
technology maybe the future will depend
on this type of technology what are
these these are like panels
panel
right a panel is just a flat surface
right but these are what kinds of panel
they have to do with sunlight we call
them solar
panels but this word here is an
adjective and we use that word in front
of anything that uses sunlight solar
panel solar
car
solar uh whatever okay
this is an adjective that we use in
front of nouns to describe that they
have to do with sunlight or usually
nowadays that they get their energy from
the sun solar panel gets its energy from
the sun from sunlight
okay those are our words let's go over
the exercises for that vocabulary
the first problem here is after a hot
shower hot shower is good in the morning
on a winter day isn't it okay a hot
shower the bathroom air fills with what
so of course if it's winter you're
taking a hot shower in the morning or at
night before you go to bed well actually
that's
may make you go to sleep but anyway in
the bathroom you notice i can't see
right if you have glass you have to wipe
the glass why because the water is hot
it gets in the air and what do we call
that is it gas is it smoke is it steam
or is it soap
okay we might say oh it's smoke no it's
not smoke smoke is from a fire right
this is water water vapor it's not gas
it's not soap right be careful don't get
soap in your eyes what is it of course
we know it's steam right hot air
sorry water that gets very hot hot water
if it's very hot it will become steam
and of course when you're taking a hot
shower there's a lot of steam in the
bathroom if you go to a sauna there's a
lot of steam people like it it's healthy
for them okay
three a hammer is not very beep for
cooking food so we're talking about
something that is useful
or sensible to use for something else do
we use a hammer to cook food a hammer we
use to pound a nail into wood you don't
use a hammer for cooking food that's
crazy right
so how do we use that though as an
adjective a hammer is not very beep is
not
very what for cooking food
so it's not
a silly be practical c big d useless
remember the word not here
if we said a hammer is not very silly
you might choose silly because oh that's
silly to use a hammer for cooking food
but we're using not so not silly means
that it's okay
but that's not right a hammer is not
okay to use for cooking food so silly
doesn't work what about practical not
practical ah not practical practical
means useful sensible right a hammer is
not pro not practical it's not useful
it's not sensible so that's our answer b
is not big that doesn't
fit and useless remember not
not useless if we got rid of not we said
a hammer is useless for cooking food
that's okay if we said a hammer is silly
for cooking food that would be okay
but we're using not so the adjective has
to be appropriate not practical for
cooking food it's not useful okay
okay next one five we took the beep
it was faster than the car or bus and
cheaper than a plane
so that's interesting this uh problem
kind of eliminates
choices for you so you took something in
other words you took some type of
transportation we take transportation
you can take a plane you can take a boat
you can take a taxi you can take a car
or whatever so we take some type of
transportation
but what kind of transportation well we
know what it's not we know it's not a
car not a bus and we know it's not a
plane okay
but we also know a couple more clues it
was faster than faster than a car faster
than a bus
not faster than a plane just cheaper
than a plane interesting so those are
the clues not a car not a bus not a
plane faster than a car faster than a
bus and cheaper not as expensive as a
plane what could it be our choices are
horse rocket train or bicycle well let's
look at them a horse is a horse faster
than a car or a bus
no of course not cars are much faster
than horses they can go much longer
distances and much quicker so it's not a
horse
a rocket
okay faster than a car bus yeah a rocket
is faster than a car or bus is it
cheaper than a plane no rockets are
really really expensive okay you have to
be a millionaire to go into space on a
rocket if you're going to pay for it
okay what about a train a train is
faster than a car bus that's true it's
cheaper than a plane yeah train tickets
are usually a lot cheaper than plane
tickets that's our answer train we took
the train faster than a car bus and
cheaper than a plane it's not faster
than a plane it's just cheaper than a
plane
and bicycle we know bicycles not faster
than a car or bus so that's not the
answer either
okay number seven rockets are the
fastest beep in the world rockets are
the fastest what our choices are trains
b aircraft c flight d steam so right
away we see that flight doesn't work
because flight is not a type of vehicle
neither is steam steam is not a type of
vehicle that leaves us with trains or
aircrafts is a rocket a type of train
no it's not a type of train it's a type
of aircraft so rockets are the fastest
aircraft in the world remember i said
before aircraft there are many many
different types of aircraft planes hang
gliders and also rockets okay well that
wraps up the vocabulary section for this
unit let's take a short break we'll come
back and look at the reading don't go
away
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary are you interested in
continuing our subject here we're of
course on unit 4 we're talking about
world connections so it's very
interesting looking at different places
around the world and also thinking about
how people have traveled from place to
place in lesson 11 we're talking about a
quick bite to eat so we're not going to
be focusing on transportation we're
going to be talking about fast food
because of course in our lives as we're
very busy traveling from place to place
it's very easy to get food very quickly
and we're talking about fast food in
this section so that will be our reading
passage but again of course we need to
study the vocabulary that we will
encounter in the passage so let's begin
the first word on our list today is a
difficulty or an issue so if you have a
difficulty or if there's some issue that
you have to deal with we call that a
problem
problem now it's very interesting
because i'd like to point out something
problem
and issue have become
kind of
not interchangeable but
substituted in america many people will
say issue
instead of saying problem for example
why because problem is negative
issue sounds more neutral so for example
americans instead of saying do you have
a problem they will say is there an
issue with this because do you have a
problem is very direct and sounds
negative but if you change it and you
say is there an issue with this
whatever then that sounds more neutral
it doesn't sound as
rude and it doesn't sound as negative so
it's very interesting i've noticed over
maybe the last 10 or 20 years that
americans have stopped using problem
especially in like polite situations
like business situations or things like
that
people have stopped using problem and
they're starting to use the word issue
much more often because problem sounds
negative and problem is negative if you
have a problem with something that is a
negative situation
issue though can be sounds more neutral
or not as negative okay next one
two
where and how something began so we
think about a game like chess or we
think about a certain type of dress or a
certain type of doing things where did
it begin what was the origin
origin where did it start where did it
begin that's the origin how and where
something began
number three
able to be used or taken able to be used
or taken we say it's available
if
there is a seat empty in a restaurant
you can say is this seat available can i
sit there can i use it can i take it
if you go somewhere and you want to be
able to
use a piece of equipment for example you
go to a bowling alley and there's some
shoes on the shelf are they available
yes you can use those shoes to go
bowling right so are they available you
can use them or you can take them it is
available
next one to ask for an item or meal from
a business when you go to the restaurant
and you ask for an item or you ask for a
meal right what are you doing what do
you it's called an order i think you say
in korean jumun jumun haseo have you
ordered have you ordered
would you like to order or if i'm a
waiter right i say to the customer would
you like to order are you ready to order
now if i'm the customer i say excuse me
i would like to order now this is my
order okay so order you ask for an item
or a meal from a business not just in a
restaurant item if you're online you're
doing internet shopping then you also
can order products from a business order
an item some type of product so that we
say order that's a specific verb for
that action
five easy and quick to do law is very
convenient that word just kind of slid
right on in there very conveniently
right it was easy and quick to do it's
convenient modern life is very
convenient isn't it we just hit
some keys on our keyboard and somebody
comes to our door and gives us a package
wow how convenient is that we don't even
have to leave our house anymore to get
items from the store okay next one
possibly dangerous not joking
these two men do they look happy
well no they don't look happy doesn't
look like their team of course they're
dressed very funnily they're sports fans
obviously but they don't look happy they
look very serious they're not joking
and
it says possibly dangerous but i don't
want to say that these guys are possibly
dangerous but other situations can be
described as serious for example
conditions outside weather conditions
are serious
that could be possibly dangerous if you
hear that on the news be careful
if the tv or the radio announcer says
weather conditions are serious that
means there's a lot of snow maybe
there's ice or maybe there's a lot of
rain and there's a possibility of
flooding it could be dangerous so there
are serious weather conditions outside
but sirius doesn't always mean dangerous
it can mean by like these guys they're
not joking they're not happy they're
thinking about something very hard
they're very serious but i wouldn't say
these guys are dangerous
okay it depends on the situation okay
next one
taking almost no time to make what is
this of course that's ramyan right it
takes almost no time to make
in america people will usually say
instant instant ramen or another word
for ramyun is instant noodles okay but
we use the word instant because it takes
almost no time to make
now a long time ago when you if you
wanted to have noodle soup you had to
take a lot of time you had to buy the
noodles you had to cook them boil them
for a long time you know with water and
then go and get other spices and put
that in it took a while to make that but
with instant ramyan all you do is
heat water pour the water in there
keep it
closed for about a minute open it up and
eat it it's almost no time to make you
don't have to worry it's already
prepackaged it's already prepared for
you okay so it's very instant you can
make it very quickly instant
eight
throughout the world so something that
is spread throughout the world is
wide and we use this
suffix this ending for the word uh quite
a bit right worldwide
company wide throughout the entire
company
region-wide nationwide
throughout the region throughout the
nation and of course we're talking about
the whole world worldwide so why it is a
common ending
especially at the end of it some type of
area nation region company and when
you're talking about an area to mean
that it's throughout the entire
area throughout the world throughout the
company throughout the nation worldwide
company-wide nationwide okay
are you hungry this looks like a good
snack and it's a healthy snack too isn't
it it's a fruit that comes from tropical
countries like the philippines thailand
especially hawaii right hawaii has
specialized in growing these right what
is it what kind of fruit it's a
pineapple
pine apple of course they're not apples
that grow on pine trees
a different kind of tree right i'm not
sure where the word pineapple came from
but it's a special kind of fruit that
grows in tropical countries pineapple
good good snack uh good food for a snack
okay next one
a liquid that goes with another food so
a lot of foods that you eat especially
if you go to like a restaurant like tgi
fridays or some other place like that
and you have chicken wings
they usually have some other it's like a
liquid it's a very thick liquid right
it's not a liquid it's not like water
although some can be thin
it's called a sauce
a sauce usually they're kind of thick
and you dip your food into it right a
liquid that goes with goes with another
food so you either dip your liquid into
it or you pour it on top of your meal
and that of course is a sauce
next one
speed in action
this person is in a hurry in
a
hurry
so that's a common expression in english
when somebody is
moving quickly they're walking quickly
they're acting or you can it doesn't
even mean they're moving from one place
to another you could be sitting at your
desk working
quickly you are in a hurry so in a hurry
means to do something quickly or it
means to do something uh very fast okay
next one
the amount of food eaten for one meal
so if you only eat one of these bowls
and that's your entire meal we call that
a serving
one serving
usually people will say i will well it's
actually not usually just say i'll have
the steak and fries that's one serving
of a steak and fries or i'll have a bowl
of soup that's one serving if you want
two servings that means you have another
bowl of soup so one serving two servings
there are two servings here so the
amount of food eaten for one meal okay
sometimes people will have a lot of
servings for their meal right but it's a
serving okay it's typical but some
people are so hungry they want more than
the typical amount so they have another
serving okay
13. a business that has many copies of
its stores of course you guys know
mcdonald's mcdonald's is everywhere
right they're in almost every i think
they're in every country except for
north korea uh but they're almost
everywhere in the world right
a business that has many copies of its
stores
we call mcdonald's a chain store and
there are many types of chain stores of
course mcdonald's is perhaps the most
famous one because it's the most popular
one but there's other different
restaurants i mentioned tgi fridays
before tj friday's is a chain restaurant
outback is a chain restaurant but it's
not just restaurants it can also be
stores right for example you could have
like macy's macy's could be a chain
store in different in different cities
right because they're a large department
store they're not just in new york there
are also many other cities in america
so a department store could be a chain
store
lots of different businesses that have
shops in different areas or different
regions they are also called chain
stores
okay the next word here is kind of funny
cow meat now of course we don't say cow
meat in america that's a very strange
word it's kind of like saying
pada gogi for fish right that sounds
weird no you say bulgogi or you say
sangsan right
so you have special words for different
types of meat and if you i mean if you
say cow meat in america people will
understand they'll just think oh that
sounds funny it's like me going into a
restaurant and saying yes i would like
some pada gogi please the restaurant
people will probably understand what i
mean but they'll think well this
american is strange you know some weird
korean right so don't go to america and
say i'd like some cow meat right say you
would like some beef right so gogi is
beef in english okay
okay next one is 15
what you put on top of food so things
that you put on top of food especially
on top of ice cream right that's these
are
probably things that you put on top of
ice cream you get hungry
we call them toppings right so
especially if you go to a place
like baskin robbins sometimes they'll
have different toppings on your ice
cream but especially cold stone
near the cold stone ice cream chain
store they have many different toppings
that you can put on your food it's not
just ice cream
again it could be a meal it could be
steak it could be pasta
what is the topping that you put on
especially pizza when you think about
pizza has many different toppings and
you choose which topping you want on
your food
next one is 16 made ready to use before
it's needed so if you make something
now but you don't need it now you need
it an hour from now or you need it maybe
tomorrow what do you do
it's prepared
you prepare that food so after you
prepare it it is prepared
and by the way it's not just food
okay you could prepare other things for
example you could prepare your homework
the night before it's due is your
homework done yes it's prepared for
tomorrow so something that's prepared is
made ready to use before it's needed
the teacher doesn't need your homework
at 10 o'clock at night right the teacher
needs your homework the next morning but
you should prepare it the night before
so it's done your mother does the same
thing when she cooks meals right
many moms will will prepare meals
they'll put them in the refrigerator and
then take them out and warm them up for
the dinner because many moms are busy
these days sometimes though they'll
prepare a meal for a few hours before
dinner time right so they might start
cooking at four pm but you don't eat
until six
right so that's prepared they prepared
the meal for you okay
let's go over the words what uh what are
the words that we've just learned how
well do you remember them let's go over
the exercises
the first one number one i beep a new
sweater it will come in the mail soon it
will come
in the mail soon
so if what do you do you know a new
sweater could be anything really but you
it'll come in the mail soon what word
did we talk about that would fit here a
grabbed b made c ordered d sold well a
grab just means to go and grab something
if you grabbed a new sweater
it's not going to come in the mail soon
you have it in your hand you grabbed it
right so and you shouldn't grab things
that's not polite okay so not grabbed b
i made a new sweater if you made this
sweater you have it right it's not going
to come in the mail you have it now so
made doesn't fit
i ordered a new sweater ah that makes
sense right you ordered the sweater on
the computer or you order it on the
phone and then the company will send it
to you in the mail so that's the answer
i ordered a new sweater it will come in
the mail soon what about d i sold a new
sweater i sold a new sweater that
doesn't make sense because it will come
if you sell a sweater you're going to
send it through the mail it's not going
to come to you you're going to send it
away so that doesn't make sense okay
number three i'm sorry but we have no
tables
beep okay remember when we talked about
this word i use the example of the chair
if there is a chair that is empty that
you can use it right it is what well the
same thing about a table you go into a
restaurant and there's an empty table
right nobody is sitting there then that
table is what but if you go in the
restaurant the waiter says i'm sorry but
we have no tables
for your use no tables out no tables
instant no tables serious or no tables
available well right away we can see
available i'm sorry but we have no
tables available no tables are ready for
your use not out
not instant that doesn't make sense and
not we have no tables that are serious
that's just silly right so i'm sorry but
we have no tables available this one we
see right away uh no tables that are
ready for your use no tables available
six that was a beep test i don't know it
would be so hard and of course we have a
or an because some of the answers start
with about one answer starts with a
vowel so what was it
that was a what kind of test a what kind
of test
is a hard test what kind of test is a
hard test a difficult test
right
right
a quick test no
hard tests are not quick
b a convenient test convenient means
easy so that's not true it's a hard test
it's an instant test instant and quick
are similar right but that doesn't make
sense it was a serious yeah it was a
serious test it was difficult remember
serious doesn't always mean dangerous a
test cannot be dangerous but it can be
very difficult
or severe right serious it can be a
serious test that teacher is not joking
around the teacher is very serious about
us
learning the material so that was a
serious test it was a difficult test
seven
don't forget
right don't forget
dogs had their beep as wolves
now this one is interesting you have to
think about this a little bit
um
but what you need to know of course and
i mentioned this in a previous lesson a
long time ago
all dogs all modern dogs now
came from wolves right so all modern
dogs descended from wolves you think
about your your dog at home right
whether it's a beagle or it's a husky a
big dog you know
their ancestors were wolves a long time
ago there were no dogs that people had
as pets there were wolves and all those
wolves their babies after many
generations
evolved into different types of dogs
dogs that people have in their homes so
dogs had their what
as wolves as their future had their
origin had their problem or had their
mistake
well remember how and where some or how
and when or where something got started
is their origin
how did dogs come about well their
origin
is wolves right after thousands of years
of breeding human beings have
helped wolves will help wolves or made
wolves evolve into dogs right so um the
origin but all dogs came from wolf so
dogs origin is wolves not future that
doesn't make sense not problem that's
weird and mistake problem and mistake
are similar but they don't fit here the
best word of course is origin all modern
dogs had their origin as wolves very
interesting
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
part of this lesson let's take a short
break we'll come back and let's go over
the reading passage together so don't go
away
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary are you ready to begin
studying
the topic for today is kind of
interesting and you've probably
experienced it in your life right we're
talking about a home away from home a
home away from home
we're going to focus on
moving to a new home
have you ever moved in your life right
did you move to a new apartment or a new
house maybe you move to a new
neighborhood or a new city or maybe even
a new country right so people nowadays
move a lot
right you think about it uh and you know
sir there are some people who live in
one place all their life but it's
becoming more and more common for people
to move to different places and live in
a few different places when they grow up
i probably am a very extreme example of
that by the time i finished high school
i had moved about five times my family
moved about five times why
because my father is a jiji
right a geologist a geologist so his
company
sent him giallo just a geologist his
company sent him to many different
places in the world so when i was
growing up
you know i lived in new mexico wisconsin
north carolina papua new guinea
colorado arizona nevada we moved so many
different times because of my dad's job
so maybe your dad's job or your mom's
job takes you to different places or
maybe when you go to school when you go
to college you might go to another city
or maybe even a different country by the
way if you get a chance to go to another
country to study for college take that
chance look for that opportunity it's a
very good experience for you anyway
that's the topic moving to new homes so
nowadays it's not unusual for us to
think of any place can be a new home we
can move just about anywhere and live
anywhere so that's what we're going to
read about but first let's take a look
at the vocabulary
our first word is
new york loves ugly
that's not our first word it's just an
interesting
t-shirt a person whose home
is in a certain area
so new york of course is a very famous
town they're very famous for their
spirit right uh people who live in new
york they can call themselves citizens
of new york okay usually though we use
citizen for country for example people
who live in new york are citizens of
america they are american citizens
people who live in seoul are usually
korean citizens right if your if your
passport has the name of the country
on it right you were a citizen of that
country if you have a korean passport
you are a citizen of korea if you are
have an american passport you are a
citizen of america and the same for
every country in the world so which
country are you a citizen of
okay next one
do you know this place machu picchu
this is an event that a person goes
through if you go visit a world famous
place like this uh what do you say it's
an
up an experience an
experience so if you go and see machu
picchu in peru or you go see the
pyramids in egypt or you go see the
eiffel tower in paris france that is an
experience that you will remember
experience
experience
experience
experience okay so uh probably you have
good experiences of traveling maybe your
family has taken vacations to different
places right you have good experiences
of your traveling
next one to fit in naturally to fit in
naturally means to belong of course
these apples do they belong together you
might say well the red one doesn't
belong but maybe it does it depends on
how you look at it they're all apples
right so it belongs together because
they're all apples but maybe other
people say it doesn't belong because
it's red and the others are green but to
fit in naturally means to belong
somewhere it belongs with the others of
course if you go to the supermarket
apples are in one section sure you have
green apples red apples
yellow apples in different places but
they're all together kind of in the same
area they belong in the same area
this is a
interesting idea do you know this for a
type of living thing to change slowly
over time
so we think about this when you think
about the
the age of the earth how old is the
earth right
4.5 billion years old we can't even
imagine that time how long has life been
on earth since at least 3.5 billion
years right now
over that
long time life has changed into many
different forms what do we call that
process this is usually the the picture
that they usually show how accurate it
is you know maybe we don't know but it
shows that monkey-like creatures
changing slowly into human beings we say
evolve
now of course monkeys did not evolve
into human beings monkeys are cousins to
human beings this creature doesn't live
anymore it's extinct it's gone
but all living creatures have evolved
over time into different forms and
shapes if you look at horses go back and
look at the evolutionary history of
horses or very interesting look at
whales it's very interesting how whales
their ancestors came on land and then
went back to the sea they evolved they
changed over time so it's a very
interesting um
idea about the world and it was first
evolution was first proposed by darwin
charles darwin in 1860 something i can't
remember the exact date but of course
his his idea was very controversial but
nowadays most scientists
more than 90 percent of scientists
uh say that this is fact it's not a
theory anymore it actually happened and
when you think about it it makes sense
okay so evolve
okay so next one to create copies of
oneself so when a uh when adult
animals have babies what are they doing
they are reproducing so mama uh mama
sheep will have a baby sheep right a
lamb okay so reproduce
reproduce reproduce reproduce means to
make copies of oneself okay so
when animals grow up they become older
they become adults then they can
reproduce and have babies of their own
next one
to increase okay so something is
increasing what does it mean it means
rise so we can see a rise usually we use
this for charts when we're you know you
see business people using uh this type
of graph for to show an increase in
sales perhaps so they say there's been a
rise in sales okay a rise to increase
rise is a verb by the way
but also a noun
because i said there has been a rise but
you could also say sales have
risen okay rise rose risen
because as a verb rise is irregular
we say rise rose risen okay
but sometimes rise can also be a noun
okay next one
wow this is a very probably european
city very colorful very interesting
place but if you look at it you also get
the impression there's so many people
there wow it's really a lot of people so
to fill with animals or people is to
populate
populate populate so
you know a long time ago there weren't
that many people but people you know
increased the numbers of people
increased and increased the numbers of
people rose
and the earth was populated with human
beings okay and of course all sorts of
other types of animals
next one a group of people sharing
certain traits and beliefs if we look at
the american indian here we know that
american indians share certain beliefs
and behaviors they do the same things
and they believe many different things
of course different tribes have
different beliefs i'm not saying all
american indians are the same that's not
true but a certain group certain tribes
like the apache or the cherokee or the
mohican right they would have in their
tribes they would have the same beliefs
or the same traditions and of course the
same is true with countries korean
culture i gave just gave you the exam
the answer culture it's a group of
people who share the same beliefs
and
behaviors actually culture when you
think about a culture isn't really you
don't say culture is people say culture
is the beliefs or behaviors of a certain
group of people right it's what they do
so korean culture is different from
american culture which is different from
french culture okay so different areas
different groups of people have
different culture
or different cultures okay next one
number nine standing straight not upside
down so if you're standing straight up
right you are
upright up right now this is important
of course when you're shipping something
if you're sending something in the mail
you write on one side of the package or
this side up right you want it to be
upright you don't want it to be upside
down because that could be that could
possibly damage what you have in the
container also it's more natural for us
to be upright right when we're walking
around we don't walk around on our hands
upside down that makes our head hurt
okay next one
ten a group of people living and working
together so a group of people living and
working together what do we call them we
call that society and we don't society
is a singular
now okay society so not it not them but
it what do we call a group of people
living and work together what do we call
it we call it society
and societies have different sizes right
a society can be as small as your family
but usually we talk about society in
terms of like uh as big as a city or as
big as a nation or sometimes a global
society so the entire human population
in the world we can also think of it as
a society it depends on what our purpose
is what is our intention do we just want
to focus on a small group or are we
talking about issues that affect a very
big group so society when we think about
it can be small or big but usually we
think about it as the society in which
we live right what is the uh uh
you know the the behavior are the
beliefs or the customs the culture of
the people that we're living in with
what is the size of society and of
course what are the laws of society
that's something we have to uh think
about it as well the laws uh what do we
have to do to obey the laws what are the
expectations of society what are we
expected to do in society so society is
basically the group of people
in which we live
okay 11. well what's wrong with these
people they look very strange
they have really long legs the the idea
here is for most of the time for most of
the time we say generally
generally so if we talk about basketball
players we can make general
statements most of the time basketball
players are very tall they have very
long legs that look like golf clubs i'm
sorry
no they don't but usually basketball
players are very tall generally not all
sometimes you can find short basketball
players who are very good at passing the
ball or getting the ball down the court
but generally
usually
for most of the time basketball players
are very tall and we can make general
statements about different groups of
people but again be careful about making
general statements because you can
always find exceptions right it's not
always the same
okay next one
a long period of almost no food so these
people are looking for food and they
endure a long period when there no food
has been grown maybe it's too hot
there's no water so they can't grow food
we call that time a famine famine is a
period of time
that no food is available
a long time ago of course
when people couldn't grow crops or there
were no animals
to hunt right it was too hot there was
no water no food so we call that period
of famine nowadays of course famines can
be caused by
the supply chain breaking down right
people getting food to a certain place
and that could also cause a famine
next one wanting to know more so this
little boy is very curious most children
are very curious generally children are
very curious about the world around them
they are curious they want to know more
about the world
okay
next one to run away from run
right there's a bull i don't know if you
can see you can't see the head but this
is a bull with big horns and these guys
i think they're in spain perhaps
pamplona
where they have every year they run away
from the bowl which is crazy you know a
bunch of people will get ready they'll
release a bull and these guys will run
down the street running away from a bull
why
okay well different people have
different hobbies i guess okay so to run
away from means to flee to flee to run
away now flea is an irregular verb so we
say flee fled fled
fled fled
these men fled from the bowl okay they
are fleeing from the bowl
okay next one to come from a source
now to come from a source it means
descend to descend and we're talking
about evolution here it's a strange
picture but i think what they're getting
at is that on a chain right there's a
watch that descends from the chain but
uh to come from a source we can also
think think about the word evolution
remember the picture evolution
we saw the monkey type creature and then
we saw a human being so uh usually when
we especially talk about evolution we
say that the modern creatures the modern
animals have descended from
a previous animal usually not always but
generally these animals are extinct they
no longer live that we can't see them
nowadays sometimes they they still exist
in certain cases but usually our
ancestors are extinct right there are no
more uh
early humans that are alive people have
to go and dig up their bones right
um for the ancestors of human beings but
we descend from some source from a
source every living thing has descended
from one source
okay next one
in a single group so in a single group
we can say together so if the dog and
the cat are in a single group they look
like they're friends that's very
interesting picture
they're together right they're together
they're pals they're buddies they're
together in a group okay so you're
together with your friends probably when
you go out to play you're together in a
group
okay let's go over the words and see how
well you remember the vocabulary number
one hang gliding remember hang gliding
from a previous lesson right that's
where you're flying soaring through the
air onto bar with a wing above you hang
gliding is a great what a citizen b
bridge c experience d
culture
which word fits well is hank glenning a
great citizen it's a citizen of a
country
that doesn't make sense is it a great
bridge
that doesn't make sense either is it a
great experience remember an experience
is something that you remember it's a
memorable happening in your life
something an event or something that
happens in your life that's a great
experience so hang gliding is a great
experience isn't it because wow that'd
be great i haven't done it yet i would
like to someday but it would be a great
experience and d
of course hang gliding is not a great
culture that doesn't make sense hang
gliding something you do an event that
you remember it's a great experience or
it's an experience
number three
modern birds beep from dinosaurs okay
there's actually two words from the
vocabulary list that we could use here
but only one of those is here thank
goodness because if both of them were
here we would have to choose both but
there's only one so a populated b
evolved c reproduced and d created
let me tell you the word that could fit
here but not on the answer list and that
of course is descend
we could use descended
descended modern birds descended from
dinosaurs that would fit but it's not
one of our choices but remember when i
was describing or explaining the meaning
of this word descend we just did this
right a couple slides ago or i think was
the last word
descend
i said i gave you the example of right
all living three all living things
descended from a previous animal and we
saw that diagram we saw that idea with
which word of course it was with evolved
evolve so we could use either word
modern birds evolved from dinosaurs or
modern birds descended from dinosaurs it
means the same thing
not populated not reproduced not created
those don't fit we're talking about you
know a previous life form or a previous
type of animal
that gives birth that reproduces but
over a long time and changes into
another type of animal and that's
evolution that's also descending from
another species or another type of
animal so modern bird modern birds
evolve from dinosaurs and by the way
that's a very interesting idea
if you think oh dinosaurs are no longer
in the world they're all extinct
not true birds are a type of dinosaur
and we can see them every day very
interesting
okay
five school is strange i don't feel like
i what i don't feel like i if you think
school is strange
you don't
what i don't feel like i what i don't
feel like i a belong b make c empty d
slip
so if you think some place is strange or
a group of people is strange you don't
fit in
right you don't
belong i don't feel like i belong maybe
you do belong but you don't feel like i
belong that's too bad you have to make
some friends if you make friends you get
used to the people there you find out oh
they're good people then you feel like
you belong in a place right but if you
feel strange
about the people you're with you don't
feel like you have anything in common
it's hard to talk to them then you feel
like you don't belong okay not make not
empty not slip those don't make sense
the best one is belong
seven south america has a really
interesting what immigration bee culture
c famine or d hat well famine is not
interesting it's terrible it's horrible
so that doesn't work right it has has a
really interesting hat just one
south america has an interesting hat
it's a really big hat that puts on the
whole continent now that's crazy right
has an interesting immigration we don't
think of immigration as being
interesting we think of immigration as
being a pain in the butt right it's very
difficult right so the only one south
america has a really interesting culture
that would fit because the beliefs and
the customs in south america are very
interesting but by the way south america
has many different countries in south
america and of course there are
different cultures in each of those
different countries and maybe even
inside those countries there might be
different cultures inside the country so
south america has really interesting
cultures would be more accurate right
but you could if you're talking about
although the culture or the the same
beliefs and behaviors that all people
from south america seem to generally
show then that could be possible too but
it'd be more accurate to say there are
many different cultures in south america
and those cultures are interesting
okay that wraps up the vocabulary
section of this lesson let's take a
short break we'll come back and look at
the reading
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary we're on unit 5 we're
talking about
cycles not your bicycle but something
that repeats like a circle like the
wheels on your bicycle they go around
and around and they begin again and
again so that's what we're talking about
with cycles in lesson 13 we're talking
about the world's greatest traveler now
you're probably thinking the world's
greatest traveler is it marco polo no
it's not a person it's a thing we're
going to focus on the cycle of water and
we're going to see how
water
is the world's greatest traveler because
water really travels a lot and it
travels in a cycle it goes around and
around well we'll explore that idea
later on in the reading passage but of
course as usual we need to learn some
vocabulary first to better understand
the reading passage so let's get started
with the vocabulary
the first word is
defined as a series of events that is
repeated a number of times now you've
probably seen these types of pictures
before we can see a tree in different
stages and we know
right that this is spring this is summer
this is fall and this is winter and we
might think well seasons but we're
saying a series of events
that is repeated a number of times it's
not just the seasons the seasons is an
example of this but what are we talking
about we're talking about a cycle it's
like i talked about before right on your
bicycle right you have two wheels well
think about one wheel it starts here and
it goes around and it comes back to the
beginning right it's a cycle it's a
series of events that is repeated so it
goes around right it starts here maybe
in spring
goes round to summer
then to fall then to winter and it comes
back to spring so the seasons is a type
of cycle and there are many types of
cycles in the world around us we'll talk
about one in the reading passage
okay word number two
water that falls from the sky
so you're probably thinking about rain
right you know this word rain that's an
easy word but there's another word that
we use for rain that's longer it's more
of a scientific word and i'm sorry it's
kind of long right
pre-si
wow so many syllables there's five
syllables so let's say it fast
wolf slow first and then fast
precipitation
precipitation
one more time
precipitation
okay so if you say it quickly it sounds
like
precipitation okay precipitation just
means rain it's more of a scientific
word for rain
okay let's move on to number three the
process of water collecting together in
the air so the process of water
collecting together in the air now
you're probably thinking what is this
it's a cloud but we're not talking about
a cloud we're not talking about uh the
grouping of moisture in the air we're
talking about the process of and there's
a special word for that we call that
condensation
oh big words in this lesson right so
let's do this slowly
shun
condensation
faster
condensation
condensation okay so condensation is a
process it's the process of water
collecting together in the air and
clouds are formed
because of
condensation so if you think how do
clouds appear in the sky it's because of
condensation so condensation is the
process okay let's move on
for a liquid to be taken into the air
this is a sad picture right this little
boy he wants to go swimming but there's
no water in the swimming pool
what happened to the water in the
swimming pool well
it
evaporated right evaporate is a verb
it's also a process right it's the
process of a liquid to be taken into the
air on a hot day
if you have a a dish of water or there's
a puddle of water on the ground well
after some time in the hot day that
water will disappear right in the
summertime you look at the streets
they're very dry a truck comes by and
sprays water on the streets but after a
little while the water is gone the
street is very dry again because of
evaporation okay so evaporation makes
the water go into the air and then when
the air is cooled the air the water gets
together and condensation
happens okay so first evaporation then
condensation we'll talk about those
later but we need to know about those
words okay next one
five to suck up or drink in
to suck up or drink in
is to absorb
absorb okay we're doing some a little
bit difficult less words in this lesson
right now of course if you spill
something you can use a paper towel to
absorb
the liquid that you spilled on the table
okay so you can use a paper towel and
paper towels the companies that make
paper towels will boast they will brag
they'll say our paper towels have great
absorption power right they will absorb
a lot of liquid to take in or to to suck
up or to drink in or to take in okay
oh he's happy to become aware to become
aware of something is to realize it
looks like he had oh i have an idea
right it's like bing a light bulb goes
on over his head he realizes something
he became aware of something a lot of
famous inventors are scientists you know
there's stories about them you know uh
coming to a moment of realization right
like the famous uh greek uh
philosopher who sat in a bathtub and
said oh eureka right and realized he
could use uh the water the weight of an
object in a water to realize how much
volume it had okay so to realize it's
like the moment you understand something
next one for a liquid to move together
in a single direction for a liquid any
liquid to move together and a lot of
liquid moving togetherness in one
direction it doesn't have to be a lot it
could be a cup of water but if you spill
it it moves in a direction
this stream of course is moving in a
direction downhill what is it doing it
is
flowing flow is a verb to flow so this
small stream is flowing
quickly right because maybe it's a it's
kind of a not very steep but it's it's a
it's not flat it's uh you know there's
uphill and then downhill and the water
will flow quickly downhill so this is a
very active stream right okay
next one greatly needed or necessary
greatly needed or necessary is
essential if something is essential you
really need it
you
for example we think of uh when we think
of essential it's like things that we
need to continue to survive like food
food is essential
air oxygen is essential if we don't have
it we'll die right so we greatly need it
it's very necessary it's essential okay
next one nine whoa
looks like uh he's on vacation at a
resort
a large cloth used for drying so what do
we call this cloth you probably take it
to the beach with you or you take it
when you go swimming you use it when you
take a shower or a bath it's called a
towel a towel so
if you're in an english-speaking country
and you want a cloth to dry yourself off
you can ask
is there a towel please or can i get a
towel okay next one
a flow of water used to clean oneself i
just mentioned this word after you do
this you need a towel remember what i
said i said when you take a shower when
we use the word shower we use it in a
larger expression very commonly take a
take a shower we also use take a bath
okay now what's the difference between a
shower and a bath well you see this boy
here the water is falling
from the faucet above it's falling on
him like rain that's a shower but a bath
is where you have a bathtub and you sit
in the water right and the water's
already there and you clean yourself
with the bath water it's kind of like
when you go to a sauna right it's kind
of like a big bath right and you get the
sauna but a shower is like this style so
but we use take up take a shower take a
bath okay you should take a shower every
day
you should take a shower after you
exercise remember to do that right if
you don't take a shower oh some nim say
is sale right okay next one
11 a collection of water high up in the
sky we talked about this before right i
gave you the word before it's a cloud
right so this airplane is flying over
these clouds
it's very beautiful if you're ever in an
airplane very high up in the sky look
out the window and you can see the the
clouds below you
it looks like land but it's very
fantastic right very beautiful very
white and looks very clean
okay next one
not moving so this lake the water in
this lake
is what it is very still
still we can also say
calm
still or calm
calm means there's no emotion right this
is very peaceful
calm
the water is still no movement okay
that's a very beautiful picture
next one a very tiny bit of water so a
very tiny bit of water
what do we call that we call it a
droplet a droplet it's like a little
ball of water right when we
when we just drop a little bit of water
on something or when it rains just
lightly not a lot but the water will
collect in little drops in drops and we
call them droplets there's one droplet
two droplets you could also of course
just say a drop of water but sometimes
people will say droplet
okay next one
a small pool of water is a puddle so you
like to go splashing through the puddles
right okay this girl of course she's
wearing good shoes for that don't do
that if you're wearing shoes and socks
your mother will be angry right but if
you're wearing sandals or
rubber shoes like she's wearing no
problem have fun right go running
through the puddles of water kids like
to do that
okay next one icy rain it's rain
but it's really cold so it becomes icy
it's almost freezing we call that sleet
so sleet is you know it's not snow it's
not rain but it's like
almost
a combination of both it's where it's
really cold and it's raining and it's
it's almost icy right so it's icy rain
it's sleet now sleet is dangerous
because on the roads we have to be very
careful because as you know ice is
right it's slippery right so you have to
be careful when it's sleet outside you
also have to be careful when you're
walking
okay next one for a liquid to absorb
into something when a liquid absorb we
heard this word before right we talked
about the paper towel right the paper
towel will clean up the liquid it will
absorb into the paper towel we say it's
soaked right if you are soaked right
it's raining really hard like in the
summertime you go outside and you don't
have an umbrella you don't have a
raincoat you're just wearing normal
clothes what happens
you get water everywhere in your hair on
your shirt under your shirt on your
underwear is completely wet your socks
in your shoes
when you're walking right it makes a
noise you are soaked right so people
will say i
am
soaked
it means
i got water
everywhere right i have to take
everything off take a hot shower and
then dry off because i'm soaked okay so
to soak is for liquid to completely
absorb into something it doesn't matter
what it is it could be you your skin
right it could be a paper towel it could
be a dog you know whatever the water has
completely gotten in and onto something
that's to soak
okay next one
well not next one we need to look at the
words let's check the words that we just
learned make sure that we remember those
and how they are used so let's go over
the different problems here number one i
just beep that i forgot to do my
homework so
you just
what it's like you have an idea
and what is that i just a made b
realized
c spent
d
absorbed
so in this case right
we could use a word that means that you
had a sudden idea you suddenly became
aware of the fact that you forgot to do
your homework has that ever happened to
you it's not a good feeling oh my gosh
right it's at the beginning of the
lesson the beginning of the class
and you're suddenly realized oh my gosh
there was homework yesterday the teacher
gave us homework and i forgot suddenly
you have that idea that means you
realized i just realized oh i just
thought i just remembered i just
realized that i forgot to do my homework
not made not spent not absorbed those
don't make sense realized you suddenly
became aware of that fact
okay number four
birth and death are part of the beep of
life think about that
birth is at the beginning
right a person lives their life right
and then they die
now
of course for an individual person for
one person it's not
a continual process but if that person
is born they grow up they have a baby
right that person is born and they grow
so it's like it goes around in a circle
right so what do we call that birth and
death are part of the what of life end
beginning c cycle d loss
remember we have a beginning and then an
end and then it starts again right well
life continues right not for the
individual person unfortunately right uh
it's like a straight line birth and then
death but if we're talking about all
things like human beings right people
are born they die more people are born
they die it goes around in a continual
process so we call that what we call it
a cycle that's what i talked about
before right birth and death are part of
the cycle of life
okay if you watch the lion king maybe an
older movie maybe you haven't seen it
but at the beginning they talk about the
circle of life that's the same idea it's
the cycle of life they're talking about
constant death and constant renewal
constant death and constant birth it
goes in a cycle the circle of life
there's a song
associated with that okay but it's not
the end of life because birth continues
it's not the beginning because that's
only one part and it's not the loss of
life it's the cycle it goes again and
again
okay next one number five
when there is enough water in the sky it
will beep to form clouds now remember
before i talked about this how are
clouds formed what is the process
for forming clouds why are clouds formed
because it precipitates because it rains
no because it flows
right it will flow to form
uh clouds water will flow in the sky
that's weird that doesn't make sense it
will realize
water can't think right it will condense
ah condense
to form clouds
condensation is the reason that clouds
are formed if there's enough water in
the sky that water will gather together
and form clouds and we call that
the process we call it to condense right
and we call it condensation
okay
seven here this tissue will beep the
blood so if you're bleeding oh no you
have to absorb the blood right i just
gave you the answer right this tissue
will absorb the blood you need to
not drink it in but you need to
soak it in you need to stop that blood
so you use a tissue or maybe a bandage
to stop the blood it will absorb the
blood and then stop the bleeding
absorb not flow not cut not pinch but to
absorb the blood
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
section of our lesson today let's take a
short break come back and we'll do the
reading together so don't go away
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary i'm your host brian
stewart we're going over cycles still
we're still talking about cycles as you
remember cycles are things that don't
really start anywhere or finish anywhere
they just kind of go and they repeat
again and again
but what we're talking about in lesson
14 is what a farmer knows and we're
focusing on smart
farming methods
so farmers think about cycles
when they work they have to know about
cycles
in order to
grow the correct food for us of course
we need to eat and farmers
need to grow the food that we get at the
supermarket right so what do farmers
know about cycles how do they use their
knowledge to help them in their jobs
that's what we'll read about in this
lesson but again before we read before
we do the reading section we need to go
over a vocabulary a vocabulary list to
make sure we understand the reading
section well let's go so the first one
number one
of course we can see a farmer here with
some of his products right
now when we talk about the farmers
products we say the crop that is
gathered at the end of a season the crop
crop of course means the type of food
that the farmer's growing
when they gather at the end of a season
we call it
the harvest right so this is a noun
and we say that it is all of the food
that the farmer grows at the end of the
season now we can talk about the harvest
for one farmer but usually we talk about
the harvest and we mean all farmers for
a region or a nation
so if we say the harvest was very good
this year we're usually talking about
all farmers in our region the harvest
was very good this year so there's a lot
of food in the supermarkets maybe prices
are low
but of course we can also talk about
individual one individual farmer has a
bad harvest and another farmer has a
good harvest so bad harvest good harvest
it's the amount of food that they
collect
at the end of the growing season okay
next one number two to put seeds in a
field to grow well what do farmers do
they put the seeds into the ground in
the field to grow they don't do it by
hand
so much these days they usually use
machines but what do they call that they
call it to sow
to sow
and it's interesting uh there's a an
expression i think it comes from the
bible uh you
reap
what
you
sow
you reap what you sow reap means to
harvest to gather at the end you get it
but think about it
whatever you put in the ground that's
what you're going to get but not just
planting
seeds in the ground
if you lie
you're going to get a lot of problems
so if you
sow problems if you lie if you do bad
actions what will you get from those
you'll get bad results you reap what you
sow but if you do good actions and you
tell the truth and you're good to your
friends
then you will get a lot of appreciation
and good things back from your friends
so that's a good expression to remember
and it uses the word so
it comes from to put fields to put seeds
in the field to grow but also in our
life we're also sowing our life right
we're our actions are sowing uh the
results that we'll get later on so you
reap what you sow so is an irregular
verb we say so sowed sown
sowed sod so sod sown so we don't
normally use this word in our everyday
speech because we're not farmers but
sometimes we see expressions that do use
this word okay next one
to reach full growth to reach full
growth is
to mature
and we need of course when we're talking
about plants and crops like corn
tomatoes apples pears we don't pick
these things when they're young when
they're not mature we have to wait till
they are fully grown
then we pick them and eat them
if you pick the tomato before it's
mature
it's too small and it's green and oh it
tastes horrible right but if you wait
till it's mature and then you eat it
then it tastes good and it's larger okay
a plant grown by farmers so any plant
grown by farmers we already use this
word in the fir
in explaining the first word it's crop
so any plant grown by farmers is a crop
usually crops or things we eat for
example potatoes tomatoes
celery looks like they have here
squash
those are crops but it's not just food
because sometimes farmers will grow
things that we don't eat but that are
used in other uh purp for other purposes
okay
for example like barley that's used to
make a beer right well some people will
make food from barley too but farmers
don't just grow food they grow many
different types of plants that are not
just used for fruit food but any plant
that is grown by farmers is we call it a
crop
okay next one
a substance that keeps living beings
healthy and a lot of things we can see
the different listing it's a list of
what
nutrients right and we have this word
here nutrition facts they're very
similar nutrition has to do with the
things that we have to eat every day to
keep us healthy and those individual
things are nutrients you should choose
foods that have good nutrients and a lot
of nutrients in them usually junk food
like hamburgers and french fries
don't have a lot of nutrients right
healthy food has many nutrients these
are substances that keep us healthy
next one
to prepare the land for growing crops
farming is hard work right uh this
especially using this in a garden in
somebody's garden you have to what do
you have to do to the soil you have to
cultivate
you have to prepare the land for growing
crops now on a big farm they have big
machines that will
turn up the land that will cultivate the
field and then it's ready so that they
can put the seeds down they can sow the
land then
but this is what we call cultivate
cultivate isn't just for farming we can
also use it for other ideas for example
when you study you are cultivating your
mind you're preparing your mind for
later on in life right when you study
different subjects so you can cultivate
your mind parents can cultivate their
children it just means that you're
preparing them for something else when
you cultivate the land for growing crops
you are cultivating
okay next one
good for growing having plenty of
nutrients so if the land is good for
growing you can grow a lot of good uh
crops there and the land has a lot of
nutrients in the soil we say that the
land is
fertile
fertile
and if the land is not fertile we say
it's in fertile
in means not so if you think of the
desert can you grow plants in the desert
no you can't because the desert is
infertile there's not enough nutrients
in the soil of course there's not enough
water
okay but if you see good rich earth and
you pick it up and it's black or it's
very dark brown or black earth that's
fertile soil it's good it has a lot of
nutrients in it it's good for growing
crops it's fertile
okay next one
eight to use again and of course we know
this symbol here we see this in many
places these days but of course this is
what you should do with your garbage if
you're finished with a plastic bottle
what should you do you should use it
again you should re-cycle
re
means again right and cycle we know that
work right it goes in a cycle so we
recycle we use it again and again
and this is what we should do with our
garbage right plastic here paper here
metal here other garbage in another
place recycle your garbage then we can
use it again
number nine
and animal waste animal waste
we think about animal waste in a
previous lesson we talked about this
right about training your dog remember
you may remember what do pets do dogs go
poo and pee
poo
and pee
of course
okay and p of course is the water
this is animal waste now it's
interesting because farmers use animal
waste they use it to feed plants
did you know that right if your dog goes
poo poo next to a tree that's good for
the tree because the tree uses that as
there are nutrients in the poop of
course it's very disgusting we shouldn't
you know you know don't touch it don't
get near it but
plants like it right because that's
their food okay so animal waste and
remember we are animals too so it can be
human waste not just your dog
animal waste that is used to feed plants
we have a special word for it we don't
call it or pea or dung we call it
manure
manure
and it's usually like cow manure or
horse manure it could be other types of
animals but usually it's cow manure
because farmers have cows a lot of cows
and what are they doing they're pooing a
lot so they use that
for manure and in fact that's an
industry some companies make manure
that's their job they take the animal
waste and they make it into manure that
looks like this and they sell it to
farmers and so they transfer it so
that's an industry that's a company
right it's very interesting business
okay next one
ten having a bad smell before i said poo
is nem se na payo right we say stinky
you can also say stinky oh your feet are
stinky oh and i'm saying
right you say your feet are stinky or
somebody's breath
it's stinky or somebody's you know
underarm stinky
okay stinky next one
11 to take away not shoes but to take
away means to
to drain so imagine this poor guy here
his energy is drained it's like a
battery right your cell phone battery uh
the battery
is gone you take away the battery power
by using your cell phone you drain the
battery
some people's people it's like they have
a battery their body they lose all their
energy they feel drained i feel drained
that's some some people can say that
that means i have no energy it's all
gone
next one acting in a smart and sensible
way so someone acts in a smart and
sensible what is this girl doing she's
she's pushing away the hamburger and the
coke and instead of eating the hamburger
she's eating an apple this is sensible
so she is wise
wise is like smart but wise also means
you have a lot of experience you're
acting on experience smart smart kind of
means you're intelligent you maybe you
know about how to solve math problems or
you know how to do that but wise is more
like life experience if you know how to
act in a sensible or practical way
because of your life experience you are
wise and that's usually why older people
are wise because they have more
experience in life there's a little
difference between wise and smart right
wise is usually because of past
experiences you act in a sensible way
okay next one
a big open space filled with plants so
of course this is famous is this gordian
is it right uh do you have the tea um
the the the plants that they make tea
from green tea korea is famous for tea
and there's a place in in korea that is
very famous for growing tea it looks
like this is a picture from that area or
an area similar to that but it doesn't
matter if it's tea it could be corn it
could be wheat it's a big open space
filled with plants we call it
a field okay farmers need
usually it's usually flat of course if
it's on a hill or a mountain it's not a
field really it should be flat and
farmers need wide open fields to grow
their crops field okay 14 absolutely
necessary so what is it it's a seat belt
absolutely necessary it's crucial
now a seat belt some people may argue
well seat belt's not absolutely
necessary right a lot of times i don't
get in an accident but nowadays because
of safety and because of the traffic
laws
we think seat belts are absolutely
necessary they're crucial they're very
important because if you do get in an
accident they are absolutely necessary
to make sure that you are not injured or
killed so they are crucial crucial
something that's needed very much
next one okay i was talking about poop
before right clean up after your dog
means scoop up the poop right
now this definition though unused food
that the body gets rid of right unused
food when you eat something your body
uses most of the food but some of the
food it doesn't use and that food passes
through your body what do we call it we
call it waste
okay now before you may have encountered
ways to sometimes people refer to
garbage as waste and that's possible
right especially for like a big
factories or big businesses have a lot
of waste it's like extra
stuff that they don't need we call that
waste but it we also call
the organic the food the edible
material that passes through our body
and we get rid of when we go to the
bathroom we call that waste
okay
okay next word last word is facts and
ideas that are known facts and ideas
that we know those are knowledge so
think about that
human beings are
getting more and more facts and more and
more ideas
every year every 10 years every 100
years the amount of
knowledge of that human beings have
gathered together especially over the
past several hundred years has grown
by a lot so we talk about that knowledge
as
we talk about those ideas and those
facts as knowledge so facts and ideas
that we know about that's knowledge
there's many things we don't know about
but
human beings are very curious we keep
learning about our environment and so
our
our area or our degree of knowledge
keeps growing
okay well those are the words let's do
the exercises see how well we remember
those words okay number one we need to
beep the field before we spread the
seeds so before you spread the seeds and
put them in the ground what do you need
to do you need to prepare the field is
that pull cultivate sow or cover
remember so
is spread the seeds
so we need to do something before we sow
the field we need to
cultivate the field remember cultivate
means to prepare to prepare something we
need to prepare the field before we
spread the seeds we need to cultivate
the field before we spread the seeds
okay number three
we've cultivated there's that word again
we've cultivated that field with plenty
of manure
it is very beep okay
so again part of cultivating part of
preparing the land is you know like
turning uh you know making a rose in it
or or breaking up the top surface so the
seeds can get in the land easily but
another part of cultivating is putting
manure on the ground right so when you
put manure on the ground remember manure
has a lot of nutrients in it that's good
for the plants and when we say a plant
an area is good or has a lot of
nutrients it's good for growing we say
that land is fertile fertile
we've cultivated that field with plenty
of manure it is very fertile or fertile
some people pronounce it different ways
fertile
so not useless not marked not understood
but fertile okay next one
five you should beep that bottle you can
fill it back up with water fill it back
up
so
you have a bottle right a plastic bottle
of water okay uh i'm not going to throw
it away i'm going to use it again i'm
going to fill it back up with water
because why should i throw it away right
still good right
so what should i do i should use it
again what word means to use again a
recycle b harvest c believe or d crack
of course you know a means to use again
you should recycle that bottle you
should use it again because you can fill
it up with water again don't throw it
away use it again
seven that plant is not healthy not
healthy it needs more what what do
plants need to grow well what did i talk
about before what do plants need to keep
their bodies strong and healthy not just
plants but also animals
nutrients
crops
fields or knowledge okay now we're
talking about healthy right not smart
besides plants can't think they don't
have brains so right away we know
knowledge is not the answer
crops no because that's a type of
food that farmers grow fields it needs
more fields that doesn't make sense it
needs of course more nutrients nutrients
are what living things need to stay
healthy so that's the answer
okay well that wraps it up for the
vocabulary section let's take a short
break and we'll come back and look at
the reading together
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary we're on our last lesson
of the book i hope you enjoyed studying
with me but we have one more lesson to
go so we have some more something more
interesting to go over before we finish
with the book and of course we're still
talking about the topic of cycles right
things that go around that continue and
continue they don't really have a
beginning or end they just continue to
go
this lesson lesson 15 we're talking
about as the earth moves so now we're
talking about the cycle of the earth's
motion as you know you should know the
earth moves around the sun that's a
cycle but we'll talk about some other
cycles too that you may not know about
concerning the earth's motion so that's
what we're going to read about we're
going to focus on earth's motion and
weather so we're not just talking about
the motion of the earth but we're also
talking about how does that affect
the weather how does that change the
weather on earth right when the earth is
moving through space
what effect how does that change the
weather on earth so it'll be an
interesting lesson about that but of
course as usual let's study some
vocabulary so that we can understand the
reading passage more quickly when we get
to that okay the first
word on our word list is defined as to
understand well and i hope you've
understood my lessons well what is
another word to understand well it's to
comprehend it's a big word right
comprehend only three sounds so not so
bad
comprehend
comprehend means that you understand
well so like i said i hope that you
comprehend my lessons with you well i
hope that you can comprehend and i hope
that i explain things well enough okay
good so number two
to make bear when you make something
bare like
when i get a haircut right
i expose
my head if i get a really short haircut
so you can see my skin then i've exposed
my head right to expose something to
make bear if i roll up my sleeves you
can see the skin on my arms i have
exposed my arms right i'm not going to
do it it takes too long but you get the
idea right you take off a hat you've
exposed your head to the sky outside
okay so to expose to make bear next one
half of a sphere now a sphere what is a
sphere
a sphere is a round shape but not just
two dimension
three dimensional that's a sphere so if
we look at the earth right the earth is
a
three-dimensional circle right it's a
sphere a circle is only two dimensions
right a circle is just
two dimensions but a sphere is three
dimensions we can see the shape in 3d
okay so half of the spirit well now
we're talking about half
half of a sphere so if we talk about
half of the world usually we talk about
like the northern half or the southern
half and when we do that we use a
special word and that word is hemi
sphere
hemi now think of this word it's one
word but think of it in two sections
first we have hemi
and then we have sphere of course you
know a lot of english words are
shorter words or smaller words that are
joined together in this case hemi is a
greek
word it's it has its origins in the
greek language as many words do have
origins in greek or latin right in this
case hemi is a greek prefix
hemi
means half
hemi is half so if we say hemi half a
sphere
we're talking about half of a sphere and
so we say the northern
hemisphere or the southern hemisphere
sometimes people will also say the
western hemisphere and the eastern
hemisphere saying that the west is uh
for example europe and america and the
east is asia
right sometimes people will say that
but usually you know it's it's hard to
say you know where where does it stop
and end but it's easy to know north and
south because there's the equator right
there's the equator right here that is a
good dividing line for north and south
so we can easily say northern hemisphere
and southern hemisphere okay next word
number four
maybe you've seen this picture before
it's not to scale right if it was to
scale it would be too big we couldn't
show it here
but this shows the sun and all the
planets
around the sun
and we see that the planets have these
lines these circles going around and we
see to move around an object in space
right this is space out here nothing's
really out there also we see a comet
over here that also moves around an
object in space all of these objects are
moving around the sun
we say they are orbiting around the sun
so
mercury venus earth mars they are all
orbiting around the sun they are moving
around the sun the comet is moving
around the sun now on a planet like
jupiter which has many little moons
those moons are orbiting around jupiter
our moon the moon that we see at night
orbits around earth okay so there are
many different orbits that we can see in
the night sky it just means an object a
big object is moving well not even a big
object could be a small object like when
astronauts go into space they go around
the earth they are orbiting the earth to
move around another object in a circle
or some type of circle
okay number five the very top or bottom
of the earth so here we're looking at
antarctica antarctica and on the other
side of course
there's no land right antarctica is a
land mass there's no land on the other
side but what we're talking about we're
talking about the very top or bottom of
the earth of course we're talking about
the poles and here we see the south pole
antarctica is at the south pole there's
no land at the north pole but there is
ice right and animals do live up there
like for example polar bears live on the
north pole santa claus has his house at
the north pole right okay so so these
are the poles south pole or north pole
number six
to be on top of so to be on top of
especially to um
be all over the top of not just sitting
on the top here but all over the top
means to cover
so this blanket is all over the top of
the car and it hides the car actually we
can't see the car we know it's a car
because we can see part of it right here
but
if we can't see it we see that the this
blanket or this sheet covers the car
okay so cover doesn't just mean to be on
top of something like for example
there's a dog here right i'm not a very
good artist but okay
anyway that's a that's my doggie
if the dog is sitting up there the dog
is not covering the car to cover means
to cover all the the entire surface of
something to to cover a large surface of
something that's to cover
seven
not circular shaped like an egg so this
looks like a mirror right okay but it's
not a circular a circle is more like
this now can i draw a circle i'm okay
that's not a very good circle i again
i'm not a very good artist but if you
can draw a perfect circle very quickly
perfect circle that's a circle but this
is not a circle this looks like an egg
so what do we call it we call it
elliptical elliptical now an easier word
of course is also oval an oval shape
this would be an oval shape but more
scientific word is elliptical
elliptical elliptical shape is like an
oval it's not a perfect circle
okay eight
a particular length of time
so a particular length of time you know
beginning and ending and we call that
you know that's a certain period of time
i just gave you the word period a period
of time is what we call a particular
length so an hour
is a period of time a minute is another
period of time a second is a period of
time so there's many different periods
of time it's just a particular length of
time we give it a name
okay number nine
now this girl has a decision to make
right she can go right or she can go
left so she's thinking of something what
is the verb that means to think of
something especially to to think about
it deeply is to consider she is
considering okay what's the fastest way
to get to the store should i go right or
should i go left okay so she's thinking
about it okay she's considering her
choices especially when we have a choice
to make we consider the good points and
the bad points about each choice and
then we make our decision so we consider
number 10
something that influences or has a part
in so something that influences or has a
part in we call that a factor now this
is more of a
maybe a scientific word right a factor
is like for example i just said we think
about the good points or bad points all
the good points that's a factor all the
negative or bad points those are also
factors we call those pros
and
cons right
pros are good points and cons are bad
points
these are all the factors that we use we
think of all these things when we
consider something so they're all the
things that influence our choice or has
a part in our choice or the result of
something those are factors
okay next one
uh oh somebody's in trouble right i
think the cat knocked over the uh the
potted plant and the dog is looking at
the cat saying you're in trouble you
know when master comes home okay
to be the cause of something is to be
responsible for
responsible so re
responsible
who is responsible for this mess
who is responsible for breaking the pot
i think it's the cat what do you think
who's responsible but sometimes you know
if something happens there's an accident
that happens people will ask who's
responsible they'll also ask another
word they'll use another word fault
right
fault and when you use fault you can say
it's
my
fault if you say it's my fault that
means i am responsible
i
am responsible i am responsible it's my
fault
whose fault is it
who is responsible it means the same
thing
okay
12. oh
kipchio maybe quiechio maybe a little
ugly but it's very cute right these two
dogs
in a very small way now what are we
talking about we're talking about
slightly
so these two dogs are slightly similar
i'm not really sure what we're going
we're doing with the picture here but
slightly in a very small way maybe
they're licking their lips slightly all
right just a little bit in a very small
way slightly if you do something but
it's not in a big way it's in a small
way you can say slightly give you
another example
it rains right sometimes it rains
heavily really coming down that's not
slightly it's not slightly raining it's
heavily raining but if it's raining and
just the little tiny drops are coming
down you could almost go outside without
an umbrella you won't get too wet it's
just raining slightly just choke them
right
right just a little bit of rain is
falling from the sky it's slightly
raining
okay next one
here it looks like a calendar monday
tuesday wednesday not long lasting if
something doesn't last a long time it
only lasts one two or three days it
doesn't last very long depending on what
it is right if we're sick for three days
we think it's a long time but really
it's just short term right it's done in
three days it's over in a day or three
days right
short term it doesn't last very long
what's the opposite of short term well
of course we would say
long term pandero right
long term is the opposite pandero of
short term so you can talk about
something that's short term you talk
about something that's long term okay
those are opposites
fourteen now somebody made a mistake
here right one plus one equals three
that's crazy
the word is uh defined as something that
is smart and logical we would say it's
it it sensible sense it makes sense now
usually when we use sense
in a sentence we don't say it's sense
don't say it's sense say
it
makes
sense you have to remember
use this word here it
makes sense don't just say it's it's
sense no
it makes sense now this doesn't make
sense this
doesn't
doesn't
it doesn't make and then we use s
because it doesn't it doesn't make sense
one plus one equals three that doesn't
make sense okay it's not smart it's not
logical okay so when we use the word
sense we use it to describe something
that's smart and logical that makes
sense that's logical well something is
not logical we say it doesn't make sense
okay
okay next one
for the entire year and of course this
looks like
i'm not sure but i think it's mount
everest in the himalayas and you think
about mount everest whenever you think
about mount everest you think of snow
and it doesn't matter what time of year
it is it could even be the summer time
there's still snow
in the mountains on this mountain
because the mountain's so high so for
the entire year
we say
year round there is snow
there is snow
year-round on mount everest that means
all year long there is snow on mount
everest it's year long
okay
last one according to science this guy
is very smart right he's he's doing some
kind of engineering diagram okay
technically if you he's doing something
and he's getting into you know according
very specifically how it's used
technically
uh you know you could say it's according
to a scientific method according to
science it's done in a very logical
or in a very detailed way and you're
breaking down all the different parts
how is each part going to work well
that's a technical drawing so they've
done it very technically now sometimes
people will use this word technically
right adverb to describe
something exact for example
a lot of things we say we just say
generally
and they may not be true right exactly
they might not be true in all cases so
in that case we say well
technically that's not true
technically
okay well that's that's not the common
case you know generally it's this way
but technically it might be a little
different okay so we'll see that later
on in the reading passage okay let's go
over these words here let's do the
exercises choose the word that best
completes a sentence can you beep this
math problem
so when you're looking at a math problem
sometimes math problems are difficult to
understand so we might ask our friend
can you what this math problem usually
maybe we're looking for a word like
solve or understand right
well what word means that a behave b
comprehend c orbit and d cover well of
course we're looking for comprehend can
you comprehend this math problem because
comprehend means do you understand this
math problem if you understand it
if you understand it then you can solve
the math problem first though you need
to comprehend it you need to understand
it once you understand it then you can
solve it right so not can you behave not
can you orbit
this math problem that's weird
can you cover this math problem oh i'm
afraid cover it hide it right that's
that's strange too what we want is can
you comprehend this math problem do you
understand it
okay next one is a command beep your
eyes you shouldn't see this so if your
friend says oh don't look right you want
to do this to your eyes what am i doing
right so i cannot see something am i
orbiting my eyes
that would be really weird right my eyes
turn around that's strange now i'm not
orbiting my eyes am i comprehending my
eyes well i understand my eyes but i can
still see that's weird right we don't
say that
make your eyes
how do you make your eyes that doesn't
make sense
cover ah
cover your eyes right so you have a
surprise i want to surprise you cover
your eyes open a surprise right so first
cover your eyes that's the answer cover
your eyes you shouldn't see this so you
don't want somebody to see something
cover your eyes
okay next one
number five
i have a short beep of time for lunch
so you have a certain length of time for
lunch it's a short length of time what
do we say i have a short orbit of time i
have a short pole of time i have a short
period of time or i have a short cover
of time which one sounds good probably
you chose period whoa that's too fast
okay but anyway i have a short period of
time i have a short period of time for
lunch so maybe only 30 minutes 30 minute
period for lunch not one hour just 30
minutes so it's a short period of time
now this one jumped up too quickly but
that's okay the north pole is in the
arctic remember we talked about pole
right we have a north pole and a south
pole those are the top and the bottom of
the earth and the north pole is in the
arctic not the north orbit not the north
cover not the north period that's weird
but the north pole the north pole is in
the arctic where is the south pole the
south pole is in the antarctic ant are
arctic yes if we can spell it right oh
yes we did okay arctic okay
you can see because arctic you just use
arctic here but antarctic means the
opposite antarctic okay so arctic
antarctic
okay well that wraps it up for the
vocabulary section next we're going to
use those words in the reading passage
so stay tuned don't go away

02:05
hey kids how are you doing it's nice to
02:07
see you again my name is brian stewart
02:10
and we are here to study from
02:12
reading for vocabulary we're starting in
02:15
level d on unit one and our subject is
02:19
architecture that's a little bit of a
02:22
difficult word isn't it
02:24
architecture architecture
02:27
our lesson one the title is a dream job
02:32
so when we think about that what we're
02:34
going to focus on is what do you want to
02:37
do
02:38
in the future have you thought about
02:40
that
02:41
let's think about the job
02:43
architect
02:45
architect okay so that's what we're
02:47
going to study in this lesson let's
02:50
begin
02:51
of course there are many different jobs
02:53
look at all these jobs can you find the
02:55
different names of the jobs we don't
02:57
have time to go over all of them but we
02:59
can just quickly we can see there's a
03:01
doctor all right maybe there's a lawyer
03:04
over here there's an electrician over
03:06
here there are many different kinds of
03:09
jobs when you think about your future
03:12
what kind of job do you want well we're
03:15
going to talk about one
03:17
exciting job in this lesson okay
03:20
but let's talk about a few vocabulary
03:22
words first as you can see here a quick
03:25
basic drawing
03:27
can you draw something like this are you
03:29
a talented artist if you can draw like
03:32
this you can make a sketch this is a
03:35
sketch it's a quick basic drawing now
03:38
this doesn't look too basic this looks a
03:40
little complicated but a quick drawing
03:43
of something like your house
03:45
a building your school that's a sketch
03:48
okay let's move on
03:50
this next word is to decide how
03:52
something will look or work when people
03:55
sit down and they start to think about
03:58
how to draw something what are they
04:00
doing right we can say that that is
04:04
design
04:05
design we can use it as a verb or as a
04:08
noun what is the design of the building
04:10
or he is going to design the building so
04:14
we can use it as a verb or a noun
04:18
a plan for making something so
04:21
this looks very complicated this is not
04:23
a sketch this is a very detailed drawing
04:27
but it's a plan for making something we
04:29
call a blue print why is it blue because
04:33
the paper that they draw on has a blue
04:36
color and it's very technical it's very
04:39
detailed drawings of something we say
04:42
it's a blue print a blueprint very
04:45
technical or detailed drawing of a
04:47
building
04:48
okay next one
04:50
do you have a knife like that it's a
04:52
swiss army knife right
04:54
what something is used for what is
04:56
something used for we can say what is
04:59
its function if we look at this knife
05:02
there are many different parts right
05:05
this has a different function from this
05:09
this this knife its function is just to
05:12
cut
05:13
this
05:15
pliers its function is to hold something
05:18
very tightly right so many things have
05:21
different functions what is the function
05:24
of this tool
05:26
okay let's move on
05:28
oh warning you shouldn't smoke of course
05:31
you don't now don't smoke in the future
05:33
right a rule or law no smoking we see
05:37
signs like this
05:39
many different places right no smoking
05:41
jucha kumji right no parking right so
05:45
we can say that's a regulation so we can
05:48
call a rule a law or regulation that's a
05:51
hindura word right
05:53
regulation
05:54
regulation okay let's move on
05:58
someone who works with the law okay as
06:02
you know we were talking about jobs
06:03
before i pointed out somebody right that
06:06
was a lawyer right he was on the side
06:09
over there a lawyer is someone who
06:11
argues
06:13
for or against
06:16
a position in a court of law so they are
06:19
called a lawyer there's somebody who
06:21
argues for something there's someone who
06:23
argues against something there's two
06:25
lawyers usually in a courtroom at least
06:28
two
06:29
okay next one
06:30
what kind of crazy guy is that he's got
06:32
four arms okay
06:35
the state of being focused and working
06:37
hard he doesn't really have four arms
06:39
he's just really busy it looks like he
06:41
has forums he's a monster right okay
06:44
next uh this this word is dedication if
06:48
somebody is so focused on their work
06:52
they have a lot of focus and sometimes
06:54
when you do your homework you're like
06:56
this right you're very focused on your
06:57
homework you want to do a good job
07:00
you have a lot of dedication
07:04
okay that's like you'll shim but also
07:06

07:10
okay next one
07:11
something that could happen okay
07:14
something that could happen this is a
07:15
little bit of a dangerous position right
07:18
possibility it's possible that she could
07:21
fall off this is not a good idea
07:24
okay so it's pos it's a possibility
07:27
something that could happen but also
07:29
she's reading about maybe she's reading
07:31
about interesting stories and she's
07:33
saying thinking
07:34
is it possible that this could happen
07:36
maybe there's a night that she's
07:38
thinking about oh there's a knight in
07:39
shining armor it's possible that one day
07:42
i could meet that person right so it's a
07:44
possibility what's possible in the
07:47
future
07:48
the next word
07:50
have you been to one of these do you
07:51
like baseball do you like soccer
07:54
if you go to a sports game you will go
07:57
to a large open building where people
07:59
watch sports i hope you have the
08:02
opportunity to go to a place like this
08:04
what is this what kind of building is it
08:08
it's called a sports
08:10
stadium so we use two words sports
08:14
stadium okay so if you go there you can
08:17
watch your favorite baseball team or
08:19
your favorite soccer team okay
08:23
wow this looks like it's in australia
08:25
right the road is very straight
08:28
and doesn't curve and it's very long we
08:31
can see really far
08:33
having no end if something has no end
08:37
there's no end we say it's end less
08:40
because this uh yeah i'll do that right
08:43
there this
08:45
part of the word when you see that less
08:47
it means it doesn't have one and
08:50
less there's no end okay endless
08:55
the next one a sudden dangerous
08:57
situation okay of course this is an
09:00
ambulance looks like somebody is hurt
09:02
what do we call that situation we say
09:05
it's an emergency
09:07
it is an emergency emergency
09:11
we can also use emergency as an
09:14
adjective it's an emergency vehicle it's
09:18
an emergency worker
09:21
this is emergency services so emergency
09:25
can be a noun it is an emergency or it
09:29
can be an adjective
09:31
it is emergency services okay let's move
09:35
on
09:37
to do the same as of course this is mama
09:39
duck and she has her baby ducks behind
09:42
her what do baby ducks all birds right
09:45
really do this
09:46
when mama duck is walking along all the
09:48
little birds what do they do they
09:51
follow mama duck right to follow if you
09:54
do the same thing as somebody else you
09:58
are following them to follow okay next
10:02
one maybe okay put together in a smart
10:07
and simple way
10:09
so this person is putting together kind
10:11
of a complicated diagram but
10:15
he's thinking about how he puts it
10:17
together so he's thinking about it in a
10:19
smart way and he's trying to make it
10:22
simple so what can we call that we say
10:25
that's organized organized as an
10:28
adjective these plans are very organized
10:31
right we can also call people organized
10:35
maybe you know somebody in school who is
10:37
organized they have all their books in
10:39
the right place all their pens in the
10:40
other place they're very neat they're
10:42
very organized okay next
10:46
someone who designs buildings and
10:48
machines so this is a type of job this
10:51
person is designing maybe a building or
10:54
a machine what do we call that person we
10:57
say that that person is an
10:59
engineer engineer so that person is an
11:03
engineer
11:06
next one is working hard and completing
11:08
a lot of work if you work really hard
11:11
and you get a lot of work done what can
11:13
we say we can say you you are productive
11:18
productive you're productive are you
11:21
productive
11:23
at night do you do all your homework
11:25
really quickly or do you play games
11:27
okay if you play games you are not
11:29
productive but if you study hard and you
11:32
get your work done then you are
11:34
productive okay
11:37
next one is sad and having no energy
11:39
this person is happy she has a lot of
11:42
energy but these people are not
11:44
they're sad what's going on they are
11:46
depressed right they're sad about
11:49
something if something happens and it
11:51
makes you sad or it makes you
11:54
feel not very good we can say that you
11:57
are depressed i hope that you don't get
11:59
depressed if you do get depressed just
12:01
think about the happy side just think
12:03
tomorrow is a new day something good
12:06
will happen so hopefully we we aren't
12:08
depressed very long okay
12:11
now let's begin with the exercises okay
12:14
how well do you remember the words we
12:16
just learned let's go over them
12:19
um in this exercise we need to choose
12:21
the word that best completes the
12:23
sentence our word choices are here and
12:26
we need to fill the blank with these
12:28
word choices so what is the sentence the
12:31
sentence in this case number one
12:34
do you think you could beep
12:37
our poster for art class
12:40
so what we're thinking about here is
12:42
you're going to be able to do something
12:45
can you
12:46
can you beep our poster for our class we
12:49
need a verb all of some of these are
12:52
verbs but some of them are nouns but we
12:55
need a verb here because we want to do
12:57
something to our poster for art class
13:00
what will you do
13:02
if you are a creative person maybe
13:05
somebody wants you to
13:06
create or make an art poster a poster
13:10
for art class so which word is similar
13:13
to make or create
13:16
a listen
13:17
that doesn't make sense you want to
13:19
listen to poster that doesn't make sense
13:20
b
13:21
function
13:22
function's a noun it doesn't doesn't
13:24
make sense here
13:25
design ah design has the same meaning as
13:29
make or create that's our answer right
13:33
blueprint as i said before that's a noun
13:36
right so you don't blueprint a poster
13:38
you design a poster so that's the answer
13:41
do you think you could design our poster
13:45
for art class okay that's the answer
13:47
there how about number two
13:50
the question is or the sentence is i
13:52
looked at your beep
13:55
of the whale
13:56
it's really good for a new artist
13:59
so somebody
14:01
did something right they made something
14:04
that shows a whale
14:06
if you draw something or you make
14:09
something a picture right
14:11
of an object we can we can say that that
14:15
is a picture or a
14:18
drawing or what is similar to drawing
14:20
here we have a blueprint you make a
14:23
blueprint of a whale no because
14:25
blueprint is for buildings right you
14:27
don't make a blueprint of an animal
14:29
that's kind of weird you make a
14:31
blueprint of a building if you're an
14:33
architect or
14:35
somebody who designs buildings
14:37
b
14:37
sketch ah we talked about this before a
14:40
sketch is a basic drawing so if you very
14:43
quickly draw a picture of a whale that
14:46
is a sketch and that's the answer b
14:49
what are the other ones c site site is
14:52
just a location right a site is like a
14:56
place that doesn't fit here a place of
14:58
the whale that doesn't make sense
15:00
i looked at your emergency of the whale
15:02
that doesn't make sense at all right so
15:04
the only one that makes sense is sketch
15:06
i looked at your sketch of the whale
15:10
it's really good for a new artist that's
15:13
our answer there let's move on to number
15:15
three
15:17
the question for number three is the
15:19
beep of the skull is to protect the
15:22
brain
15:23
remember when we talked about that swiss
15:25
army knife that had many different tools
15:27
and we talked about what is the use of
15:30
each of those tools everything has a use
15:33
or what let's take a look here a
15:35
blueprint
15:37
the skull of course is the bone in your
15:38
head right it's the hard bone what does
15:41
it do right do we talk about the
15:43
blueprint of the skull is to protect the
15:45
brain that doesn't make sense
15:48
do we talk about the location of the
15:50
skull that doesn't make sense either do
15:52
we talk about the sketch of the skull
15:55
we're not talking about a drawing of
15:57
somebody's head we're talking about the
16:00
use or the function
16:03
what is its use you have a skull it's a
16:06
hard bone in your head you can feel it
16:08
right now if you want to with me right
16:09
it's pretty hard what does it do it
16:12
protects your brain your brain is inside
16:15
your skull it needs protection so the
16:18
skull's function
16:20
is to protect the brain so the function
16:23
of the skull is to protect the brain
16:26
that's the function
16:27
okay number four
16:29
your son broke the law
16:31
no
16:32
that's terrible okay
16:34
you need a beep okay so if somebody
16:38
breaks the law right that person goes to
16:41
court and what do we find in court
16:43
remember there's two people one four and
16:45
one against right what type of person do
16:48
you need to help your son do you need an
16:51
engineer
16:52
no an engineer
16:54
makes buildings and machines right so
16:56
that's not appropriate we need a lawyer
16:58
ah remember we talked about lawyer
17:01
lawyers are the people in court one four
17:04
and one against one is for the client
17:06
one is against the client or the person
17:08
who broke the law so we need a lawyer if
17:12
i hope not but if our son breaks the law
17:15
then we need a lawyer
17:17
c is artist and d is architect right an
17:22
artist just draws pictures we don't need
17:24
them they can't help us and architect
17:26
designs buildings so they can't help us
17:29
we need a lawyer okay
17:32
so that's the answer there your son
17:34
broke the law you need a lawyer
17:38
okay let's continue from number five
17:40
there are many people
17:43
to follow when you drive a car now of
17:46
course you don't drive a car but if your
17:49
mom or dad is driving a car and you're
17:51
riding remember look at the signs on the
17:54
side of the road it says speed limit
17:57
don't go too fast it says you can't turn
18:00
this way
18:01
those are rules or laws of the road what
18:06
is another word that means rule or law
18:10
let's take a look well a is regulations
18:13
that's our answer there regulations so
18:16
the answer is there are many regulations
18:18
to follow when you drive a car not
18:21
sketches not emergencies and sports
18:25
stadiums that doesn't make any sense the
18:27
best answer is regulations there are
18:30
many regulations to follow when you
18:32
drive a car
18:34
six
18:35

18:50
school right get rid of it
18:53
does he need depression no i hope jim is
18:56
not depressed right if he's sad he won't
18:59
do well in school
19:01
does jim need more anxiety anxiety means
19:05
worry
19:06
now he maybe jim if jim worried more he
19:09
would do better in school that's
19:11
possible but a better answer is
19:14
dedication right so the better answer is
19:17
dedication dedication means
19:20
enthusiasm you shim right he needs
19:23
energy he needs dedication he needs to
19:26
focus on his work if he had more
19:28
dedication he would do better in school
19:30
i hope you have dedication too right
19:33
okay let's move on to its dedication of
19:35
course if jim had more dedication he
19:37
would do better in school let's move on
19:40
to number seven
19:41
there is a beep that it will rain
19:44
tomorrow so when we're talking about
19:47
tomorrow there are many things that
19:49
could happen tomorrow
19:51
rain is one of those things that it
19:54
could happen so when we talk about
19:57
things that could happen we are talking
19:58
about what are we talking about a site
20:01
no remember site is a location a place
20:04
so it's not sight is it possibility yes
20:08
possibility means something could happen
20:11
there is a possibility it is possible i
20:16
just use that word in a different way
20:18
you can do that it
20:20
is
20:22
possible
20:25
okay so this word you can use it in
20:27
different ways we say there is a
20:30
possibility that's noun it is possible
20:34
that's adjective right so we use it in
20:37
different ways and these are very common
20:39
ways to use that word
20:41
okay so there is a possibility that it
20:45
will rain tomorrow okay number eight
20:48
the beep for the new school is almost
20:51

21:04
design of that school what are we
21:07

22:49
architecture
22:51
we're going to learn about famous
22:53
architecture in the world we can think
22:56
of famous buildings or structures that
23:00
were built
23:01
in history and that we remember do you
23:04
know some of them let's go through some
23:06
of the like wonders of the world famous
23:09
buildings and structures for example do
23:12
you know this one you probably do if
23:15
you've ever read about egypt especially
23:19
ancient egypt you will know what these
23:23
structures are there's actually two the
23:25
first one here is the great pyramid of
23:29
giza the great pyramid of giza giza is a
23:33
place
23:34
in egypt where there are many pyramids
23:38
and these of course are tombs where the
23:40
dead kings or pharaohs of the egyptians
23:44
were put into these pyramids and of
23:46
course the other famous structure is the
23:49
sphinx the sphinx which is also very
23:52
famous okay
23:54
the next one is do you know this one of
23:56
course it's the eiffel tower
23:59
eiffel tower in paris
24:02
france whenever people think about
24:04
france or think of pictures of france
24:07
and especially paris we usually think of
24:10
the eiffel tower it's a landmark
24:13

24:16
most of these buildings the pyramids the
24:19
sphinx the eiffel tower these are
24:21
landmarks in seoul what is a famous

24:31
is a famous landmark you see it you say
24:33
oh i know where i am and i know that
24:35
this is famous for being in this city so
24:38
the eiffel tower is a famous landmark in
24:42
paris
24:43
also very famous landmark in china many
24:46
people think about it is the great wall
24:49
built a long long time ago hundreds of
24:52
years ago to keep the barbarians of the
24:55
north out of china the great wall of
24:57
china one of the biggest most impressive
25:01
uh arc pieces of architecture in the
25:04
world you can see it from space
25:07
wow okay
25:09
the next one the south focade the south
25:12
kade of the white house so in other
25:16
words if you look at the white house if
25:18
you think of washington d.c the u.s
25:20
government especially the president
25:23
then we
25:24
instantly recognize this image because
25:27
of the building this it's a unique style
25:30
of building and this of course is the
25:32
south side
25:34
fakad or facade i'm sorry facade is the
25:38
south side of a building and that's the
25:40
front entrance basically okay
25:43
next
25:45
machu picchu have you heard of machu
25:47
picchu that name sounds kind of funny
25:49
right that same sounds kind of cool
25:51
this is a very mysterious city it's not
25:55
just one building it was a whole city
25:58
built out of stone all the people
26:00
disappeared hundreds of years ago we're
26:03
still
26:04
archaeologists scientists are still
26:06
trying to figure out
26:08
who were they why did they leave what
26:09
happened we still don't know it's very
26:12
mysterious and of course this is in
26:14
south america it's machu picchu on the
26:17
top of a high mountain
26:20
okay
26:21
the last one here is the taj mahal in
26:24
india maybe you've heard of this this is
26:26
very famous symbol for love because a
26:29
prince built this huge building because
26:33
of his love for his
26:35
his lover the woman that he loved
26:38
so he built this very beautiful building
26:41
and it still stands today and it's a
26:43
very big tourist attraction and it's a
26:46
symbol
26:46
of love the taj mahal in india
26:50
okay those are some examples of famous
26:53
architecture in the world many of them
26:55
are famous i'm sure you've probably
26:57
heard of them before but let's take a
26:59
look now at uh
27:01
the vocabulary we're going to need in
27:04
order to read the passage the first word
27:07
that we're going to talk about here is
27:09
defined as a structure a structure some
27:13
type of building could be small could be
27:16
big a structure we put dead people in
27:19
sounds kind of funny we put dead people
27:21
in it but of course when somebody dies
27:24
you know there's the question of what to
27:26
do with the person's body after they've
27:29
died right
27:31
in some cases they put them under the
27:33
ground they bury them underground that
27:35
would be a grave
27:37
some people they don't want their body
27:39
to be put in the ground they would want
27:41
to be burned right by fire and that's
27:44
cremate to cremate
27:46
this is a great subject huh very
27:49
exciting subject but anyway graves
27:51
cremate but this is another way another
27:54
type of
27:55
putting the dead body and this is called
27:57
a tomb a tomb is usually above ground
28:00
it's a small building like this it might
28:02
have a door or it might not have a door
28:05
but sometimes it has a door you go in
28:07
and there are spaces for the different
28:10
uh bodies usually a family like an
28:12
important or rich family will have a
28:14
tomb and they put their the coffins the
28:18
bodies in different spaces on the wall
28:20
and the relatives or the descendants can
28:22
go and visit the ancestors okay that's a
28:26
tomb
28:27
okay
28:28
next word is something we store things
28:31
in of course you probably have many of
28:33
these your mom has many of these in the
28:35
refrigerator she keeps food in them you
28:37
store something in them they're called
28:40
containers and nowadays many containers
28:43
are made of plastic of course containers
28:46
can be made of metal of wood of all
28:49
sorts of different materials but most
28:51
containers today are made of plastic and
28:54
we store we keep things in those
28:56
containers
28:58
the next word is to pull over the ground
29:01
now they're just playing but sometimes
29:03
if you see a mom the little boy or girl
29:05
they don't want to go and mom's like
29:07
pulling them along the ground what's
29:09
going on she's dragging
29:12
the kid on the ground right
29:15
so it's kind of funny
29:17
to pull over the ground of course
29:18
they're just playing
29:21
pipes that carry water and other liquids
29:24
so in a house there are many pipes that
29:26
carry hot water they carry cold water in
29:29
a factory uh pipes will carry lots of
29:31
different types of liquids what do we
29:33
call those we call that system of pipes
29:37
plumbing so really it's not just the
29:38
pipes it's the system of pipes if you
29:42
think about your house
29:44
okay if you think about your house you
29:47
have a kitchen sink right you have a
29:49
toilet those are all different pipes
29:52
for water coming in and water coming out
29:54
if there's a problem you say we have a
29:57
problem with the plumbing
29:59
you need to call somebody over a plumber
30:02
to fix it
30:03
okay next one whoa this guy's rich
30:06
right he's like uh he's uh he's like mr
30:09
scrooge but he has a lot of money
30:11
having a lot of money don't call him
30:13
scrooge we can say he's rich right
30:16
scrooge is a specific meaning it means
30:18
somebody who doesn't like to spend money
30:21
but not all rich people are scrooges
30:23
some rich people like to spend their
30:25
money right but just if you have a lot
30:28
of money you are rich okay but we can be
30:32
rich in other things too you can be rich
30:34
in love you can be rich in knowledge
30:37
right so you can be rich in a lot of
30:38
different things
30:41
okay next one to make someone or
30:43
something do what you want this is a
30:46
it's like a puppet a
30:48
puppet
30:50
master
30:51
okay a puppet is a little doll that you
30:54
can control by strings these would be
30:56
the puppets and he's the puppet master
30:58
but this word that we're looking for the
31:00
puppet master controls the puppets he
31:04
controls if you make somebody or
31:06
something do what you want you are
31:09
controlling a person or a thing okay so
31:13
that's to control
31:15
now something made of many parts of
31:18
course a building is made of many
31:19
different parts many machines are made
31:22
of different parts look at your computer
31:24
it has many different parts inside of it
31:26
it is a structure even a computer can be
31:30
a type of structure a building of course
31:32
is obviously a type of structure it is
31:35
something that is made of many different
31:38
parts it has many parts to it
31:42
made by people this is very famous i
31:44
think it's uh near qatar or near abu
31:48
dhabi
31:49
in the middle east very famous i forgot
31:51
exactly where this was but they made the
31:53
islands like this and then they put
31:55
houses on them wow it's really cool so
31:58
made by people but it's not natural
32:00
that's the point here this you
32:03
you're not sailing your boat you go oh
32:04
look uh the island looks like a palm
32:07
tree
32:08
it's not natural it didn't happen by
32:11
nature it happened because it was man
32:14
made people designed it they thought
32:16
about it they designed it and they made
32:18
it it's man-made
32:20
our experience our life on earth now we
32:23
are surrounded by man-made things
32:27
three thousand years ago most of the
32:29
world was natural there weren't many
32:31
man-made things but nowadays we live in
32:34
we live there are many man-made things
32:36
cities uh resorts uh buildings
32:39
everything in your house man-made okay
32:43
a large
32:44
triangle-shaped building so we talked
32:47
about this before right it's a triangle
32:49
it means it has three sides right a
32:52
triangle and it's shaped like a triangle
32:54
of course what did we call i'm not
32:55
talking about this right i'm talking
32:57
about this here a large triangle-shaped
33:00
building is a pyramid and i talked about
33:03
that right we said the pyramids of giza
33:06
right not the sphinx the sphinx is
33:08
separate it's there it's it's part of
33:10
the architecture but um the pyramid is
33:13
what we're talking about here triangle
33:15
shaped building
33:17
now to be around for a period of time
33:22
he looks so happy doesn't he okay so to
33:25
be around for a period of time is to
33:27
last right he's thinking
33:30
how long is this lesson going to last
33:32
i hope you're not thinking that i hope
33:34
this is exciting but he's not very
33:37
excited about the lesson he has a
33:39
hinduro job right he has to teach this
33:42
this young boy maybe math or something
33:44
like that but how long is it going to
33:46
last how long will it be around will it
33:49
be around for one week one month
33:52
a hundred years
33:54
how long will something last how long
33:56
will it last okay next one
33:59
a building where people practice
34:01
religion so of course many people in the
34:03
world are religious and there are
34:05
different religions there are different
34:07
buildings
34:08
one of those buildings is called a
34:10
church
34:11
people who are christian
34:13
go to a church people who are jewish go
34:17
to a temple or synagogue people who are
34:21
muslim they go to a mosque okay so there
34:26
are many different buildings where
34:27
people practice religion this one we can
34:30
see it's christian because of the cross
34:32
so we call it a church but different
34:35
religions will call their buildings
34:37
different names this is for the
34:39
christian religion okay
34:42
a set of steps built between two floors
34:45
so if you have steps like this built
34:48
between two floors what can we call it
34:50
we can call it stairs
34:52
and notice the s
34:54
because there are many of them right so
34:57
we always talk about it in the plural
34:59
because of course you have to have many
35:01
stairs not just one if you had only one
35:04
there wouldn't be that wouldn't be
35:05
stairs right you'd have to jump up there
35:07
can you jump that high you can't so we
35:09
need a series we need many steps we need
35:13
many stairs to go from one floor
35:16
to the next floor stairs
35:19
next one a passage built underground of
35:22
course in korea you can find many of
35:24
those in seoul there are many of these
35:26
you know korea has many mountains
35:29
so and the roads have to go you know
35:31
straight
35:32
but there's a mountain so you need to
35:34
make what through the mountain you need
35:36
to make a
35:38
tunnel so you make a tunnel through the
35:40
mountain so the road doesn't have to go
35:42
up you know and around and it takes too
35:44
long just go straight through the
35:45
mountain and make a tunnel okay
35:49
a large machine that moves dirt or rock
35:53
okay
35:54
what is this machine we call it a
35:56
bulldozer but to tell you the truth this
35:59
isn't actually a bulldozer i actually
36:01
worked at a company where we had where
36:03
there were many machines like this when
36:05
i was in america we call this actually a
36:08
front end loader front
36:10
end
36:11
loader
36:13
a bulldozer has a big blade on the front
36:16
and it can move up and down but it
36:18
doesn't scoop up dirt a bulldozer pushes
36:21
dirt so a bulldozer is one of those
36:23
machines you see that pushes dirt in
36:26
front of it this is a front end loader
36:28
it's used for scooping up dirt and
36:30
putting it into a big truck but a large
36:34
machine that moves dirt or rock that
36:36
would be a bulldozer it just pushes it
36:38
out of the way
36:39
okay
36:40
something that makes us wonder
36:44
a lot of the things that we saw before
36:46
like the pyramids of giza the eiffel
36:48
tower the taj mahal when we see those we
36:51
go wow that's amazing how did people
36:55
build that right it makes us imagine uh
36:59
what people a long time ago how they
37:01
lived how they could do those types of
37:03
things well not maybe not so much for
37:05
the eiffel tower but for the pyramids
37:06
sure and also for this one this is
37:08
stonehedge in england
37:10
something that makes us wonder we can
37:12
call it a marvel it is a marvel right
37:17
and that's where the word marvelous
37:19
comes from right ous by the way means
37:23
full of so if something is full of
37:26
marvel it is full of wonder right uh it
37:30
is marvel it is a marvel that's noun
37:33
adjective it is marvelous
37:36
you look marvelous okay so for example
37:39
okay next one
37:40
to make objects by cutting wood or stone
37:44
so there are some types of artists
37:48
that make works of art
37:50
from
37:51
wood or stone what are they doing
37:54
they are carving they carve the wood
37:58
they carve the stone to make
38:02
beautiful marvelous shapes
38:06
okay so they carve you can carve soap be
38:08
careful with the knife right be careful
38:10
you can carve soap to make little
38:12
statues okay but you can carve something
38:15
to make a piece of art okay now let's
38:18
review the words we just learned let's
38:20
see how well you remember that with a
38:23
exercise so let's take a look our our
38:25
instructions are here choose the word
38:28
that best completes the sentence so our
38:30
words are here under each sentence and
38:33
we need to fill in the blank with one of
38:35
these words number one
38:38
johnny an exclamation mark so i have to
38:40
say johnny
38:42
don't beep your blanket in the dirt
38:45
think about little johnny he has a
38:47
blanket right the blanket should be
38:50
clean but what is he doing he's doing
38:52
something maybe he's walking and the
38:54
blanket is in the dirt what's happening
38:58
don't control your blanket in the dirt
39:01
that doesn't make sense don't drag a
39:04
drag don't drag your blanket in the dirt
39:08
if you have a blanket right and you're
39:10
not holding on to it like this you just
39:12
hold one end and the other end is on the
39:15
ground and you're walking along
39:17
the blanket is dragging in the dirt and
39:19
it's getting dirty mom doesn't like this
39:22
don't do that okay
39:24
so
39:25
don't drag your blanket in the dirt not
39:28
don't run that doesn't make sense don't
39:30
cut your blanket in the dirt why would
39:32
you cut your blanket that doesn't make
39:34
sense the best answer is drag don't drag
39:37
your blanket in the dirt mom doesn't
39:40
like it it gets very dirty
39:43
okay number two
39:44
we need a beep for the rest of the food
39:48
so imagine this you're eating lunch
39:50
right but you're full ah pebble right i
39:53
can't eat anymore right
39:55
no more pebbles so you have but there's
39:57
food left what are you going to do with
39:59
it you're going to throw it away no
40:01
that's wasteful
40:03
you're going to store it
40:05
and put it in the refrigerator what do
40:07
you put it in we need something for the
40:10
rest of the food we need something to
40:11
put the food in
40:13
what is it a structure a structure like
40:16
a small building no
40:17
we don't put it in a small building do
40:19
we need a container
40:21
yes that's what we talked about when i
40:23
said container i said your mom probably
40:25
has many containers
40:28
in the refrigerator she keeps food in
40:30
them so we need a container for the rest
40:32
of the food do we need a tomb
40:35
no don't keep your food in a tomb that's
40:38
weird okay and church
40:41
don't keep your food in a church i mean
40:43
you can you might be able to eat food in
40:45
a church but that's kind of rude don't
40:46
do that they do eat one type of food in
40:48
the church but that's a long story
40:50
anyway
40:52
so the best word is of course container
40:54
we need a container for the rest of the
40:57
food you need something to store your
40:59
food in that's a container okay number
41:01
three
41:03
my uncle owns a jet airplane wow
41:07
the uncle is very he has a lot of money
41:11
if he has a jet airplane he has a lot of
41:14
money what do we say a person who has a
41:16
lot of money he is so what he is so
41:18
architect doesn't make sense that's not
41:20
correct grammar anyway he is so man-made
41:24
that's just silly
41:25
his mom and his dad made him no that's
41:27
we don't say that uh he is so rich
41:30
because he owns a jet airplane like i
41:33
said that costs a lot of money he is so
41:35
handsome it doesn't matter if he's
41:38
handsome or ugly if he owns a plan
41:40
anybody can own a plane it doesn't
41:41
matter what they look like
41:43
what matters is how much money they have
41:45
you need a lot of money to own a jet
41:48
airplane so he is so rich
41:51
number four this new car is hard to beep
41:54
it is too big
41:56
if you of course you don't drive but if
41:58
you have a small car a small car is easy
42:00
to drive you can turn it very quickly
42:02
but a big car it takes more power now
42:04
when you're driving it you know you have
42:06
to steer it different places you have to
42:09
try to what
42:10
you have to understand your car oh car i
42:13
understand you no we don't worry about
42:15
that it's a machine we don't worry about
42:16
understanding the car
42:18
we need to sit
42:20
it's hard to sit you sit your car sit
42:22
car no that's strange the car is just a
42:24
machine
42:25
it's hard to control okay that's the
42:28
answer because a big car right you need
42:30
a lot of power to turn it or to get it
42:33
to go or to get it to stop
42:35
so that's the right answer this new car
42:37
is hard to control it's too big a big
42:40
car is harder to control not hard to
42:43
look so the answer is this car is hard
42:45
to control it is too big
42:47
moving on number five the toilet is
42:50
broken
42:52
when we talked about this word i told i
42:54
talked about that said you have many
42:55
pipes coming in your house and going out
42:57
of your house your sink your toilet
43:00
we need new if the toilet is broken if
43:03
those pipes are broken what do we call
43:06
that system of pipes if you remember we
43:08
called it plumbing we need new plumbing
43:11
not bulldozers not containers not
43:13
churches plumbing plumbing is the system
43:16
of pipes in your house that controls
43:18
your sink your toilet uh that's about it
43:21
in your house your shower
43:23
okay
43:24
six rob built a big what out of wooden
43:28
blocks
43:29
he built what he built a big
43:31
something he used wooden blocks to build
43:34
it it's probably a structure because a
43:38
structure is like a building you don't
43:40
build plumbing out of wooden blocks
43:43
wood does not make for good plumbing
43:45
right because it doesn't hold water very
43:47
well it's very hard to shape wood
43:50
built a big man-made that's an adjective
43:53
not a noun and dedication that doesn't
43:56
fit that doesn't make sense the best one
43:57
of course is you build a structure a
44:00
structure like i said is a building it
44:01
could be a small building it could be a
44:03
large building okay so he built a
44:05
structure out of wooden blocks
44:08
now
44:09
number seven
44:11
when my grandfather died we built a what
44:14
for his body remember we talked about
44:16
that that was our first word
44:18
when somebody dies people think well
44:20
what to do with the body i talked about
44:21
three different ways grave cremate or
44:24
what was the last one the last one was
44:26
tomb when my grandfather died we built
44:30
a tomb for his body and that's actually
44:32
the only answer because you don't build
44:34
a grave you dig a grave
44:36
you don't build a cremate you that
44:38
doesn't make sense but a tomb is like a
44:41
structure so you build a structure you
44:43
build a tomb so because of this really
44:46
the only possibility is tomb well
44:49
you wouldn't build a tunnel or an
44:50
apartment for a dead body right you
44:53
would build a tomb
44:55
okay number eight the beep mountain
44:57
isn't as big as a real mountain
45:00
so think about that a real mountain in
45:03
this case real can be natural okay so
45:06
what's the opposite of natural the
45:08
opposite of natural is
45:10
man-made okay so the man-made mountain
45:13
isn't as big as a real mountain if you
45:16
think about it people might make a
45:18
mountain
45:19
for some reason part of the neighborhood
45:21
part of a park but it's very difficult
45:23
to
45:24
make a mountain as big as a real or
45:26
natural mountain right so the man-made
45:28
mountain isn't as big as a real mountain
45:33
okay
45:34
that wraps up the vocabulary section of
45:37
lesson two let's take a short break
45:39
we'll come back and take a look at the
45:40
reading don't go away
45:53

47:08
very thoughtful with the white hair but
47:10
anyway this is him he's very he was a
47:12
very famous architect now what are some
47:14
of the buildings that he left behind
47:17

47:23
fact he designed and he had built many
47:25
different houses and if you're lucky and
47:28
if you are an owner of this house you

that are like monuments or statues and
47:58
this is this is an example of one of the
48:02
monuments or statues that frank lloyd
48:05
wright
48:06
created so architects don't just
48:09
create one type of building like a house
48:12
or an office building they do many
48:16
different things architects can be very
48:18
creative and build all sorts of
48:20
different structures and we'll read
48:22
about that later but before we get to
48:24
the reading we should go over the
48:26
vocabulary
48:27
the first word we're going to study here
48:29
is the word to describe something that
48:32
doesn't go straight now if a road goes
48:35
straight we say okay it's straight it
48:37
doesn't have any what it doesn't have
48:40
any
48:41
curves okay if you see a road that goes
48:44
to the right or it goes to the left we
48:47
say it has a curve we can say there is a
48:51
curve in the road be careful slow down
48:55
if you're riding your bike it's you can
48:57
go fast if it's straight but slow down
48:59
on a curve
49:01
okay next word now looks like this is
49:04
the she lives here right she's answering
49:06
the door and she is coming by why she is
49:10
someone who goes to a place for a short
49:12
time who what do we call this person we
49:15
call this person a visitor
49:18
she is visiting her
49:20
she is visiting her right so she is a
49:23
visitor
49:25
to her home okay if you come to my house
49:28
you are a visitor to my house if i go to
49:31
your house i am a visitor to your house
49:34
a visitor
49:36
the next one to change how someone
49:38
thinks or acts
49:40
so if you want to change the way someone
49:43
behaves maybe you don't like their
49:45
behavior or maybe you want to improve
49:47
their behavior like for example in a
49:49
sports game you need to influence you
49:52
need to influence them so the fact that
49:55
mom and dad are they like to play tennis
49:58
they like to play sports that will
50:00
influence their daughter she will grow
50:03
up and she will like to play sports too
50:05
because they're changing how how someone
50:08
else thinks or acts you influence them
50:12
who has influenced you in your life
50:16
next one
50:17
the area around something okay so if we
50:20
say that like there's many buildings in
50:22
a city what do we call the area around
50:25
the buildings we call it the environment
50:28
it's also the area around us right we
50:32
can have different environments if we
50:34
are in the city we say we are in an
50:38
urban
50:39
urban environment urban means city we
50:43
are in the city that's the type of
50:45
environment we're in but if we go to the
50:47
country then we say we are in a
50:51
r i'm sorry i was thinking about the
50:53
pronunciation
50:54
a rural
50:55
be careful because pronunciation is
51:00
right r and l
51:02
rural rural means you're in the country
51:05
so you can have an urban environment
51:07
that's in the city or you can have a
51:09
rural
51:10
environment there's just one l
51:13
that's out in the countryside so
51:15
different environments it's the area
51:17
what is your environment like
51:20
next one wow very pretty looks like
51:22
somewhere in europe maybe switzerland
51:25
it's very pretty if we talk about the
51:27
land being very pretty we can say it's
51:29
beautiful also another specific word for
51:32
the land we say it's scenic.
51:36
scenic so beautiful very pretty it's
51:39
beautiful if we're talking about the
51:41
land the landscape we say it's scenic in
51:44
switzerland it's very scenic countryside
51:47
it's very beautiful countryside next one
51:51
to have information about if you have
51:54
information about something you know it
51:57
so what information do you have inside
51:59
your head
52:00
that's the same as asking what do you
52:02
know now no is an irregular verb so we
52:07
use it when we're talking in the past
52:08
quago right we say no
52:11
chigum
52:12
nu
52:13
chane
52:14
and non maybe for a long time i have
52:18
known that for a long time so to know no
52:22
new known
52:24
ah
52:25
did you know i was from america yeah
52:27
i've known that for months okay uh
52:30
i knew that before okay and what do you
52:34
know now no new known okay next one
52:38
useful items in our home that we can
52:41
move around so there are many useful
52:44
items you can sit on them you can put
52:47
things inside them there are containers
52:49
you can put things on top of them so
52:51
we're talking about chairs sofas tables
52:54
cabinets useful items in our home that
52:57
but we can move them around they're not
52:59
fixed right this is a fireplace we're
53:02
not talking about that you can't move
53:03
the fireplace right it stays there but
53:05
the things you can move around we call
53:08
furniture
53:10
furniture
53:13
be careful
53:14
when we say furniture we mean everything
53:18
furniture is non-count
53:21
don't
53:22
no no s at the end of furniture
53:26
never say furnitures
53:28
it's furniture there's a lot of
53:30
furniture in this room or there's only
53:33
one piece of furniture in this room okay
53:38
there's a little furniture or there's a
53:40
lot of furniture but don't use s it's
53:43
non-count okay
53:45
to finish doing something important you
53:48
finish doing something important right
53:50
so you have achieved something to
53:53
achieve
53:54
what have you achieved in your life
53:56
right you've graduated from different
53:59
grades in elementary school maybe you're
54:01
going on to middle school or starting
54:04
high school you've achieved uh you've
54:06
successfully achieved graduating from
54:08
these different grades
54:10
you maybe got an a on a test hopefully
54:13
more than one test you've achieved
54:15
you've made many achievements
54:17
okay so you have achieved something now
54:19
achieve meant
54:22
as one word that's the noun but achieve
54:25
just achieve that's the verb what did
54:27
you achieve i have many achievements
54:30
okay next one
54:33
natural like plants and animals when we
54:35
go to the store and we buy something we
54:38
want to look for maybe organic
54:41
foods organic means they were made
54:43
naturally think about that we think well
54:45
plants are natural what are you talking
54:47
about the thing is the idea there is
54:50
that
54:51
for a long time
54:53
many plants are grown using chemicals
54:56
or man-made products but sometimes this
54:59
might be unhealthy those chemicals might
55:01
not be good for our bodies so now people
55:04
are more concerned or are interested in
55:08
foods that are grown completely
55:10
naturally
55:11
with no chemicals no man-made chemicals
55:15
and we call that type of food organic
55:20
nothing unnatural was used to make these
55:23
plants no unnatural chemicals for
55:25
example
55:27
okay next one different from everything
55:29
else so and this is a good example
55:32
because this is what we call a finger
55:36
print and if you think about it
55:40
i have a print on my finger right you
55:42
have a print on your finger but if we
55:44
put them here side by side they will be
55:47
different why
55:48
because everybody has a unique
55:52
unique means one of a kind you're the
55:55
only person
55:57
with that fingerprint in the world
55:59
isn't that interesting right of course
56:02
um
56:03
police use fingerprints to find
56:06
criminals right so maybe it's not great
56:08
but of course you're not a you will you
56:11
won't do anything bad but think about
56:13
that the fingerprint that you have on
56:14
your finger is different from your
56:16
sister it's different from your brother
56:17
is different from your mom or your dad
56:19
you are unique only you have that
56:22
certain pattern on your fingers you are
56:24
unique and not just in fingerprints but
56:27
in many other ways too
56:29
okay the next word is this ojim malio io
56:32
is my pronunciation okay that's a
56:34
difficult word for me to pronounce but
56:36
if you have to go to the bathroom if you
56:39
have to go to the bathroom where we go
56:40
to the bathroom you use this device here
56:44
it's kind of like an appliance what do
56:46
we call it we call it a toilet so i need
56:50
to use the toilet is very common i need
56:52
to use the toilet now some people when
56:55
they're in a department store or they're
56:57
in a movie theater and you need to use a
56:59
toilet some people might say excuse me
57:01
where is the toilet now in that case
57:04
they might be talking about the room
57:06
maybe they don't have to use the toilet
57:07
maybe they just want to wash their face
57:09
or or change their clothes right for
57:12
some reason
57:14
in that case you can also say where is
57:16
the rest
57:18
room
57:20
or where is the
57:22
bath
57:23
room
57:25
it's actually
57:27
it's actually more polite
57:29
to say where is the restroom than to say
57:32
where is the toilet so if you want to be
57:34
polite it's better to say where is the
57:36
restroom you can say bathroom but most
57:39
common for public places we say excuse
57:42
me where is the restroom and then you
57:44
can tell your friend i have to use the
57:46
toilet but
57:48
you know it's more polite to say
57:50
restroom anyway so but we use the toilet
57:53
in the restroom next word
57:55
okay now in this word we have water
57:57
going from a high place to a
58:00
lower place it's a lot of water and
58:02
we're talking about a lot of water not a
58:04
little water but a lot of water like a
58:06
river right or a large stream
58:10
going from a high place to a low place
58:13
and it's a very easy word when you think
58:15
about it because we're talking about
58:16
water what does the water do it's
58:19
falling so we say it's a waterfall very
58:22
easy word right water water fall
58:26
waterfall it's not a verb it's a noun a
58:29
waterfall and there are many famous
58:31
waterfalls in the world
58:33
okay
58:35
done with no mistakes wow look at that a
58:38
plus big percent choil right so done
58:41
with no mistakes what do we call that we
58:43
say he did it
58:45
perfectly
58:46
now l-y means it's an adjective i'm
58:50
sorry adverb and that defines the verb
58:54
so he
58:56
uh
58:57
did
58:58
it
59:00
perfect
59:03
lee because perfectly we're describing
59:06
how did he do it
59:08
right but we can also use just the word
59:11
perfect
59:12
his
59:14
score
59:16
is
59:18
perfect
59:20
now in this case it's an adjective
59:23
because we're talking about a noun we're
59:25
describing a noun his score is perfect
59:28
he did it perfectly okay so that's the
59:32
difference using l y are we describing
59:34
the verb or are we describing the noun
59:37
how did you do on your last test did you
59:39
do it perfectly did you have a perfect
59:42
score i hope so okay let's move on a
59:46
hard cover for some sea animals do you
59:49
like to go to the beach on the beach
59:51
when you're walking along you have the
59:52
water and the sand and right next to
59:54
where the water comes you can find many
59:57
hard coverings these are parts of
59:59
animals right they're not stones
60:02
they're parts of animals animals made
60:04
those what do we call them we call them
60:07
sea shells and as you can see they can
60:10
be very beautiful and different designs
60:13
and some people like to collect them
60:15
okay but try not to collect too much of
60:17
them in some places because the next
60:19
person who goes there there's no
60:21
seashells so sometimes it's best just to
60:23
leave things in nature and just look at
60:26
it appreciate it but leave it there for
60:28
the next person to come and enjoy it too
60:31
okay but seashells
60:33
okay next one
60:34
a long floor that goes up
60:37
unfortunately there are people who are
60:39
handicapped they
60:41
cannot move
60:43
normally so we need to
60:46
help them and one way to help them is
60:48
like this if you look at this boy you
60:51
think how can he go upstairs if there's
60:53
a building and there are only stairs in
60:55
the building
60:56
it's very terrible for him how does he
60:59
get into the building so many buildings
61:01
will build these long floors that go up
61:04
to help handicap people who are in
61:07
wheelchairs
61:08
we call these areas ramps they're a ramp
61:11
it's a nice gentle slope that you can go
61:14
up in a wheelchair or for other people
61:17
maybe older people or people who are
61:19
injured and they have a hard time they
61:21
can go up the ramp more easily than
61:23
other people who just climb up the
61:25
stairs
61:26
okay the next one
61:28
the act of finding new information
61:31
so this is what scientists do all the
61:34
time they're trying to find new
61:36
information so they do research
61:40
usually when we talk about research of
61:42
course scientists do a lot of research
61:44
but many other people do research too
61:47
right uh professors at the university if
61:50
their if their subject is literature
61:52
they're researching the old text about
61:55
maybe william shakespeare or some other
61:57
famous uh author from a long time ago
62:01
if you are an artist you will do
62:04
research by researching famous painters
62:07
in history or
62:09
famous painters or new modern trends in
62:12
painting when you find new information
62:14
you are doing research and be careful
62:17
here research is a non-count noun
62:21
people do research we don't do
62:23
researches we do research okay so the
62:27
scientists have a lot of inch are doing
62:30
a lot of interesting research it's
62:33
non-count don't put an s on the end of
62:35
it or yes
62:37
okay
62:38
now let's review the words that we have
62:40
just learned and uh with some exercises
62:42
the instructions are choose the word
62:45
that best completes the sentence these
62:47
are our words we need to find one
62:50
the best one to put into these blanks
62:53
number one
62:55
you should beep more in school
62:59
somebody's always telling you this right
63:01
sorry
63:02
you don't work hard enough okay so
63:05
you should what in more in school you
63:08
should influence more in school you
63:10
should influence your friends that
63:11
doesn't make sense you should allow
63:13
allow that doesn't make allow what uh
63:15
you should sleep more yes that's it you
63:18
should sleep more in school no
63:21
absolutely not i'm sorry
63:23
i didn't say that shh okay
63:25
you should achieve more in school that
63:27
makes sense okay that's the right one
63:29
don't sleep more in school okay i'm just
63:31
kidding
63:32
you should achieve more in school in
63:35
other words you if somebody doesn't work
63:37
hard enough let's say your friend
63:39
is a little lazy they don't study hard
63:41
enough they get bad grades on their on
63:44
their tests
63:45
you could say you don't achieve
63:47
enough you should achieve more in school
63:51
you don't work hard enough okay so work
63:53
harder achieve more
63:56
okay number two
63:59
now don't forget number one you should
64:00
achieve more in school okay number two
64:02
that lady is beep she should be a movie
64:05
star when you watch the movies when you
64:08
when you look at the movies these days
64:10
normally movies aren't really real right
64:13
the people in the movies are always
64:15
very good looking right
64:18
especially it's interesting when you
64:19
look at movies that are based on a true
64:21
story right and you look at the actors
64:24
the actors are always usually much
64:26
better looking than the people who the
64:29
story is based on right that's very
64:30
interesting but that's part of
64:32
entertainment so what what can we say
64:34
that lady is beyond
64:37
beyond means she's further away that
64:39
doesn't make sense
64:40
she is beautiful ah she's beautiful
64:43
that's probably the right answer she she
64:46
is achieved you can't say somebody is
64:48
achieve achieve is a verb not an
64:50
adjective so that doesn't make sense
64:52
that lady is perfectly no remember
64:55
perfectly describes a verb not a noun
64:58
so
64:59
that wouldn't work if you said that lady
65:00
is perfect that could be an answer but
65:03
this is perfect lee so it doesn't fit
65:05
grammatically
65:06
the best answer of course is beautiful
65:08
like i said before that's probably your
65:10
answer that lady is beautiful she should
65:13
be a movie star because
65:16
when we look at movies usually the
65:18
beautiful people are the movie stars
65:20
that's changing recently nowadays there
65:23
are more and more people who look like
65:25
real people in the movies and that's
65:26
maybe a good thing too because it really
65:29
should be based on talent not beauty
65:31
okay
65:33
three
65:34
the road beep up ahead be ready to turn
65:37
remember when i talked about this i said
65:39
if the road is straight
65:41
you don't have to be so careful but if
65:43
the road it does this right you have to
65:46
be ready to turn right so what does the
65:49
road do does the road influences does it
65:52
achieves does it curves does it fits
65:55
the road
65:57
of course curves up ahead the road
66:00
curves so be ready to turn
66:02
remember a curve can be to the right
66:04
or inchokuro or it can be to the left
66:07
when chokoro or jayajan right um still
66:10
learning my korean okay so it can curve
66:13
either direction to the right or to the
66:15
left be ready to turn turn right or turn
66:17
left
66:18
okay
66:20
four
66:21
do you beep what the homework is for
66:24

66:25
so if your teacher gave you some
66:27

66:28
right and you were sleeping
66:31

66:33

66:37
friend do you know what the homework is
66:39
for tonight do you know what the
66:40
homework is for tonight you wouldn't say
66:42
do you chance that's not right do you
66:44
believe that doesn't fit and do you
66:47
research no do you know if you have the
66:50
information in your head you have the
66:52
answer in your head then you know it if
66:55
you don't have the answer in your head
66:58
you're going to try to find it then you
66:59
will research it but we don't say do you
67:02
research we say do you know because we
67:04
want to know do you know the information
67:06
or don't you know the information do you
67:09
know
67:09
what the homework is for tonight and we
67:12
can use many words here do you know how
67:16

67:18

67:21

67:24
of these question words here after do
67:27
you know
67:28
and we want to know if you know that
67:30
information or not do you know how to
67:32
get to school do you know where i live
67:35
do you know when
67:36
the test is do you know why we're having
67:40
a test do you know who our teacher is
67:43
right if you know this information you
67:45
can use these question words after do
67:47
you know to find
67:49
out that information from your friends
67:51
okay let's continue
67:53
no do you know what the homework is for
67:55
tonight okay next one number five
67:58
many people go to the new museum every
68:01
year so when you go to a museum you go
68:03
there for a short time you don't live
68:05
there you don't stay there you go there
68:07
for a short time and then you leave so
68:10
what types of
68:12
what can we describe that situation many
68:15
environments environments don't go to
68:18
museums right visitors ah visitors go
68:22
for a short time that's our answer many
68:24
visitors go to the new museum every year
68:27
not faster not sea seashells go to the
68:30
museum
68:31
maybe there might be an exhibit on the
68:34
uh about seashells but they don't go
68:35
there every year that's kind of silly
68:38
okay let's move on to number six
68:41
where i live the beep is cold and snowy
68:46
so we're talking about
68:48
the area around you it can also be just
68:51
around you or around your house it's the
68:54
area in which you live is cold and snowy
68:56
that's the space that surrounds you what
68:58
word is that the furniture is cold and
69:01
snowy furniture can't be snowy furniture
69:04
can be cold but not snowy
69:06
the the visitor is cold and snowy that
69:09
doesn't make sense the environments ah
69:12
the environment the space around you
69:14
like the country around you is cold and
69:17
snowy maybe you live far in the north
69:19
the environment is cold and snowy
69:22
not the influence so where i live the
69:24
environment is cold and snowy okay let's
69:28
move on to number seven
69:30
all the beep in our house is made of
69:33
wood so what do you have inside your
69:35
house
69:36
that might be made of wood and it's
69:38
typically usually made of wood think
69:41
about your bed think about your chair
69:43
think about your table your desk right
69:46
these things what do we call these
69:48
things we call them inside no do we call
69:51
them visitors no people are not made of
69:53
wood
69:54
okay
69:55
do we call them furniture yes we call
69:57
them furniture all the furniture in our
70:00
house is made of wood not all the
70:02
beautiful beautiful is an adjective not
70:04
a noun it doesn't fit so the best one is
70:08
furniture all the furniture in our house
70:11
is made of wood and that's typical
70:14
usually furniture is made of wood number
70:17
eight my teacher beep me in a good way i
70:21
work harder now so if your teacher has
70:24
done something
70:26
to change your behavior so that you work
70:29
harder now what did your teacher do did
70:31
your teacher visitor you that doesn't
70:33
make sense grammatically did your
70:35
teacher achieves you
70:37
again that doesn't make sense
70:38
grammatically your teacher knows you in
70:41
a good way
70:43
that's a little strange
70:44
your teacher influences ah your teacher
70:48
influences me in a good way it changed
70:52
my behavior in a good way
70:55
okay so that's the answer there my
70:57
teacher influences me in a good way now
70:59
i work harder so people who inspire you
71:02
people who you want to follow or copy
71:05
they may influence you to change your
71:07
behavior or the way that you think
71:09
okay well that wraps it up for the
71:10
vocabulary section let's take a short
71:12
break and we'll start with the reading
71:14
section soon don't go away
71:26
[Music]
71:44
hello everybody welcome back to reading
71:46
for vocabulary are you ready to continue
71:49
talking about our subject of sports well
71:52
we're on lesson four the human machine
71:56
the human machine
71:57
it's like people are machines right
72:00
think about some famous athletes that
72:02
you know right like pak ji sang or or
72:05
pak taiwan right the swimmer they're
72:07
like machines in the water or on the
72:09
soccer field right
72:12
how do they get to be such strong
72:14
athletes that's what we're going to
72:16
focus on how can someone become a great
72:19
athlete well of course it's going to
72:21
take a lot of hard work right but in the
72:23
reading passage we'll take a look at how
72:26
someone becomes a great athlete and if
72:29
you want to become a great athlete what
72:31
can you do to become a great athlete so
72:34
we're going to take a look at that but
72:36
first as always let's take a look at the
72:39
vocabulary so our first vocabulary word
72:43
is
72:44
someone who plays a sport
72:46
we just talked about that right
72:49
how can someone become a great what what
72:51
is this person she is running she is an
72:55
athlete she is an athlete okay so
72:58
pronunciation athlete
73:00
if you compete in a sport and that's
73:03
like your not just your hobby but also
73:06
sometimes your job you're an athlete if
73:08
you play sports well and you do it a lot
73:11
okay
73:12
the ability to do something the ability
73:15
to do something like if you have the
73:17
ability to create such a beautiful sand
73:19
castle right we can say you have a lot
73:23
of skill
73:24
of course athletes need skill right
73:27
but also many other types of people need
73:30
skill artists need skill engineers need
73:34
skill lawyers need skill skill is
73:38
something it's an ability that you
73:40
develop either through training through
73:43
practice through study but it's a skill
73:46
what kind of skills do you have for
73:48
example
73:49
okay number three
73:51
here's a signpost right the measure of
73:54
space between two things right buenos
73:56
aires is 7
73:58
270 kilometers that way so when we
74:01
measure the space between two things
74:04
we're talking about the distance how far
74:09
something is away so from me to buenos
74:12
aires or me to busan right what is the
74:16
distance
74:17
how many kilometers or how many miles
74:20
right okay
74:23
next one after some time
74:26
so when we look at this what is this by
74:28
the way this is a tad pole
74:31
now
74:32
later on this tadpole we know maybe you
74:35
know what will it become it will become
74:37
a frog right
74:39
river okay so but it will take some time
74:42
eventually eventually means after
74:46
a certain amount of time usually kind of
74:48
like a long time this tadpole is not
74:51
going to become a frog right away it's
74:54
going to take some time eventually the
74:57
tadpole will become a frog eventually
75:00
young children will grow up to be adults
75:03
it'll take some time but eventually it
75:06
will happen after some time okay
75:10
number five repeating something so you
75:13
get better at it now your english
75:15
teacher probably always tells you this
75:18
what do they say they say practice
75:20
practice practice okay it's not just
75:22
english piano right if you're learning
75:26
to play a musical instrument
75:29
whether it's a piano a trumpet or
75:31
whatever you have to practice
75:33
if you're playing a sport and you want
75:35
to get better at it what do you do you
75:37
practice so any skill remember we talked
75:40
about skills skills our abilities how do
75:43
you improve your ability you practice
75:46
whatever it is you practice you get
75:49
better at it so do it again and again
75:51
repeating it so that you get better at
75:54
it okay next one number six
75:57
equal
75:58
and even if something is equal and even
76:01
we say it is balanced right it is
76:03
perfectly balanced because it's equal
76:06
and it is even on both sides it's
76:09
balanced sometimes well a little bit
76:12
different idea we can also say it's fair
76:14
if two teams two soccer teams are
76:16
playing one team has 12 players the
76:19
other team has eight players it's not
76:21
balanced it's not fair
76:23
so both teams have to have 11 players
76:26
and that's a balanced
76:29
team that is a fair competition okay
76:32
next one seven
76:35
done all the way so if something is
76:38
um
76:39
finished or if all the things are in
76:42
place we say that it is complete it or
76:45
something is done all the way something
76:47
has finished a process you can think
76:50
about complete in different ways in this
76:52
case we're thinking all the tools are in
76:54
a sets or everything is together it's
76:57
complete but you can also think about a
76:59
painting when the painting is finished
77:01
we say it is complete it's finished okay
77:07
eight
77:08
now this is very interesting isn't it
77:09
this is from this is how a butterfly
77:12
comes out of the cocoon remember before
77:15
it was a caterpillar
77:16
so a caterpillar changes into a new
77:19
state into a butterfly what do we say
77:22
we say becomes a caterpillar becomes
77:26
a butterfly a caterpillar becomes a
77:30
butterfly a child becomes an adult a
77:35
tadpole becomes a frog and become is an
77:39
irregular verb so we say become became
77:43
become okay
77:45
become became become it's interesting
77:48
that this is the same as the present
77:50
tense right the past perfect okay
77:53
next one nine
77:55
there are many books here italy turkey
77:57
beijing mexico india what are these
78:00
books about they tell you
78:02
how to do something they tell you how to
78:05
travel through italy they tell you how
78:07
to travel through mexico what is it it
78:10
is a guide these books are guides to
78:14
different cities
78:16
but a guide can be many different things
78:18
a guide can be a book
78:20
a guide can be a person right if you're
78:23
on a tour there's a tour guide who tells
78:26
you and shows you the different places
78:28
and how to look at them or or how to
78:30
think sometimes about these places or
78:33
what to know
78:34
so a guide can be many different types
78:37
of things it shows you how to do
78:39
something a guide could also be an
78:41
instruction manual you get a computer
78:44
and you need to how do i you know hook
78:46
up all the cables you look at the guide
78:48
okay
78:50
10.
78:51

79:23
pronunciation for an important mineral
79:26

79:37
things very important for you
79:39
number 11 this is not so important for
79:42

79:47
bodies having a lot of sugar
79:50

79:53
like gummy gummy candy of course it's
79:56
very sugary
79:58
chocolate has a lot of sugar in it um
80:01
hard candy all very sugary treats and
80:05
snacks so be careful of those our body
80:08

80:10
important for our body especially our
80:12
teeth got to be careful just mail okay
80:14

the ability to do difficult things
82:44
strength if somebody has a lot of
82:46
strength they have the ability to do
82:48
difficult things i don't think this this
82:51
is real it's a trick photography but
82:54
think about it if you can lift a lot of
82:56
things if you can pick up a very heavy
82:58
weight you have a lot of strength
83:01
okay so those are the words we need to
83:03
know for the reading
83:05
let's make sure we remember those words
83:07
let's take a little short quiz on some
83:09
of those words choose the word that best
83:12
completes the sentence here are the
83:14
words we need to fill in the blanks with
83:16
the best word okay
83:18
number one you need to beep your english
83:22
if you want to get better we talked
83:24
about this it's not just english it
83:26
could be practicing
83:28
a musical instrument like the piano the
83:31
trumpet or whatever
83:33
what do you need to do do you need to
83:35
define
83:37
do you need to become
83:38
do you need to practice or do you need
83:40
to skill well skill right away we see
83:43
that's a noun that doesn't make sense
83:45
define become practice those are verbs
83:48
and they would fit with two right two we
83:51
need a verb but define become practice
83:54
if you want to get better at something
83:56
you need to do it again and again you
83:58
need to practice right you need to
84:00
practice your english if you want to get
84:03
better you need to practice playing
84:06
soccer if you want to get better at

want to become my homegirl i want to
84:37
become a book that's crazy
84:40
i want to drop my homework or i want to
84:43
complete my homework what makes sense
84:45
well obviously if you looked at complete
84:47
that's the one that makes sense complete
84:49
means finish i want to complete my
84:52
homework i want to finish my homework
84:54
before i can go to the movies not put
84:56
not become and not drop you know drop
85:00
your homework let's see let's go
85:01
upstairs and drop it from the roof no
85:03
don't do that okay that's not a good
85:05
idea you want to complete your homework
85:08
before you can go to the movies okay
85:10
next one three you're so good at base
85:14
basketball oh baseball sorry baseball
85:16
you're so good that means ah chale right
85:19
you're so good at it right you should be
85:22
a professional what
85:24
if a person plays a sport especially for
85:27
their job they get paid for it they are
85:30
professional and they are playing a
85:33
sport and they're getting paid for it
85:35
what do we call that job doctor lawyer
85:38
engineer or what skill train athlete
85:41
event which one of these words is a
85:44
description of an actual job well of
85:47
course c
85:48
an athlete is a description of a
85:50
particular job an athlete is someone who
85:53
plays a sport a professional athlete is
85:57
someone who plays a sport and gets money
85:59
for it
86:00
right you think about it that's crazy
86:02
right somebody gets paid for throwing a
86:04
ball or running fast well in our society
86:07
it's true people some people get paid a
86:10
lot of money
86:11
to uh to to play these games like for
86:14
example think of tiger woods he gets
86:17
millions of dollars for playing golf
86:19
sounds like a dream job right of course
86:21
they have a lot of talent they have a
86:23
lot of skill and they've worked very
86:25
hard to attain that skill
86:28
okay number four
86:29
in a few days the seed will beep a plant
86:33
so again a seed of course is like an
86:35
apple seed or
86:37
some other
86:38
part of the plant that you put in the
86:40
ground and then after a while it
86:42
eventually grows into a plant right
86:45
so first you have a seed
86:47
later you have a plant right what
86:49
happens to the seed it what
86:52
it completes it becomes it eventually
86:55
or it guides
86:57
of course we know the answer oops
87:00
the answer is become in a few days the
87:02
seed will become a plant
87:04
so it will change from one thing
87:07
to another thing it will become a plant
87:10
okay so
87:11
let's move on to number five
87:14
that beep is too great no one could ever
87:17
swim that far
87:19
okay so we we kind of know the answer
87:22
right here if you're looking at wow
87:23
there's an island out there be careful
87:25
it's very far away
87:26
right that what is too great that event
87:30
that guide that incredible or that
87:32
distance
87:33
is too great remember the the
87:36
measurement from point a
87:38
here to point b over there we're talking
87:41
about distance
87:43
so we say that distance is too great the
87:46
distance is too great no one could ever
87:50
swim that far the distance is too great
87:53
so the right answer is distance
87:56
six your english
87:58
beep has improved a lot
88:00
all that practice has paid off so again
88:04
we're kind of talking about that idea
88:05
again practice you practice something a
88:08
lot to improve what do you want to
88:10
improve
88:12
you improve your ability at something
88:14
what is ability skill repeat grow or
88:18
learn did you say skill
88:20
then you would be correct because skill
88:22
is ability you practice a skill to
88:26
become better at it your english skill
88:28
has improved a lot
88:30
all that practice has paid off
88:33
practice has paid off means you
88:35
practiced a lot
88:37
so you got the reward you were
88:39
successful right if something is
88:41
successful it has paid off you were
88:44
successful
88:46
okay number seven
88:48
beep i will usually i will start eating
88:50
better just not right now so not right
88:54
now not now
88:56
some other time later what mean what
88:59
does that mean what what
89:01
mean what what word within the blank a
89:04
usually i will start eating better
89:06
usually i will start eating better that
89:08
doesn't make sense because usually
89:10
is for
89:11
things that happen habitually so we
89:13
don't use future tense with usually
89:16
completely i will start eating better
89:18
that doesn't make sense suddenly i will
89:20
start eating better that's isaan hail
89:22
eventually ah eventually not right now
89:24
but later so eventually is the answer
89:28
eventually not now but after some time
89:31
eventually i will start eating better
89:35
a lot of us we sometimes lazy so we say
89:37
eventually i'll do it i'll do it
89:39
eventually okay but not right now okay
89:42
maybe you should start right now if you
89:44
want to do something do it now don't
89:46
wait for eventually do it now
89:48
okay
89:49
eight a or add beep meal will keep you
89:53
healthy
89:54
we talk about eating we have to eat
89:57
certain things right a different things
90:00
we have to eat a certain amount of
90:01
carbohydrates or bread and potatoes and
90:04
rice
90:05
right we have to eat a certain amount of
90:06
protein like in meat we have to eat a
90:09
certain amount of we have to drink a
90:11
certain amount of other things like milk
90:13
or cheese dairy products okay so we have
90:16
to make sure we eat all these things and
90:18
in the right parts right so
90:21
what kind of meal should we have all
90:23
meat no we need meat vegetables
90:26
something to drink
90:27
you know we need a what kind of meal a
90:29
balanced meal a sugary meal an exercise
90:32
meal or an energy meal
90:35
well right away we know sugary meal will
90:37
not keep us healthy that's got too much
90:39
sugar in it an exercise meal doesn't
90:42
make sense because we're looking for an
90:44
adjective right
90:46
something to modify meal exercise is not
90:49
an adjective and energy is an adjective
90:52
an energy meal but that doesn't sound
90:54
right that doesn't make sense what we're
90:56
looking for is balanced a balanced meal
90:58
a balanced meal has the right amount of
91:01
each food group and you eat it and it's
91:04
good for you because it's balanced you
91:06
get enough protein you get carbohydrates
91:09
you get enough vitamins and minerals
91:12
it's a balanced meal and it keeps you
91:14
healthy not too much sugar right maybe a
91:16
little sugar is okay but not too much
91:18
you need to eat the things in balance
91:21
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
91:23
section let's take a short break here
91:25
and we'll come back and look at the
91:26
reading how to become a great athlete so
91:29
don't go away we'll be right back
91:40

92:17
about sports in this lesson and we're
92:20
going to be focusing on the ancient
92:22
olympics so let's learn about the
92:26
history of the olympics so you know
92:29
about the olympics right the olympics
92:32
where every country in the world
92:34
competes and there's television and you
92:36
can watch it on tv and you can cheer for
92:40
your own nation of course that happens
92:42
every four years but we're not talking
92:46
about the modern olympics we're talking
92:48
about the ancient olympics in this
92:51
lesson ancient means a long long time
92:55
ago
92:56
thousands of years ago before television
93:00
right before many nations in the world
93:04
there was the ancient olympics and these
93:07
were held in greece okay athletes
93:11
athletes from different
93:13
cities in ancient greece would get
93:16
together and they would compete they
93:19
would have a contest in many different
93:21
sports
93:23
where would they do it they would do it
93:25
under mount olympus mount olympus is
93:30
where the greeks thought the gods lived
93:33
at the top of the mountain and the
93:35
mountain was called olympus and so they
93:38
called it the olympic games and like i
93:41
said from many different cities in
93:43
greece the athletes would come and
93:45
compete and of course ancient greece is
93:48
very famous right for not only many old
93:52
buildings and many impressive and
93:55
beautiful
93:56
structures but also because of their
93:58
culture and their way of thinking but
94:01
they were the ones who created the
94:03
olympics in the beginning thousands of
94:05
years ago the ancient olympics so that's
94:08
what we're going to read about in this
94:10
lesson but before we do that let's learn
94:14
some vocabulary okay and our first word
94:17
is a person who is very famous of course
94:23
you know many people who are famous
94:25
singers actors on television actors in
94:29
the movie what do we call these people
94:32
it starts with a c
94:34
it is
94:35
celebrity
94:36
celebrity is a person who is very very
94:41
famous and everybody knows who that
94:43
person is
94:45
okay what's the next word the next word
94:48
is a bird no it's not a bird it's a
94:51
thing or idea that can represent another
94:54
idea the example is a bird the example
94:58
is a dove when people see a dove what do
95:02
they think of they think of peace so the
95:05
dove is a symbol
95:08
a symbol of peace so if you can look at
95:12
animals you can look at flags the teguki
95:16
the korean flag is a symbol for korea
95:19
right so it's a thing or idea that can
95:23
represent another idea right so this
95:27
thing here the dove represents the idea
95:30
of peace okay next word
95:33
whoa he's very angry be careful joshua
95:37
right he's looks like very very uh
95:40
dangerous dog right strong and dangerous
95:44
right joshua hale so what is the word
95:46
that we use we use
95:49
it's not dog it's fierce
95:52
okay
95:52
fierce now i have a dog a beagle but
95:56
she's not fierce she's very lovable and
95:59
cute but this dog joshua right this dog
96:02
is very fierce strong and dangerous
96:06
okay next one
96:08
four
96:09
no smoking to let someone do something
96:13
to let someone do something is to allow
96:16
them to do something but if you have a
96:19
sign that says no smoking this would be
96:22
not allow someone to do something so the
96:25
picture and the word a little bit
96:27
mismatched but that's okay because
96:30
if we allow people to smoke here then
96:33
there's no sign right that means we let
96:36
them do something if your mother lets
96:39
you play video games after dinner then
96:42
she's allowing you to do that but do
96:45
your homework first okay okay
96:47
next one
96:48
ah a race to be part of a race or other
96:52
competition
96:54
what do we say we say it is compete to
96:58
be part this is a verb right because you
97:01
are part of a race or other competition
97:05
if you are in a race or another
97:09
competition it doesn't have to be a race
97:11
it could be a chess game maybe a chess
97:14
tournament or it could be a soccer game
97:18
right it could be anything where you
97:21
compete compete is a verb you it's like
97:25
you're not really fighting against
97:27
somebody but you're using your skill
97:30
against another person to win
97:33
you are competing okay and of course
97:35
compete is a verb and we have
97:37
competition right competition is the
97:41
noun and competition is a game or any
97:44
other contest where you use your skill
97:47
to win
97:48
okay next one
97:50
a feeling of doing well
97:52
so others can see a feeling of doing
97:56
well so others can see we say this is
98:00
pride right if he's on the football team
98:03
he's very young football player he won
98:06
right he has the trophy his team
98:08
won
98:09
the competition so he
98:12
has a lot of pride he has pride but be
98:16
careful he is proud so pride is the noun
98:22
we can say
98:25
he
98:26
shows
98:28
his pride
98:32
in this case pride is a noun but
98:35
be careful we can also say he is
98:38
proud which is also very common but in
98:41
this case proud is an adjective right
98:45
this is
98:46
noun okay so he shows his pride or he
98:50
has
98:51
pride
98:52
next he is
98:54
proud adjective so be careful with the
98:56
word form okay
98:59
next
99:00
more than normal if something is more
99:03
than normal what do we say we say
99:05
especially especially is kind of like
99:08
when you want to point out something in
99:12
particular some special case right
99:16
then we use especially okay
99:19
to go somewhere well perhaps when you're
99:22
older you can travel around the world
99:24
like this young girl is doing here she's
99:27
traveling looks like she's in france in
99:29
paris to go somewhere is to travel right
99:33
to travel you can travel around the
99:36
world
99:37
next
99:38
one this is a sport where athletes wear
99:42
gloves and hit each other you know this
99:44
sport right you've seen this before
99:46
these guys are being safe they're
99:48
wearing gloves and they're wearing a
99:50
padded helmet right what are they doing
99:53
right they're doing this sport it's not
99:55
wrestling not wrestling it is
99:58
boxing
100:00
boxing
100:01
now be careful boxing is a noun it's the
100:05
name of the sport a few days ago i was
100:09
in my neighborhood and i saw a poster
100:12
somebody opened a boxing gym and they
100:15
wanted to be funny do you know the movie
100:18
shall we dance
100:19
well they used that idea for the movie
100:22
title and on their on their poster they
100:25
put shall we boxing and i thought what
100:28
shall we boxing no
100:30
it should be
100:31
shall
100:33
we
100:34
box
100:37
because box is a verb
100:40
boxing is a noun right the movie is not
100:44
called shall we dancing no shall we
100:47
dance shall we box okay because box is
100:51
the verb so be careful again of the word
100:54
form ing is a noun boxing
100:58
i like boxing can you box okay next word
101:04
parts of a plant tied together in a
101:07
circle at christmas time we can see
101:10
these many people put them on their
101:13
doors they hang them on their doors it's
101:15
like happy christmas or merry christmas
101:17
right we call it a wreath okay but it's
101:21
not just for christmas
101:23
wreaths can be used for other occasions
101:26
but most common people think of a wreath
101:29
at christmas time this is a christmas
101:32
wreath but we'll see another kind of
101:34
wreath in the reading okay next one
101:37
oh don't look poncho
101:39
no i'm just kidding
101:41
right because it's
101:44
all right a little baby right but
101:47
usually babies they don't wear any
101:49
clothes it's obviously of course when
101:51
they're first born they're not wearing
101:53
clothes right so what do we say they are
101:56
naked
101:57
we come into this world naked right we
102:02
come into the world naked and
102:05
usually not so peaceful but this baby is
102:08
very peaceful very cute right so not
102:10
wearing any clothes somebody is naked
102:12
we'll see that in the reading okay next
102:15
one
102:17
being a girl or woman not male so if we
102:21
talk about you know there's there's
102:22
about fifty percent of the people in the
102:25
world are one sex or the other sex right
102:28
there's male and then there's
102:31
female female right so male and female
102:36
basically everybody in the world is
102:38
either male or female so about maybe a
102:41
little more than half
102:42
of the people in the world are female
102:45
okay so being a girl woman not male
102:48
next one
102:50
of course this is korea and you probably
102:53
know where this is the dmz right an
102:55
agreement that all fighting is stopped
102:58
right it's just an agreement and maybe
103:00
the fighting has stopped for just a
103:02
short time but there hasn't been a
103:04
formal agreement to stop it forever
103:07
right that's what korea is under right
103:09
now a truce you know south korea and
103:12
north korea they never had a peace
103:14
agreement they're just under a truce
103:18
technically they're still at war right
103:21
but they have had a truce for more than
103:23
60 years
103:24
so a truce is just a it's like a
103:26
temporary uh stop to the fighting
103:29
hopefully it will be permanent but
103:32
a truce and it's not just in korea
103:35
anywhere in the world where two
103:37
groups are fighting and they say let's
103:39
have a truce that means a temporary a
103:42
short period where there's no fighting
103:45
okay
103:47
a flat piece of metal given as a prize
103:49
he's proud too right he is proud he has
103:53
pride because why he has a medal
103:57
if you do something great whether in
103:59
school or you uh in sports you win a
104:02
game or you win a tournament
104:05
they might give you a medal soldiers
104:08
wear metals on their chest right so a
104:11
metal is a small piece of metal it's
104:14
usually decorated looks nice and it's
104:17
given as a prize it shows you were
104:21
excellent in doing something
104:23
okay
104:25
next one is to shout for something good
104:28
i talked about this before of course
104:30
it's to cheer when i talked about the
104:32
olympics i say you cheer for your
104:35
country don't you of course when you
104:37
watch the olympics every four years you
104:40

104:48

104:52

104:57
next one a box that shows us moving
104:59
pictures a box that shows it what what
105:01
is that
105:02
i've have you ever seen one of those
105:04
before what could that be
105:07
oh it's a television of course
105:09
very common i'm just kidding of course
105:11
everybody knows what a television is
105:14
it's like a box well not anymore
105:16
it used to be a box now it's a very thin
105:19
screen right but it used to be like a
105:21
big box that was very heavy but
105:23
thankfully technology has moved on so
105:26
anyway television you're watching a
105:28
video screen right now maybe you're
105:30
watching this on television you're
105:32
probably watching it on your computer
105:34
screen but anyway television is where
105:36
you watch tv shows and movies okay
105:40
let's move on let's go over the
105:44
words the vocabulary okay let's see how
105:46
well you remember these words choose the
105:49
word that best completes the sentence we
105:51
have words down here we have a blank we
105:53
need to complete the sentence with these
105:56
words let's take a look i won't be
105:59
you to leave you haven't done your
106:02
homework
106:03
so mom says this when the the boy or
106:06
girl wants to go out and play but mom
106:08
says i won't
106:11
what you to leave you need to stay here
106:14
and finish your homework you haven't
106:16
done your homework you need to stay here
106:18
do your homework and then you can leave
106:21
then i will beep you to leave what i
106:24
will give you to leave that doesn't make
106:26
sense i will honor you to leave
106:29
that doesn't make sense i will compete
106:31
you to leave or i will allow you to
106:35
leave aha allow sounds like it would be
106:38
a good choice right i won't allow you to
106:42
leave
106:42
that's the answer i won't allow you to
106:45
leave i won't let you leave because you
106:49
haven't done your homework when you
106:51
finish your homework then i will allow
106:54
you then you can go then you are able to
106:57
leave right i will give you permission
107:01
okay
107:01
number two
107:03
there is a beep storm outside let's stay

107:08
there's a storm outside it's raining or
107:11
it's snowing the wind is blowing very
107:13
strongly
107:15
it's very it could be dangerous strong
107:18
and dangerous so what can we say there
107:20
is a fierce storm
107:22
fierce means dangerous right strong and
107:24
dangerous right so there's a fierce
107:27
storm outside that sounds good let's
107:29
check the others there's a peaceful
107:31
storm oh peaceful it's very nice why
107:33
would we stay inside and have you ever
107:36
heard of a storm that is peaceful that
107:38
doesn't make sense
107:39
there is a rude storm
107:42
the wind's going by going yeah get out
107:43
of my way right that's crazy okay so c
107:47
doesn't work
107:48
d there's a slow storm outside let's
107:51
stay in in that's a little bit isang
107:53
hail the best word is fierce there's a
107:56
fierce storm outside let's stay in if
108:00
there's a fierce storm it means the wind
108:02
is blowing really strong it's very
108:05
dangerous okay so stay inside stay warm
108:09

108:37
does less no less doesn't mean really or
108:40
very b slowly that doesn't make sense c
108:43
quickly i was quickly tired today
108:46
that's strange
108:48
so d i was especially aha especially
108:51
means more than normal like very or
108:54
really i was especially tired today i
108:57
only slept for four hours so the answer
109:00
of course is especially i was especially
109:03
tired today
109:04
okay next one number four
109:07
that flag is the beep of our nation i
109:09
talked about this before right when we
109:11
saw the picture of the dove but i also
109:14
gave you another example i said the
109:16
teguki the korean flag is the beep of
109:19
korea just like the stars and stripes is
109:22
the beep for america right a flag is a
109:26
what a flag is a symbol of a nation so
109:30
that flag is the symbol of our nation
109:32
not the treat not the top not the
109:34
celebrity but the symbol you see it and
109:37
you think of something else it's the
109:40
symbol of our nation okay next one
109:43
number five i don't want to beep in the
109:46
soccer game maybe you feel sick or
109:49
you're injured so you don't want to play
109:52
soccer right you don't want to
109:54
participate what word means play in a
109:57
game or participate in a contest
110:01
i don't want to forget in the soccer
110:03
game that doesn't make sense because we
110:05
don't use forget and in
110:07
i don't want to compete in the soccer
110:09
game compete
110:11
remember compete means to use your
110:13
skills to try to win in a contest and
110:17
that's what they're doing so compete is
110:19
probably our word but let's just check
110:21
i don't want to enjoy in the soccer game
110:25
that doesn't make sense because again we
110:27
don't say enjoy in
110:30
if in bego in begohmian right if in was
110:33
gone right we could use i don't want to
110:36
forget the soccer game i don't want to
110:38
enjoy the soccer game those would make
110:41
sense but because of in they don't make
110:44
sense
110:45
i don't want to allow the soccer game
110:47
also if in was not there then we could
110:51
say yeah it's possible i don't want to
110:53
allow the soccer game it's too noisy
110:56
for example i don't want to allow it but
110:59
because of in
111:02
because of in this one this one this one
111:05
and this one they don't make sense the
111:07
only one that makes sense is compete we
111:09
compete in a game we compete in a
111:13
contest so that's a good thing to
111:15
remember when you use the word compete
111:18
use the preposition in i want to compete
111:22
in the soccer game i want to compete in
111:25
the chess tournament i want to compete
111:28
in the tennis championships you compete
111:32
in something okay number six
111:36
that singer is my favorite beep she is
111:39
so
111:40
famous right we talked about what do we
111:43
call very famous people
111:45
engineer no
111:47
well some engineers can be famous but
111:50
engineers aren't normally famous right a
111:53
veterinarian
111:54
no a veterinarian is just an animal
111:56
doctor not a famous person see a
111:58
celebrity aha that's the word we talked
112:01
about before someone who's very very
112:04
famous is a celebrity that's the answer
112:07
right and d doctor no because doctor is
112:11
very similar to veterinarian this one
112:13
this one and this one are names of
112:16
specific jobs engineer
112:19
builds buildings or make sure things are
112:22
working like machines and things like
112:24
that veterinarian is a doctor who takes
112:27
care of animals and of course a doctor
112:29
takes care of people they're just normal
112:31
jobs but a celebrity doesn't really mean
112:34
a job it means a person who is very
112:36
famous but it could be for anything
112:39
singing acting or for something
112:41
that they did that was bad right usually
112:44
celebrities are positive though right
112:47
somebody who's famous but we don't know
112:48
what they do for a job they're just very
112:51
famous

118:52
very impressive or very unusual things
118:56
to show their support for their home
118:58
team for their home team or whatever
119:01
team they're favorite of now of course
119:03
these are
119:04
international sporting events within the
119:07
nation inside of america for example
119:10
people won't dress their won't paint the
119:12
american flag on their bodies because
119:14
everybody's american but like the
119:16
chicago if somebody's from chicago and

119:19
the colors or paint their their bodies
119:22

119:24
home or city team
119:26
okay and they will do that or they're
119:28
aware of the jerseys the famous
119:30
jerseys jersey is the sports shirt that
119:32
the athlete wears with the number on the
119:34
back of their favorite player on that
119:37
team and that's what fans will do
119:38
they'll show their support okay well
119:41
before we go into the reading of course
119:43
we need to learn some vocabulary so
119:45
let's take a look at some vocabulary
119:46
having to do with supporting your
119:48
favorite team our first word is of
119:51
course
119:52
a group of people working together look
119:55
at these big guys here they're very big
119:57
aren't they they look strong they look
119:59
tough this of course is a football team
120:02
when i say football i mean american
120:04
football some of course europeans say
120:07
football is soccer they don't use the
120:09
word soccer but in america if you say
120:11
football you're talking about this
120:14
you're not talking about soccer you're
120:15
talking about wearing the helmet the
120:16
football throwing it it's a different
120:18
sport but anyway
120:20
whether it's football soccer or european
120:23
football what do you have you have a
120:25
group of people working together of
120:27
course we say that's a team and we
120:30
talked about that before you will
120:31
support your favorite team
120:34
next word beyond at a greater point so
120:37
if you're here and you want to go beyond
120:39
you want to go further down the road
120:42
the word of course is further you want
120:44
to go beyond you want to go
120:46
at a greater point than where you are
120:48
now
120:50
of course further doesn't just mean
120:51
distance it can also mean you know if
120:54
you want to uh improve your studies you
120:56
want to prove something further right or
120:59
you you have are are there any further
121:02
questions is another a very common
121:04
expression are there more questions are
121:06
there questions beyond right now that we
121:08
can explore these different areas so in
121:10
some cases we have different expressions
121:12
with further are there any further
121:14
questions
121:15
we have to go a little further okay of
121:18
course we can get confused with farther
121:20
if you say farther a are th er you're
121:23
only talking about distance farther we
121:26
have much farther to go today
121:28
okay
121:29
number three
121:31
a person who supports a team or a person
121:34
we talked about that right these people
121:36
who are dressed in different colors in
121:38
their team uh these people this is like
121:41
i said before this is inside america
121:44
they're not they're not dressed in the
121:45
national flag of america they're dressed
121:48
in the colors of their team probably
121:50
their college team and of course they're
121:52
called fans of course that's it right
121:55
here fan a fan is a person who is
121:58
supporting their team now you can have a
122:00
super fan
122:02
super fans most people are normal fans
122:04
right they cheer for their team they go
122:06
out but super fans they really go crazy
122:10
okay
122:10
okay number four a small tasty meal so
122:14
sometimes between breakfast and lunch
122:16
you get hungry
122:17
especially between lunch and dinner you
122:19
might get hungry what do you want you
122:21
want to eat a snack a snack
122:26
please remember that
122:27
snack is countable let's have a snack
122:31
not let's have snack no let's have a
122:35
snack did you have a snack
122:38
uh this afternoon okay what do you want
122:41
to have for a snack okay so snack is
122:44
countable in this case we say it's like
122:46
it's but even though if you have like
122:49
many pieces of fruit and maybe a candy
122:51
bar you call it all a snack so a snack
122:54
is kind of like the entire thing that
122:56
you eat
122:57
during that short time that's a snack
122:59
but usually it's just one thing like a
123:01
candy bar or a piece of fruit okay
123:05
number five to help or to hold up now if
123:08
you help somebody or if you're holding
123:10
something up what are you doing you are
123:12
supporting you're supporting that this
123:14
is what fans do fans support their teams
123:19
but you can also use support in many
123:21
different uh
123:23
ideas for example if a house is built on
123:25
a hill you might have like pillars
123:28
supporting the house right it just means
123:30
to hold something up so support can be
123:32
used in different ideas in this case
123:34
though we're talking about supporting a
123:37
team right you're showing your um your
123:40
energy or your support for that team
123:44
number six very serious and extreme if
123:48
something's very serious very extreme we
123:50
say it is intense sometimes of course at
123:54
the international level at the world cup
123:57
level soccer players are the best in the
123:59
world their play is very intense they're
124:03
very serious about their sport
124:05
and sometimes they do some extreme moves
124:09
right like maybe they kick backwards
124:11
right the goal is behind them they kick
124:13
and the ball goes behind them into the
124:14
gold that is extreme that's very intense
124:18
and of course as fans we like to see
124:21
those intense moments that's what makes
124:23
the game very exciting
124:25
seven having a lot of energy so somebody
124:28
has a lot of energy we say they're
124:30
energetic that's very easy right energy
124:33
is the noun energetic is the adjective
124:38
he has a lot of energy he is
124:42
energetic
124:43
okay so that would be the adjective for
124:46
energy
124:47
eight
124:49
to quit or to stop trying okay if
124:52
somebody stops trying like
124:54
they're boxing and somebody falls down
124:56
they can't get up they say i've had
124:57
enough what do they do they give up
125:00
sometimes when kids fight they shouldn't
125:03
fight really but sometimes you'll see
125:04
the kids will hold the other kid on the
125:06
ground say do you give up or usually
125:08
brothers when they're fighting right one
125:11
one brother say will you give up you
125:13
know stop fighting right let's stop
125:15
fighting do you but they want the other
125:17
person to give up
125:18
or sometimes in a video game you say oh
125:20
it's hopeless i don't want to play to
125:22
the end because i know i can't win so i
125:25
give up that means to quit or to stop
125:27
trying i give up or do you give up okay
125:32
number nine an entertaining and
125:35
difficult action what is an entertaining
125:38
entertaining and difficult action we can
125:41
say a trick
125:43
a trick is something that magicians this
125:46
is a magic trick right we usually think
125:48
of trick in terms of magic
125:51
some famous magicians
125:53
will do tricks that are difficult
125:56
to do but they're very entertaining it's
125:58
also difficult to figure out how did he
126:01
do that right and that is a trick
126:04
number ten
126:06
what the heck is that okay that's not a
126:08
real animal right it's an animal a
126:11
personality that is a symbol of a team
126:14
so somebody who's a symbol of a team you
126:16
have different symbols for different
126:18
teams in korea right
126:20
but we call those things mascot a
126:23
mascot so different teams will have
126:26
different
126:27
uh
126:28
animals or like a person in a funny
126:30
costume and they are the mascot so
126:32
usually it's an animal like bears or
126:34
eagles dolphins
126:36
something like that they will be the
126:38
mascot for the team
126:41
the next one number 11 is to walk over
126:45
violently of course this is acting right
126:48
here she's walking over this guy
126:49
violently she's trampling this guy but
126:53
usually when you think about this word
126:55
trample it's not just one person it's
126:58
like a crowd of people many people and
127:01
maybe they're scared or maybe they're
127:02
excited or they're very enthusiastic and
127:05
they don't
127:07
think about safety right they're just
127:09
running as a group and sometimes this
127:11
can be very dangerous especially in
127:14
crowded or narrow areas where many
127:16
people are moving and somebody falls
127:18
down
127:19
other people might not even know that
127:21
person is there because there's so many
127:22
people they will trample the person
127:24
who's on the ground so usually this is
127:27
not you know it's usually many people
127:29
walking over another person or it
127:32
doesn't even have to be a person you can
127:33
trample the ground if there's grass and
127:36
many people trample the grass then they
127:38
walk over the grass maybe they ruin the
127:40
grass so you trample in an area okay
127:44
12. a sweet drink with bubbles in it a
127:47
sweet drink with bubbles in it you're
127:49
thinking bubble tea well we think about
127:52
soda the bubbles are a little uh
127:55
gas little
127:57
bubbles of gas of course when you pour
127:59
coca-cola or cider
128:01
you say cider in korea in in america
128:04
we'd say sprite or we would say a 7-up
128:08
you have the carbonation the little
128:09
bubbles that rise
128:11
in the drink and that's a
128:13
sweet drink with bubbles in it not
128:14
bubble tea
128:16
you could say that but in this case
128:17
we're talking about soda
128:20
three
128:21
ink that is under the skin forever so
128:24
somebody will have uh you know an artist
128:27
will will draw or put this ink
128:30
under the skin of a person it's kind of
128:32
painful to do and once it's there it's
128:35
there forever you can't change it so
128:37
later on oh i don't like it sorry
128:40
what are you gonna do it's there and
128:42
it's very painful to get it to get it
128:44
off so be very careful if you do this
128:46
but they're calling it a tattoo
128:49
tattoo
128:50
tattoo isn't an english word by the way
128:52
it comes from the south pacific when the
128:54
english sailors
128:56
were in that area and they saw the
128:58
natives they had tattoos and that's what
129:00
they called it in on those islands they
129:02
said tattoo so the english sailors
129:04
brought that word back to england with
129:06
them and it became part of the english
129:08
language tattoo very interesting anyway
129:11
so that's a tattoo
129:13
14
129:14
being focused and trying hard to do
129:16
something being focused on something
129:19
very trying very hard to do it it means
129:21
you are dedicated you are dedicated you
129:25
are focused on your task so you are very
129:28
dedicated in doing your task now
129:31
dedicated is an adjective the noun of
129:33
course is dedication
129:37
so he has dedication he is
129:41
dedicated
129:42
he has dedication he is dedicated okay
129:47
next one 15. whoa this is very dangerous
129:50
right
129:52
bull fighting to move suddenly and
129:54
powerfully in one direction to move
129:56
suddenly and powerfully in one direction
130:00
what do bulls do
130:01
bulls charge right they suddenly start
130:04
running towards something and a bull is
130:07
very powerful it's charging
130:10
so it's not just bulls horses can charge
130:13
people can charge teams can charge a
130:17
crowd of people can charge just means
130:20
moving quickly and powerfully in one
130:22
direction
130:24
sixteen to cover with colored liquid of
130:27
course there's many forms or many ways
130:30
to do this what is this guy doing of
130:32
course he is painting a house but of
130:34
course we can also think about artists
130:37
like rembrandt or monet right
130:40
they are using paint to paint beautiful
130:42
pictures so to cover with colored liquid
130:45
whether it's very simple like painting a
130:47
house or painting a masterpiece like the
130:49
mona lisa right uh you're painting is
130:52
just to paint
130:54
okay well that's the words let's take a
130:57
look at the
130:58
exercises okay
131:00
the first one here we need to fill in
131:03
the blanks for all of these the first
131:04
one is our soccer beep isn't very good
131:07
we need practice so our soccer what
131:11
we talk about a group of people who play
131:13
soccer they're not very good we need to
131:16
practice so our soccer class our soccer
131:19
team our soccer fan or our soccer group
131:23
if you look at three of these if you
131:25
look at a
131:26
b and d
131:28
those are all about a group of people c
131:31
is about one person our soccer fan isn't
131:35
very good that sounds strange our soccer
131:37
fan is strange so let's get rid of c
131:40
we have a b and d
131:42
those are all talking about a group of
131:44
people
131:45
but what's the most common way to
131:47
describe a group of people who play
131:49
sports do we say a soccer class no a
131:52
class is for studying do we say a soccer
131:55
group
131:56
that's close but it's not that common to
131:58
say a soccer group it's much more common
132:01
to say soccer team and that's the answer
132:04
our soccer team isn't very good we need
132:07
practice so team is the best remember a
132:10
b and d are all a group of people but b
132:14
is the best answer because it's the most
132:16
common way to describe a group of people
132:18
who play a sport together
132:20
okay number
132:22
three we're skipping two
132:23
that storm was really what
132:26
that storm was really beep
132:28
it almost knocked that tree over so a
132:30
storm that is very strong it almost
132:33
knocks a tree is strong but a storm
132:35
comes along and tries almost knocks the
132:37
tree down what is it that storm was
132:39
really brief intense upset or heavy
132:43
which one sounds the best storm was
132:45
brief that means very quick so that's
132:47
not right
132:48
the storm was very intense
132:51
intense remember is
132:53
very focused
132:54
and very strong in some area and extreme
132:58
right so if a storm is extreme or
133:02
focused on some area it is intense and
133:04
it's very strong the storm was upset
133:07
that doesn't make sense because storms
133:09
don't have feelings
133:11
oh that storm looks angry oh that storm
133:13
looks happy well that's crazy okay and
133:16
heavy we don't say storms are heavy
133:18
that's it's a strange
133:20
relationship we don't say that we say
133:21
storms are intense or fierce or strong
133:25
or dangerous but intense is a very good
133:28
word to use to describe a storm
133:32
okay
133:33
number five i know i just ate supper but
133:37
i really want a what
133:39
so what do you usually eat after supper
133:42
after supper what do you normally eat
133:44
you want something sweet usually what
133:47
after i eat supper i want something
133:49
sweet after supper so
133:52
i know i just ate supper but what do i
133:55
want you want what a desert b snack c
133:59
fork d
134:00
breakfast be careful here with a
134:03
desert
134:05
okay there's two words that are very
134:07
similar desert and the other word is
134:11
dessert
134:13
now be very careful if this word had two
134:16
s's
134:17
it would be correct because that's
134:20
common after dinner i always want to
134:22
have a little bit of dessert like
134:24
something sweet piece of cake maybe a
134:26
cookie some candy you know just to have
134:29
after dinner and that's very common
134:32
to have dessert after dinner but desert
134:35
with 1s is like the sahara desert right
134:39
very dry no trees no water so of course
134:43
you don't eat the sahara desert after
134:45
dinner that's crazy right so desert be
134:48
careful desert or dessert right
134:51
this is desert not dessert so it doesn't
134:54
fit
134:55
okay
134:56
bee snack what is dessert dessert is
134:59
like a snack right so that is an that is
135:02
the answer right there a snack b
135:05
a fork i really want a fork
135:08
that doesn't make sense i want breakfast
135:10
after you ate supper no you have to
135:12
sleep first next morning then you have
135:14
breakfast the best answer here is snack
135:16
because i know i just ate supper i just
135:18
ate supper i know that
135:20
but i really want a snack i want
135:23
something more to eat
135:25
now usually after
135:27
supper after dinner by the way
135:30
americans say dinner
135:32
and supper are the same it's the meal
135:35
you have in the evening after that we
135:37
usually have dessert dessert is only
135:40
after supper we don't have dessert after
135:41
lunch you don't have dessert after
135:43
breakfast
135:44
after breakfast after lunch you have a
135:46
snack but you can also have a snack
135:48
after dinner after dinner you can have
135:50
dessert or you could also call it a
135:52
snack it doesn't matter okay anyway
135:54
that's kind of complicated
135:56
number seven
135:57
my dad always beat me in school what
136:00
does your dad always do
136:02
with you in school
136:04
does he clean you in school i hope not
136:07
the other kids
136:10
right strange dad okay don't do that
136:13
my dad always packs me in school puts
136:15
you in a suitcase no that's crazy
136:17
my dad always supports me in school he
136:21
supports me in school aha that's
136:23
interesting or my dad always brings me
136:26
in school
136:27
supports sounds correct what about
136:30
brings can we say my dad always brings
136:31
me in school no because you use brings
136:34
brings you
136:35
to school so the correct answer is
136:38
support my dad always supports me in
136:41
school you support someone in something
136:44
i support him in his efforts i support
136:48
him in his uh
136:52
field or in his job but you bring
136:55
somebody to a place so support is the
136:58
correct answer here okay well let's take
137:01
a break here we'll take a short break
137:02
and we'll go into the reading section

146:52
somebody and look up to that person what
146:54
are you doing you respect that person
146:57
okay respect can be a verb
147:01
it can also be a noun that's a v sorry
147:03
about that that's a v so verb and noun
147:06
you can have respect for someone
147:10
and you can respect someone so as a verb
147:14
i respect you
147:16
as a noun i have respect for you okay so
147:21
respect can be a verb or a noun next one
147:25
to try oh whoa this is kind of cool
147:28
look at that
147:29
right he's what is this cat doing and
147:31
this cat is like oh watch out this cat
147:33
is trying to harm of course they're just
147:35
playing right cats are very cute
147:38
right when they're playing so this cat
147:41
is attacking attack right of course you
147:43
probably know attack from playing video
147:45
games right a lot of video games you
147:47
attack the other team or the other
147:49
player
147:50
okay next one
147:53
to not pay attention to she looks upset
147:56
right she's not happy with him right and
147:59
he's sorry he's like saying i'm sorry
148:01
but she's not happy she doesn't want to
148:03
talk to him what is she doing she is
148:06
ignoring him to ignore somebody
148:11
sometimes when you're angry with your
148:12
friends you ignore them right because
148:14
you're angry but be patient right be
148:17
patient listen to them try to forgive
148:19
them okay what did they do
148:21
but by the way this is interesting she
148:24
turned
148:27
her
148:29
back
148:31
on so the expression is turn someone's
148:35
back on another person so she turned her
148:39
back on
148:40
him that's a good expression to use in
148:42
fact if you watch the lion king it's
148:44
kind of an old movie but it's a great
148:46
movie there's a good scene in there
148:48
where scar the evil lion
148:50
walks away from mufasa right and mufasa
148:53
says don't turn your back on me right
148:56
and that's a very interesting
148:58
expression right don't turn your back on
149:00
me don't ignore me so it's a good idiom
149:04
okay next one
149:06
whoa this guy looks really weird looks
149:08
strange he's mad another word for mad is
149:12
angry right we already talked about that
149:14
right when i was talking about patience
149:16
right it's very easy to get very angry
149:18
at something but another word for angry
149:21
is mad but be careful americans say mad
149:26
is the same as angry that's american
149:30
american english if you're british
149:33
usually british people will say mad is
149:35
the same as crazy right
149:39
right
149:40
crazy oh he's mad so a british person if
149:43
a british person says oh he's mad it
149:45
means he's crazy but if an american
149:47
person say says he's mad it means he's
149:51
angry okay so be careful there's
149:53
difference between american english and
149:55
british english and several several ways
149:57
and this is one of them
149:59
okay
150:00
a room with a toilet sink and usually a
150:03
shower or bath okay of course you go to
150:06
this place every morning right you you
150:08
you go poo there you pee there okay but
150:12
be careful using poo pee usually people
150:14
say you go to the bathroom in this room
150:16
you take a shower in this room you brush
150:19
your teeth in this room what is it of
150:21
course it's the bathroom and of course
150:24
because there's a bath there that's the
150:26
important thing it's the bathroom
150:29
okay
150:30
next one
150:31
being afraid
150:33
who likes to go to the dentist
150:36
i don't like to go to the dentist oh so
150:38
we might be scared of the dentist we're
150:42
scared of the dentist we're afraid of
150:44
the dentist right
150:46
hopefully your dentist is good and
150:48
doesn't make you scared but
150:51
don't worry you need to go to the
150:53
dentist
150:54
many times in your life
150:56
next one
150:58
okay let's talk about the review okay
151:01
let's see how well we remember these
151:03
words
151:04
our instructions are choose the word
151:06
that best completes the sentence here
151:08
are our words down here and here are
151:10
blanks and you'll notice we're skipping
151:12
all the even numbers so we're just going
151:14
to do one three five seven okay so we'll
151:17
just do four okay so number one john is
151:20
a beep friend he would never lie to me
151:24
so think about that word again
151:27
somebody who is honest
151:29
and trustworthy you can depend on them
151:32
what word did we learn that means that
151:35
okay loyal bad basic or new well if you
151:39
remember we said loyal loyal friend is a
151:43
person who never lies to you it's
151:45
somebody who
151:46
you can trust and who is always honest
151:49
to you lie is the opposite of honest
151:52
right so if somebody is loyal to you
151:54
they are always honest with you they're
151:56
loyal they won't lie to you they won't
152:00
do something to hurt you okay they are
152:02
loyal
152:03
okay number three the teacher will beep
152:06
us with a pizza party but only if we do
152:09
well on the test so
152:11
we've got a couple things here right we
152:13
have one thing is pizza party a pizza
152:16
party that's a great thing right yay
152:19
we're very happy to get a pizza party
152:21
that's something very good but we only
152:24
get it if
152:26
if
152:28
what we do well on the test
152:30
if we
152:31
do a good job on the test the teacher
152:34
will do something right what word did we
152:37
learn that means something like that the
152:40
teacher will give us a gift if we do a
152:42
good job what word means that a train
152:47
b reward
152:49
c
152:50
inform and d let and of course they're
152:53
all verbs because only a verb will fit
152:55
in here after will so train reward
152:59
inform or let of course you remember the
153:01
word is reward the teacher will reward
153:04
us because if we do a good job we do
153:07
well on the test the teacher will reward
153:10
us what is the reward a pizza party yay
153:13
not trained not informed not let those
153:16
don't fit the best word is reward okay
153:18
next one number five
153:21
fighting and lying are bad what okay now
153:25
think about it uh the rules at school
153:28
think about the rules at school or the
153:30
rules at your home are you allowed to
153:32
fight and to lie at home no that's
153:36
against the rules at home in school are
153:38
you allowed to fight your classmates or
153:41
lie to your teacher no that's against
153:44
the rules of the school so behavior that
153:47
is against the rules of something okay i
153:49
just said the answer there right is like
153:51
fighting and lying is it a patience b
153:54
problem c behavior or d tricks right i
153:58
just said behavior right fighting and
154:00
lying are bad behavior it's against the
154:04
rules of a certain place that's what we
154:06
talked about before
154:07
it's not bad patience that doesn't make
154:10
sense bad problem fighting and lying are
154:12
bad problems
154:14
right you could do that but remember you
154:17
have to have s at the end of that
154:19
fighting and lying are bad tricks that's
154:22
isang hail it's best to say fighting and
154:25
lying or bad behavior that's the best
154:27
answer there
154:28
okay number seven
154:30
the new team beep is very strong
154:33
okay so the new team what remember on a
154:37
team there are many people right and who
154:40
are those people a lot of those people
154:42
are followers but there's one person in
154:44
that group who's going to do what
154:47
a homework b trick c treat or d leader
154:51
okay so think about that which word
154:53
makes sense here the new team homework
154:55
doesn't make sense the new team trick
154:59
that doesn't fit the new team treat
155:02
that doesn't make any sense at all the
155:04
new team leader ah that's the only one
155:06
that makes sense
155:08
right so that must be the answer the new
155:10
team leader
155:12
is very strong right so the leader of
155:15
the team is a strong person so that team
155:18
is probably also pretty strong you got
155:21
to be careful
155:22
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
155:24
section of the lesson
155:26

you are being educated by your teachers
160:51
and your textbooks
160:52
when you go to the library and you read

160:58
important to continue to be educated
161:01
throughout our lives even after you

it's more than what is useful you don't
161:34
need it for uh for using it it's not
161:37
it's not something that you that you
161:39
need to use it's just something extra
161:42
right something above and
161:45
beyond what you need or what is useful
161:48
it's extra usually it's a bonus we think
161:50
of it in in the terms of positive
161:53
thinking right so dessert after dinner

is something extra for you to eat you
161:59
don't need it maybe it's not useful but
162:01
you like it right that's extra okay

extra in your lunch when you go to
162:08
school or you'll get something extra
162:11
from your friends if they give you
162:12
something you don't need it maybe it's
162:14
not useful but it's something that you
162:16
like it's extra
162:19
seven
162:20
a place to keep animals for people to
162:22
see so these people are visiting what
162:24
they're visiting the zoo the giraffe
162:27
lives in the zoo well this giraffe lives
162:29
in the zoo most giraffes live in the
162:31
wild right but in some many cities there
162:34
are zoos where people can go and they
162:36
can see animals these animals are not
162:39
tame they're not pets
162:41
they're they're kind of wild animals
162:44
even though they don't live in nature
162:46
they live in a a
162:48
place that's built by human beings
162:50
they are in a zoo but they are not tame
162:54
you have to be careful when approaching
162:56
these animals because they're maybe not
162:58
used to being around human beings
163:01
okay we say that of course that's a zoo
163:03
i forget the the word zoo when you say

163:35
to be very smart and very intelligent to
163:37
be able to do this we say
163:40
this person is special some kids some
163:43
young people are very smart they're like
163:46
geniuses and they are able to do these
163:48
types of things at an early age maybe
163:51
even better than people who are a lot
163:53
older than them some of them are a lot
163:55
smarter than their teachers in school
163:57
they are special kids and they should
163:59
have special education okay next one
164:03

164:07
scene
164:08
having a lot of water in the air now
164:11
having a lot of water in the air it's
164:12
kind of hard to show a picture of that
164:14
but basically if you're at the beach you
164:16
notice you're next to the ocean it's
164:18
very hot uh when it's hot a lot of the
164:21
water
164:22
comes into the air right and in korean
164:24
you say
164:27
right
164:27
in english we say it's human during the
164:30
summer time in korea it's very humid
164:33
isn't it
164:34
and you sweat a lot uh in this in the
164:37
winter time it's dry so the opposite of
164:40
humid the opposite pandero is dry it's
164:44
dry in the winter but humid in the
164:47
summer humid means it has a lot of water
164:50
in the air
164:51
next one
164:52
people who make sure we follow the laws
164:55
who are people that make sure we follow
164:57
the laws we call these people police
165:00
this person is a police man but there
165:03
are also police women
165:06
okay if you just want to make you talk
165:08
about police you can just say police you
165:10
know it doesn't mean man or woman it's
165:12
just the police and usually we say the
165:14
police force it's a group of people men
165:17
and women who
165:19
make sure we follow the laws they
165:22

165:25
law by speeding going too fast or if he
165:28
doesn't stop at the stoplight or stop
165:31
sign
165:32

165:35
sure that he follows the law next time
165:39
11. oh we have a plan they're playing
165:41
doctor right he's going to be the doctor
165:44

165:46
a thing does or is used for but what a
165:49
thing does or is used for we call that a
165:52
role right
165:55
so what is the role of the things that
165:58
you use for example the mask what's the
166:00
role of the mask the role of the mask or
166:03
the function of the mask is to prevent
166:06
disease from transferring from one
166:08
person to another so what the thing does
166:10
or what it is used for we can say what's
166:13
its role you could also say what is it
166:16
what is its function
166:20
what is its function or what is it used
166:23

166:37
try to beat somebody you fight them of
166:39

166:42
is
166:43
very common
166:45
among brothers and sisters and friends
166:47
right hey you're fighting somebody but
166:49
you don't mean to hurt them you're just
166:51
having fun you're trying to beat the
166:53
other person and you're fighting them
166:56
of course we also fight people in video
166:58
games try don't fight people physically
167:01
that's not good behavior but you're
167:03
trying to beat the other person now
167:04
fight isn't irregular verb it has
167:07
different forms when we use it in past
167:09
tense so we say fight
167:12
fought
167:13
fought
167:14
fight fought fought okay that's the uh
167:17
different verb forms depending on the
167:20
verb tense that you're using present or
167:22
past tense with a simple past or past
167:24
perfect
167:25
okay next one 13 oh
167:28
this house looks terrible right it's
167:31
leaning to one side situation or
167:34
environment the condition
167:37
of this house is very bad in fact this
167:41
house should be torn down it's not safe
167:44
the condition is
167:46
unsafe what is the condition of this
167:49
house dangerous unsafe it should be torn
167:52
down and a new house should be built a
167:55
new house the condition is very good and
167:57
the condition is safe
167:59
okay so the situation environment is
168:02
like the condition
168:04
okay next one made of hardened sand and
168:07
stone made of hardened sand and stone
168:10
what is this this is concrete okay so
168:13
you see this truck sometimes you see
168:16
these trucks at
168:17
kong su jung kong jung sites right
168:21
and that's construction site and they
168:23
use concrete to build buildings or other
168:26
types of things roads
168:28
walls
168:30
concrete is used for a lot of different
168:32
things and they use sand and stone
168:34
crushed up stone water also
168:37
and they can make concrete okay made of
168:40
hardened sand and stone concrete this
168:43
isn't hard this is wet but after it
168:45
dries it becomes hard and it's a very
168:47
strong building material
168:50
okay number 15
168:52
a huge field with grass and few trees so
168:56
a huge field
168:58
lots of grass a few trees here and there
169:01
we call this place a plane a plane
169:06
and if you talk about the planes usually
169:07
people say the planes like if they say
169:10
the great plains the great plains is a
169:13
is an area designated in the middle of
169:15
america it involves states like texas
169:18
oklahoma nebraska
169:22
and higher up the dakotas
169:24
these states
169:26
they're not a lot of trees it's just
169:27
very flat and lots of grass and there's
169:30
a lot of farmland there now a long time
169:32
ago it's just grass and buffalo would
169:35
run up and down this area and the
169:37
indians would hunt the buffalo those are
169:39
the great plains
169:40
okay so plain a very flat area huge
169:44
field you can see from miles and miles
169:45
and miles it takes days to go across the
169:48
great plains
169:50
okay last word a deep hole if you have a
169:53
deep hole like this this looks like a
169:54
mining operation but a deep hole we call
169:57
it a pit i used to work for a mining
169:59
company in america i was in the human
170:02
resources department at a large mining
170:04
company and that's what we call we call
170:06
it the pit we say the north pit the
170:08
south pit right so a pit is a deep hole
170:11
but pit doesn't just mean mining it can
170:13
be a natural
170:15
pit for example sometimes you hear on
170:16
the news where the ground just opens up
170:19
and they call that a sinkhole but it's
170:21
also you can also say it's a pit it's
170:23
just a deep hole in the ground it's a
170:25
pit
170:26
okay that's our words let's go over the
170:29
words how well do we remember these
170:31
words let's do some exercises
170:34
number one i enjoy movies they are great
170:37
beep
170:38
and then we have the words here so we
170:40
have a waste be audience c entertainment
170:44
d
170:45
people
170:46
what do we say about this word we said
170:48
that
170:49
something that you do
170:51
for fun
170:52
right
170:53
like a movie it could be playing a video
170:56
game it could be playing soccer there's
170:58
many forms of it what is it of course we
171:00
talked about entertainment i enjoy
171:03
movies they are great entertainment not
171:06
waste that doesn't make sense not
171:08
audience that doesn't make sense and not
171:10
people
171:11
movies are not people that's weird
171:14
movies are a form of entertainment there
171:16
are many types of entertainment there
171:18
are many forms of entertainment movies
171:21
are one type of entertainment
171:24
okay skipping number two going to three
171:27
you can see monkeys in cages at the what
171:31
where can you go and see animals in
171:34
cages hopefully not in cages that's not
171:36
very nice it's not very good hopefully
171:38
they're in open areas but sometimes
171:40
they're in large cages okay where do you
171:42
see them and the planes in the jungle at
171:46
the zoo or in the at the environment
171:49
right notice we say at
171:52
that's important too because we don't
171:54
say at the planes we say on the planes
171:57
we don't say at the jungle we say in the
172:00
jungle let me write this down for you
172:02
on
172:03
the planes
172:05
in the oops in the jungle
172:08
at the zoo
172:10
and in
172:12
the environment so really we see at here
172:15
at is here so that kind of gives us the
172:17
idea anyway right you can see monkeys in
172:19
cages at the zoo we say at the zoo we
172:23
don't you can say in the zoo but
172:25
it's more common to say at the zoo but
172:27
we don't say at the planes we say on the
172:30
planes we don't say at the jungle we say
172:33
in the jungle and environment is usually
172:36
common to say in the environment in an
172:39
environment so
172:41
just looking at the preposition zoo is
172:43
the only one that we have to choose so
172:45
zoo is the answer but zoo is also the
172:47
only one that makes sense you don't see
172:49
monkeys in cages on the plains or in the
172:52
jungle the jungle is a natural
172:54
environment you don't have cages in the
172:57
jungle where monkeys live that's crazy
173:00
and in the enviro in the environment
173:02
that doesn't fit well with the sentence
173:04
anyway the best answer is zoo even if we
173:06
don't worry about the preposition
173:09
okay next one number five
173:11
i was beep at a good school
173:13
what
173:14
are what is done to you at a school not
173:17
nothing bad that sounds about what it's
173:18
done to you at a school but in a
173:20
positive sense
173:22
what happens to you at school right are
173:25
you educated are you entertained are you
173:28
kept are you treated well you could be
173:31
all four of those things but one of
173:33
those is the best choice i was educated
173:37
at a good school
173:39
hopefully you are if it's a good school
173:42
you will get a good education so you
173:44
will be educated at a good school i was
173:48
educated at a good school you could say
173:51
i was entertained at a good school but
173:54
the purpose for going to school is not
173:56
to be entertained the purpose for going
173:59
to school is to be educated so that's
174:02
not a very good fit
174:03
i was kept at a good school this sounds
174:06
like you were kept a prisoner at a good
174:08
school that sounds a little strange it's
174:10
possible grammatically but it sounds
174:12
strange i was treated at a good school
174:15
and that sounds odd too because that
174:17
doesn't say anything you were treated at
174:19
a good school
174:20
usually we have to say i was treated
174:21
well or was treated poorly
174:24
right how were you treated if you just
174:26
say i was treated at a good school that
174:27
doesn't say anything
174:29
what does it say and so it doesn't fit
174:31
the best answer is educated i was
174:33
educated at a good school it means i got
174:36
a good education
174:38
seven my dog is beep he has two
174:41
different colored eyes well that's
174:43
strange if your dog has one blue eye and
174:47
one brown eye that's kind of strange
174:49
right so would you say your dog is poor
174:51
your dog is special your dog is small or
174:54
your dog is old okay well strange can be
174:59
unusual right it can be uh
175:03
different it can be
175:05
special not ordinary right so the only
175:07
one is that fits is special pore doesn't
175:10
fit my dog is poor doesn't have any
175:12
money dogs don't care about that
175:14
my dog is small okay your dog is small
175:17
but why would you say he has two
175:19
different colored eyes that's not an
175:20
example of being small
175:23
my dog is old okay well he's old but why
175:26
would you say his two different colored
175:27
eyes having two different colored eyes
175:30
is not an example of being old
175:32
but
175:33
having two different colored eyes is an
175:35
example of being special so make sure
175:37
that this adjective fits the explanation
175:41
or the example right if this example
175:44
does not fit
175:46
the adjective
175:47
it's not a good match it's not a good
175:50
connection so special is the best choice
175:52
here because you're saying the first
175:54
sentence and then you're giving an
175:55
example of that okay so always make sure
175:58
you have that connection when you're
175:59
filling in exercises like this
176:02
okay that wraps up the vocabulary
176:04
section now let's take a short break and
176:06
go into the reading part let's take a
176:09
break
176:28
[Music]
176:38
hello everybody welcome back to reading
176:40
for vocabulary i'm your host brian
176:42
stewart we're going over the same topic
176:45
we're talking about caring for animals
176:47
but in this lesson lesson 9 we're going
176:50
to focus on who helps sick or injured
176:55
pets the title of course is a healthy
176:58
pet is a happy pet so if your pet is not
177:02
healthy
177:03
what happens who helps that pet who
177:06
helps a sick or injured pet well that's
177:08
what we're going to read about in
177:10
today's lesson but as usual let's learn
177:13
some vocabulary first now our first word
177:16
is uh oh
177:17
here we have a problem right
177:20
hurt having a cut or other injury this
177:22
poor baseball player looks to be injured
177:26
right maybe they got hit by the ball or
177:28
they twisted their leg or something
177:30
happened or another player ran into that
177:32
person
177:33
so what do we call a person who becomes
177:38
injured
177:40
while
177:41
playing or working or doing whatever
177:43
right
177:44
you could be walking to school and you
177:45
can become injured right so if you hurt
177:48
yourself or you get hurt somebody else
177:50
hurts you and you have a cut or you have
177:54
a bruise there are many types of
177:56
injuries right
177:59
many types of injuries but you are
178:01
injured part of your body is damaged
178:04
that means injured now be careful
178:06
because injured doesn't mean the same as
178:08
sick
178:09
if you're sick that means you have a
178:11
virus or some kind of disease right
178:14
that's affecting your body and you don't
178:17
feel right if you're injured there's
178:19
been some kind of physical damage to
178:21
your body okay so
178:24
injury and sickness are different
178:26
remember that okay and that's how in the
178:28
title we had to say who helps sick or
178:32
injured animals because they're
178:34
different a sick animal is not the same
178:37
as an injured animal it's a different
178:39
type of problem when you're sick it's a
178:41
different problem than if you're injured
178:44
okay so those are two different
178:46
conditions
178:47
okay next one
178:49
a medicine that help that keeps you from
178:51
getting sick now
178:54
right it's terrible and probably you
178:56
were in this situation before but it's
178:58
very important that you go to the doctor
179:00
and the doctor gives you medicine
179:01
usually a shot right that helps you
179:05
from becoming sick later everybody has
179:08
it right now we call these things a
179:11
vaccine
179:12
it's a it's a medicine
179:14
that you get when you're young to
179:16
prevent you from getting sick later some
179:19
people still have the bump on their arm
179:21
from where they got a shot when they
179:23
were young usually it's for smallpox or
179:26
some other disease like that like polio
179:30
and this is a vaccine of course we live
179:32
in a very
179:34
convenient age the modern age that we
179:37
live in
179:38
is very convenient we don't think about
179:40
it but medicine has developed so we can
179:43
take these vaccines when we're young we
179:45
don't have to worry about these diseases
179:47
a hundred years ago
179:49
200 years ago people died
179:52
by the thousands by the millions from
179:55
diseases that we don't worry about today
179:58
because of vaccines so yes it hurts but
180:02
it's important to get a vaccine people
180:04
will say shot have you gotten your shots
180:07
yet or i need to get a shot so to get a
180:10
shot
180:11
get
180:13
a
180:14
shot
180:16
because it's like a shot that you get in
180:18
your arm and that's usually a vaccine
180:20
for something that will prevent you from
180:23
getting sick nowadays we hear a lot
180:25
about the flu shot the flu shot it's a
180:27
vaccine to prevent you from getting the
180:29
flu and people will take it every year
180:32
before winter starts to protect them
180:35
from the flu
180:36
okay next one three sharing equally with
180:40
others so these two artists or producers
180:43
or i'm not sure what's going on here
180:45
they're sharing their award equally what
180:48
they have that award what do they have
180:51
they have it in
180:52
common if you have something in common
180:54
with somebody that means you share that
180:56
condition or that attribute right if you
181:00
and your mother are very similar
181:03
in appearance right your appearance you
181:06
share your appearance in common if you
181:08
and your father have the same sense of
181:10
humor right you share that same sense of
181:13
humor then you have a sense of humor in
181:16
common
181:17
it means you have something similar to
181:19
somebody else
181:21
okay next one number four whoa that's
181:23
kind of a funny looking picture right
181:25
here's a little boy and he's meeting his
181:28
younger brother or sister but not yet
181:31
his younger brother sister is still in
181:33
his mommy's belly right
181:35
having a baby growing inside one so mom
181:38
here what can we say about mom she has a
181:40
baby inside of her
181:42
womb inside of her belly right
181:45
it's she is pregnant so she is pregnant
181:49
sometimes people say she's with child
181:52
but she is pregnant okay
181:55
next one difficult something that is
181:58
very difficult to do like climb
182:00
uh the rocks without a shirt on that's
182:03
that's tough okay i'm just kidding about
182:05
without the shirt on it's it's tough
182:07
even with a shirt on but
182:09
it's difficult it's tough right so
182:12
they're synonyms basically if you say
182:14
something is very difficult you can say
182:15
oh it's very tough right for example if
182:18
you have a difficult test you can say
182:21
whoa that test was very tough it was a
182:24
tough test it was a difficult test
182:28
right it was tough or it was difficult
182:31
next one
182:32
when a doctor cuts you open
182:36
and fixes you that's what's going on
182:38
here and this is
182:40
this is something that's extreme right
182:43
thankfully it's not very common but
182:45
sometimes some people maybe us maybe you
182:49
maybe me might have a situation where
182:52
the doctor needs to cut actually cut
182:54
open our body and fix something inside
182:58
to help cure us
183:00
what do we call that procedure we say it
183:03
is surgery okay now the verb that we
183:06
usually use with surgery is perform
183:11
the doctor will perform surgery
183:14
uh or i need to another way that we
183:18
call this is operation
183:20
an operation
183:24
i need to have
183:27
an operation so if i say if i'm in the
183:30
hospital and i say i have to have an
183:33
operation that means the doctor will
183:35
perform surgery on me right the doctor
183:39
performs surgery on me
183:43
i need to have an operation those are
183:46
the common ways that we talk about this
183:48
situation
183:50
also surgery can be used as an adjective
183:53
for example the surgery room uh
183:56
this is the surgery preparation room or
184:00
this is the surgery area of the hospital
184:03
so sometimes surgery can also be an
184:05
adjective not just a noun okay but
184:08
remember when it is a noun we usually
184:10
use say perform surgery and we also say
184:14
i need to have an operation or you need
184:16
an operation that's the same idea okay
184:19
so a couple of common expressions for
184:21
that situation next one
184:25
a visit to the doctor to check your
184:27
health now you should do this every year
184:30
some people go every six months right
184:32
maybe when they're younger it's
184:33
important to do that but you need to
184:36
regularly go to the doctor to check your
184:39
health and that's part of the word right
184:42
check up because the doctor needs to
184:45
check on you
184:47
you need to check to make sure you're
184:48
not sick
184:50
it's called a checkup and usually people
184:52
go once a year for their annual checkup
184:56
okay number eight
184:59
a person who treats people for
185:00
sicknesses and injuries
185:03
when you go to the doctor to check for
185:05
sicknesses or if you have an injury
185:08
who do you go to what do you call that
185:09
person i think i just said it doctor
185:11
right this person this lady she is a
185:14
doctor right and there are many
185:15
different types of doctors right some
185:18
doctors will only specialize in like the
185:21
nose the throat and the ears
185:24
some doctors will only specialize in
185:26
treating children some doctors will only
185:29
specialize in fixing broken bones right
185:32
there are many different types of
185:34
doctors
185:35
okay number nine
185:37
happening at the same time every time so
185:40
this is like uh
185:42
something that happens every time if you
185:44
wind this up this is what musicians
185:46
usually use right it goes tick tick tick
185:49
tick
185:50
every time at a certain time what do we
185:52
say it's regular it's regular clocks are
185:56
regular they
185:58
show us the time
186:00
all the time every time right and one
186:02
hour they go around the clock
186:04
regularly or clocks are very regular we
186:07
can depend on them
186:08
sometimes we have habits that are
186:10
regular for example every morning you
186:12
get up you take a shower you brush your
186:14
teeth or you eat breakfast then you
186:16
brush your teeth that's your regular
186:18
morning routine that's regular if you do
186:20
something different that's unusual right
186:23
that would be the opposite but happening
186:25
at the same time every time that's
186:28
regular
186:29
okay next one
186:32
mo right we have a couple of cows here a
186:35
baby cow right animals will have
186:37
different names
186:39
for
186:40
different sexes right male or female
186:43
they'll also have different names for
186:45
their age right we we don't really say
186:48
we can't say baby cow but you could also
186:51
say calf calf is more specific right a
186:55
baby horse you could say it's a baby
186:57
horse or you could say it's a cult
187:01
right you could say a baby dog or you
187:04
can say
187:05
puppy right isn't it interesting in
187:08
english
187:09
i don't know if it's the same in korean
187:11
but in english we have all these special
187:13
words for baby animals and they're
187:16
they're usually a lot different right
187:18
there's also cub right for
187:20
bears and lions and tigers have cubs
187:24
dogs have puppies
187:26
horses have colts cows have calves oh so
187:31
many words to remember okay but it's
187:33
very interesting okay next one
187:36
oh what's wrong with him he had a bad
187:39
haircut right he should sue his barber
187:42
no i'm just kidding he wanted it that
187:44
way obviously you have to you have to
187:47
specifically ask for this type of
187:49
haircut okay strange and unusual i'm
187:52
making a comment about it because it's
187:54
not normal to see somebody with a
187:56
haircut like this it is yeah you could
187:59
say weird okay he's strange he's unusual
188:02
you could also say
188:04
unique
188:06
now it's interesting because if we say
188:08
weird weird has a little bit of a
188:10
negative
188:12
feeling to it you say it's weird it's
188:14
like oh that's weird but if you say it's
188:17
unique that can have a little bit of a
188:19
positive feeling about it so it depends
188:22
on how you look at the situation if you
188:25
look at him and says wow that's cool
188:27
he's unique or you can look at him and
188:30
say oh that's not good it's weird okay
188:34
so be careful using weird because weird
188:37
usually means you have a negative
188:38
feeling about something or unique
188:41
can be if you have a positive feeling
188:43
about something but it's strange it's
188:45
unusual then say oh that's unique okay
188:48
so that's more polite or better feeling
188:51
associated with unique than weird okay
188:54
so that's interesting about these words
188:56
here
188:57
next a container for carrying something
189:00
this is a container for carrying
189:02
something if you have to carry your pet
189:04
for example you will carry your pet in a
189:06
carrier usually we only use this word
189:09
though it's usually used for
189:12
transporting animals a carrier if you
189:15
have a container for carrying your books
189:19
you don't call it a carrier you call it
189:20
a backpack if you have a container for
189:23
carrying your food to a school or to
189:26
your office we don't really call it a
189:28
carrier you could but it's a little
189:29
strange we just say it's a food
189:31
container or if you use the brand name
189:34
it's tupperware right
189:36
so we
189:37
carrier is usually specifically used for
189:39
a container that carries animals for
189:42
transportation next one number 13 a
189:45
place where animals are raised for food
189:48
now a lot of people they don't know
189:49
where their food comes from they think
189:51
oh food comes from the supermarket but
189:53
that's not true where does the
189:55
supermarket get the food the supermarket
189:57
is not the original place where the food
190:00
comes from the food comes from animals a
190:03
lot of animals and also plants uh where
190:06
the animals are raised for food like for
190:08
example pork or uh beef sogogi right if
190:12
you want to have uh uh
190:15
uh sorry i bulgogi i had a
190:18
hard time just remembering that bulgogi
190:21
or duiji calabi right
190:23
that meat comes from where it comes from
190:26
a farm
190:28
okay we say it's a farm where animals
190:30
are raised for food okay sometimes
190:33
people will also call it a ranch but a
190:36
ranch has a little bit of a different
190:39
idea a ranch is much bigger than a farm
190:42
and a ranch is usually where you have a
190:44
lot of
190:45
cows or cattle that's usually where
190:48
cattle is
190:49
is uh is raised and it's usually very
190:52
big farms tend to be small and farms are
190:55
also places where they grow
190:57
plants like corn
190:59
wheat things like that but our ranches
191:02
where usually specifically for cows we
191:04
have very big
191:06
groups herds of of cattle okay so anyway
191:10
farm and ranch we usually we talk about
191:12
farm a place where animals are raised
191:14
for food okay next one
191:17
now she looks like she's doing yoga
191:19
right and she's stretching her body so
191:21
that her hands are pointing where
191:24
they're facing away from the front front
191:26
her fingers are pointing away from her
191:28
front they are pointing backward okay
191:32
now if you turn around right right now
191:34
i'm looking at you i'm looking at you in
191:37
the front but i can turn this way now
191:39
i'm looking backward okay it just means
191:41
facing away from the front
191:43
looking backward or stretching backward
191:47
okay
191:48
next one a doctor who cares for animals
191:52
now there's a very long word
191:54
veterinarian we'll see that word later
191:56
in the reading veterinarian but that's a
191:59
hindu word to pronounce so a lot of
192:01
people just say that so veterinarian
192:06
just say vet because it's a lot easier
192:08
and most people just say vet a vet is a
192:11
doctor who cares for animals but be
192:13
careful
192:15
because vet sometimes also can mean
192:18
something else that is completely
192:20
different a veteran
192:23
a veteran is a soldier who served in a
192:27
war or served for their country in the
192:30
military sometimes people will call
192:32
those people a vet too he's a vet he's
192:35
served in the iraq war they're not
192:37
talking about a person who cares for
192:39
animals okay so be careful that can mean
192:43
a former ex-soldier right a person who
192:46
used to be a soldier or it can be a
192:48
doctor who cares for animals so be
192:51
careful don't be confused if somebody
192:53
says vet you have to know the situation
192:55
what is the context of the situation
192:58
okay
193:00
last word
193:04
okay
193:05
a hard cover that goes over a part of
193:07
your body now unfortunately this girl
193:10
she doesn't seem to be upset about it
193:12
but she's been injured right she
193:14
probably broke or sprained her ankle or
193:18
her foot so she has to put something on
193:22
that part of her body to keep the bones
193:24
from moving you want to keep the bones
193:26
in the same position so they can heal
193:29
together
193:30
now when i first came to korea it was
193:32
konglish people called it gibs right
193:36
gipps but that's konglish the word is
193:39
cast
193:40
now i was very confused i was like why
193:43
do my students call this a gips
193:46
where does that come from well i learned
193:48
that this is made of the same material
193:51
that chalk white chalk in your classroom
193:54
is made of and that's gypsum
193:56
ah very interesting so
193:59
gibbs comes from the material that the
194:02
cast is made from right and so i don't
194:05
know where that started whether it comes
194:07
from japan or you know a lot of congress
194:09
comes from japan i don't know where that
194:11
came from but some somewhere people were
194:14
thinking okay well the cast is made of
194:16
gypsum so they just thought gipps and
194:19
they called it that well that's konglish
194:21
americans
194:22
don't have any idea about that it
194:23
confused me when i first heard it i'm
194:26
like where does that come from
194:27
we normally just say cast right and you
194:31
put a cast on it or you wear a cast just
194:34
like a shoe or a shirt you wear
194:39
a cast wear a cast okay or you could say
194:42
the doctor put a cast on my foot now
194:45
even though you wear it it's not like a
194:47
shoe you can't take it off and put it
194:49
back on right the doctor puts it on and
194:52
then six weeks later the doctor has to
194:55
cut it off right
194:57
so it's not normal piece of clothing but
194:59
we use the same verb wear a cast i have
195:02
to wear a cast for six months and don't
195:06
say this that's konglish okay let's
195:09
review how well do we remember these
195:12
words
195:13
let's go over the
195:14
comprehension questions here
195:17
just the same as usual we have a blank
195:19
we need to choose the best word to fill
195:22
in the blank number one smallpox i
195:25
talked about that before smallpox was a
195:28
disease a hundred years ago 200 years
195:31
ago terrible disease killed many many
195:33
people it was a sickness that is gone
195:36
now thanks to people getting what
195:38
remember i told you when you're young
195:40
it's important to get that medicine to
195:42
get a shot what's in the shot is it a
195:44
checkup is it a vaccine is it an injury
195:47
or is it a doctor well of course it's
195:49
not a doctor you can't put a person
195:51
inside that shot that's crazy it's not
195:53
an injury that doesn't make sense it's
195:55
not a checkup it's of course a vaccine
195:58
right
196:00
thanks to people getting the vaccine
196:02
smallpox is gone nobody ever gets
196:05
smallpox anymore because medicine has
196:08
advanced so much that we just get the
196:11
vaccine and the disease has died out in
196:13
human beings it's not there anymore okay
196:16
number two the pilot was beep badly when
196:19
his plane crashed think about that
196:21
somebody's flying a plane and they don't
196:23
land correctly the plane crashes well
196:25
what's going to happen
196:27
the pilot was what celebrated injured
196:29
pregnant or treated
196:31
you can't get pregnant from crashing
196:33
your plane that's crazy
196:35
okay
196:37
you're probably not going to be
196:38
celebrated with celebrated badly that
196:40
doesn't make any sense celebrated is a
196:42
good thing uh treated he was treated
196:45
badly when his plane crashed that's
196:47
possible actually right people said oh
196:49
you shouldn't have crashed a plane but
196:51
more logically he was injured badly
196:55
that makes more sense because of course
196:57
when you think about it if you crash a
196:59
plane or even if you crash a car or even
197:02
your bicycle you crash you could get
197:05
badly injured so be careful when you're
197:07
in a vehicle or riding your bike
197:10
you can become injured
197:12
badly when
197:14
your vehicle crashes whether it's a
197:16
plane it's a car or a bike be careful
197:18
and follow the safety
197:20
rules and regulations
197:22
okay number five skipping up to number
197:24
five i get along well with my girlfriend
197:27
do you have a girlfriend or boyfriend
197:29
okay do you get along well with that
197:32
person
197:33
we have a lot
197:35
what if you get along with your
197:37
girlfriend it doesn't have to be
197:38
girlfriend it could just be friend you
197:40
get along well with your friend
197:43
because we have a lot of what of
197:44
problems
197:46
we have a lot of boredom we have a lot
197:48
to forget
197:50
or we have a lot in common what makes
197:53
sense
197:54
if you have a lot of problems with your
197:56
girlfriend
197:57
you don't get along well maybe it's time
197:59
to break up and go find somebody else
198:01
who you don't have problems with
198:04
we have a lot of boredom
198:06
that doesn't make sense right that does
198:08
you get along with somebody because
198:09
you're both bored together that's ysung
198:11
hail
198:12
we have a lot to forget
198:14
strange too we have a lot in common ah
198:17
remember in common means you share
198:20
something with somebody else so if you
198:22
share something with somebody else you
198:23
can understand them better so if you
198:26
have a lot and we say a lot in common
198:29
that's a common expression we have a lot
198:32
in common
198:33
then
198:34
you get along with the other person if
198:36
you don't get along with somebody you
198:38
can say we have nothing
198:40
in common that's the pandiro that's the
198:43
opposite right so if you meet somebody
198:45
you think they could be my friend but
198:47
they're very different from you they
198:49
don't like the same things that you do
198:51
they don't like the same movies or the
198:53
same
198:54
music they don't like the same books
198:56
they don't like the same hobbies that
198:58
you do you're not going to be able to
199:00
spend a lot of time with them because
199:02
you don't like the things they do you
199:03
don't have anything in common you have
199:06
nothing in common but on the other
199:09
situation if you have many things in
199:11
common you have a lot in common you like
199:14
the same books you like the same hobbies
199:16
you like the same movies then you can
199:18
get along with that person well okay
199:21
number seven
199:23
i can't believe you're beep and you're
199:25
going to have twins have twins that
199:28
means that somebody is going to have
199:30
babies now remember what we talked about
199:32
what's that word if somebody has a baby
199:35
in their belly
199:36
what are they are they necessary are
199:38
they small are they slow or are they
199:40
pregnant well of course the only one
199:42
that makes sense is pregnant i can't
199:44
believe you're pregnant and you're gonna
199:46
have twins not just one baby but two
199:49
babies right at the same time you're
199:51
gonna have twins necessary doesn't make
199:53
sense i can't believe you're small
199:56
what does that mean how does that have
199:58
to do with twins and i can't believe
200:01
you're slow it's kind of funny too the
200:03
only one that makes sense is pregnant
200:05
okay well let's take a break now and
200:08
we'll come back and go over the reading
200:09
together
200:28
[Music]
200:38
hello everybody welcome back to reading
200:40
for vocabulary we're on unit 4 we're
200:43
talking about world connections
200:46
lesson 10 is talking about going places
200:50
how about you have you traveled in your
200:52
life or have you moved your house from
200:55
one place to another maybe you grew up
200:58
in one city and moved and lived in
201:00
another city
201:02
well we're going to focus on the history
201:05
of transportation right because human
201:08
beings have been around for a very long
201:10
time and human beings like to travel
201:13
right it's part of who we are okay so
201:16
that's what we're going to talk about in
201:18
this lesson but first let's learn some
201:21
vocabulary words the first word we're
201:23
going to go over wow this is very
201:26
exciting right it's going very fast of
201:28
course this is what kind of thing it's a
201:31
long vehicle a long it's very long
201:35
vehicle that travels on rails these are
201:39
rails what do we call that of course you
201:42
know it's called a train right korea has
201:45
a very good train system ktx right the
201:48
bullet train it's very fast you can go
201:51
from seoul to busan in three and a half
201:54
hours very good okay but that's a train
201:58
okay the second word here anything
202:00
anything that carries people over land
202:04
water or sea of course we can see a
202:06
plane here we talked about train but
202:09
we're talking about anything it could be
202:11
a plane a train a car a boat
202:15
all of these things what do we call
202:16
these things they carry people over land
202:19
water or sea carry people anywhere in
202:22
the world we call this system
202:25
transportation
202:29
long word so trans
202:32
poor
202:36
four syllables let's say it a little bit
202:38
more quickly though like a native
202:40
speaker
202:41
transportation
202:43
transportation
202:45
okay transportation okay that is
202:48
basically anything that carries people
202:51
from one place to another but
202:53
transportation is usually thought of as
202:55
a system right or uh a type of uh
202:59
vehicle right it's a type for example a
203:02
train is a type of transportation a
203:06
plane is a type of transportation so
203:10
when we talk about transportation we're
203:12
not talking about one vehicle or a
203:14
specific vehicle we're talking about
203:17
any all types of vehicles anything okay
203:21
but if you're going to talk about
203:22
specific type then say boat or car train
203:26
or plane but you could also
203:28
to use transportation you can say
203:31
transportation is very good in korea for
203:34
example the transportation system is
203:37
very good in korea okay next one
203:40
three whoa what's this this looks a
203:42
little strange but if you look carefully
203:45
and closely you get it pretty quickly of
203:48
course you find this in your car if your
203:51
family has a car of course probably do
203:54
you open the hood of the car and you can
203:57
see this this is what makes the car go
204:00
it's a machine that provides power it
204:03
provides power to your car right it's
204:06
called an engine but engines of course
204:09
are also in trains they're in planes and
204:12
they're in automobiles right planes
204:14
trains and automobiles boats all types
204:16
of transportation
204:18
not all types a bicycle is a type of
204:20
transportation but it doesn't have an
204:22
engine right so you think of the
204:24
powerful types of transportation they
204:27
have an engine but other types of
204:29
transportation that are slower we use
204:32
our our power human power or animal
204:35
power horses and carts right but most
204:38
modern transportation
204:40
uses an engine
204:42
okay next one well this is very
204:44
interesting it's very key upg
204:46
car right a very cute car
204:48
useful and sensible so this is a useful
204:52
car it's sensible because it doesn't
204:54
waste a lot of gas it only uses enough
204:57
gas that it needs so we say something is
205:00
practical it's practical it's enough to
205:03
get the job done we don't waste time we
205:06
don't waste money it's practical okay
205:09
useful and sensible
205:13
next one a great achievement something
205:16
that is a great achievement we say it is
205:19
a feat not your pal right
205:22
not feet f-e-e-t but feet
205:26
f-e-a-t pronunciation is the same as
205:31
feet right but
205:33
feet means achievement if you have done
205:36
something spectacular you have done
205:38
something great maybe you won an award
205:41
that was a great feat you accomplished
205:44
an impressive
205:45
feat f-e-a-t not
205:48
nam se right not not that okay not feet
205:52
okay next one
205:53
six to move through the sky on the wind
205:57
so birds do this some kinds of airplanes
206:00
do this
206:01
people can do this too if they have a
206:03
certain device
206:05
it's called a hang glider but anyway
206:08
when birds are doing this they're not
206:09
moving their wings they're just have
206:11
their wings out and the wind helps them
206:14
keep in the air and they're just
206:16
floating they're like floating around
206:18
we say they are soaring to soar some
206:21
types of airplanes right they don't have
206:23
an engine they go up in the air they're
206:25
being pulled up in the air by another
206:27
plane and then they're released and then
206:29
they just kind of glide down back to the
206:32
earth they're soaring through the air to
206:34
soar
206:36
a vehicle that travels through the air i
206:38
was talking about it already quite a lot
206:41
i've mentioned it already many times of
206:43
course it is an a plane or an aircraft
206:47
so remember we can say airplane or just
206:50
plane we can also say aircraft it's a
206:53
vehicle that travels through the air now
206:56
aircraft many different types of
206:59
aircraft right a hang glider
207:02
you can say is a type of aircraft but
207:05
it's not a plane
207:07
a hang glider right that's where the
207:10
people get in they just have a bar and
207:11
there's this big
207:13
wing above them and they just float they
207:15
soar through the air right that's a type
207:17
of aircraft but mostly we're talking
207:19
about planes
207:21
mostly when we talk about aircraft we're
207:22
talking about planes and of course
207:24
passenger planes fighter jet planes
207:28
small stunt planes
207:31
there's many different types of planes
207:34
okay
207:35
hot water in the air when you cook tea
207:38
when you cook tea when you make tea when
207:40
you make don't say cooked when you make
207:42
tea
207:43
of course you want the water to boil
207:46
right so hot water will come out in the
207:48
air once it's boiling and we call that
207:51
steam be careful right steam apa right
207:54
joshua be careful because steam can be
207:57
dangerous right of course in this
207:59
situation maybe not so dangerous but in
208:02
a factory or something be careful right
208:04
because there's a lot of steam there can
208:06
be a lot of steam
208:08
nine to make disappear and then appear
208:11
in a different place to make something
208:13
disappear and then disappear here and
208:16
then make it appear in another place so
208:18
basically i move it from here to there
208:20
very quickly this is not real we only
208:23
see this in science fiction movies
208:25
nowadays of course star trek was very
208:28
famous for their what teleporter
208:31
teleporter okay they could teleport
208:34
people uh from their ship to the planet
208:38
down below
208:39
okay so that's called teleport
208:41
that's not real it's only in our
208:43
imagination nobody can do this yet
208:46
people are trying to figure out how to
208:48
do it but it's not possible to do it now
208:51
okay teleport
208:53
okay
208:54
next one a vehicle that can travel into
208:57
space what is that of course you're very
209:00
excited about reading about these and
209:02
hearing about these astronauts will go
209:04
into space on these vehicles they are
209:07
also a type of aircraft but we call them
209:10
a rocket
209:11
rocket okay so a rocket is a type of
209:15
aircraft right we saw that word before
209:17
many types of aircraft mostly we talk
209:19
about planes but rocket is also another
209:22
type of aircraft but this one goes into
209:25
space
209:26
okay
209:28
remember i was talking to you about this
209:30
one before i wrote it on the
209:32
board board
209:33
a one or two person aircraft with no
209:37
engine
209:38
it is a hang glider i taught that to you
209:41
before this is a very interesting very
209:44
exciting aircraft right it's a little
209:46
dangerous right
209:48
if you do this you have to be an adult
209:50
to do this and you have to have a lot of
209:52
training to be able to do this but this
209:55
is very amazing isn't it it would be
209:56
really cool to be able to do this and
209:58
this is a one or two person two people
210:01
can sometimes fly in it there's no
210:03
engine you jump off a mountain and you
210:06
fly you soar through the air
210:09
next one a thing that spins and pulls
210:11
air or water so on older airplanes on
210:15
older airplanes there we have this this
210:18
is called a propeller
210:21
propeller propeller
210:24
propeller that might be a little
210:26
difficult to pronounce
210:27
pro
210:29
pel
210:30
er
210:31
propeller
210:32
and these are of course on older
210:35
airplanes right nowadays most airplanes
210:37
use jet engines
210:40
jets
210:41
most airplanes are jets nowadays
210:43
especially the big airplanes that you
210:45
travel to another country they use jets
210:48
but smaller airplanes and older
210:50
airplanes they'll use propellers
210:52
okay next one
210:54
a basic vehicle with four wheels right
210:57
before when i was talking about engines
210:59
right not all transportation has engines
211:02
there's no engine on this vehicle right
211:06
but what do we call this we call this a
211:08
carriage
211:10
carriage carriage now you may know about
211:13
carriages from fairy tales right when
211:15
you read the fairy tale about cinderella
211:18
right a carriage comes to take her to
211:20
the ball and then the carriage comes is
211:23
supposed to bring her back home before
211:25
it turns into the little mice and the
211:27
pumpkin right so we know about carriages
211:29
from fairy tales carriages were very
211:32
common hundreds of years ago before the
211:35
invention of the car rich people would
211:38
ride around in carriages
211:41
okay
211:43
a fuel that powers cars of course if you
211:47
are with your mom or dad you're driving
211:49
around they have to stop at a jew you
211:51
saw right a gas station once in a while
211:54
so a fuel that powers car is gas gas
211:58
station in korean you say juju soil
212:00
right but we say gas station in america
212:04
in england in britain they say petrol
212:09
petrol so british english they will say
212:12
i need some petrol for my car but
212:14
americans don't use the word petrol they
212:17
if you say petrol in america people will
212:19
know what you're talking about but they
212:22
hardly ever use that word so think well
212:24
that's kind of strange did you learn
212:25
english in britain right so most
212:28
americans will say just gas i need gas
212:30
for my car let's go to a gas station
212:34
british people say we need to get some
212:35
petrol let's go to a petrol station okay
212:38
so gas
212:40
next one
212:41
a large balloon filled with hot air that
212:44
carries people okay this is also very
212:47
exciting that would be fun to ride in
212:49
right
212:50
of course it's a safer than a hang
212:52
glider right you don't have to have as
212:53
much training you just have to be with a
212:56
person who knows what he's doing or
212:57
she's doing so what we call this we call
213:00
this a hot air balloon and of course we
213:03
see all the words there hot air balloon
213:06
right it's a big balloon not a balloon
213:08
that you hold in your hand at a birthday
213:10
party no this is really big and it uses
213:13
hot air to go up in the sky right so
213:17
it's a hot air balloon
213:20
okay last one
213:22
having to do with sunlight so these are
213:25
becoming more and more popular these
213:27
days right this is like future
213:29
technology maybe the future will depend
213:33
on this type of technology what are
213:36
these these are like panels
213:38
panel
213:40
right a panel is just a flat surface
213:43
right but these are what kinds of panel
213:46
they have to do with sunlight we call
213:48
them solar
213:49
panels but this word here is an
213:52
adjective and we use that word in front
213:55
of anything that uses sunlight solar
213:59
panel solar
214:01
car
214:02
solar uh whatever okay
214:04
this is an adjective that we use in
214:07
front of nouns to describe that they
214:10
have to do with sunlight or usually
214:12
nowadays that they get their energy from
214:15
the sun solar panel gets its energy from
214:18
the sun from sunlight
214:20
okay those are our words let's go over
214:23
the exercises for that vocabulary
214:26
the first problem here is after a hot
214:29
shower hot shower is good in the morning
214:32
on a winter day isn't it okay a hot
214:34
shower the bathroom air fills with what
214:38
so of course if it's winter you're
214:40
taking a hot shower in the morning or at
214:42
night before you go to bed well actually
214:44
that's
214:45
may make you go to sleep but anyway in
214:47
the bathroom you notice i can't see
214:49
right if you have glass you have to wipe
214:52
the glass why because the water is hot
214:56
it gets in the air and what do we call
214:58
that is it gas is it smoke is it steam
215:01
or is it soap
215:03
okay we might say oh it's smoke no it's
215:06
not smoke smoke is from a fire right
215:08
this is water water vapor it's not gas
215:12
it's not soap right be careful don't get
215:14
soap in your eyes what is it of course
215:16
we know it's steam right hot air
215:20
sorry water that gets very hot hot water
215:23
if it's very hot it will become steam
215:26
and of course when you're taking a hot
215:28
shower there's a lot of steam in the
215:30
bathroom if you go to a sauna there's a
215:32
lot of steam people like it it's healthy
215:35
for them okay
215:36
three a hammer is not very beep for
215:40
cooking food so we're talking about
215:43
something that is useful
215:45
or sensible to use for something else do
215:49
we use a hammer to cook food a hammer we
215:53
use to pound a nail into wood you don't
215:56
use a hammer for cooking food that's
215:58
crazy right
216:00
so how do we use that though as an
216:02
adjective a hammer is not very beep is
216:05
not
216:06
very what for cooking food
216:09
so it's not
216:10
a silly be practical c big d useless
216:15
remember the word not here
216:17
if we said a hammer is not very silly
216:20
you might choose silly because oh that's
216:22
silly to use a hammer for cooking food
216:24
but we're using not so not silly means
216:27
that it's okay
216:29
but that's not right a hammer is not
216:31
okay to use for cooking food so silly
216:34
doesn't work what about practical not
216:37
practical ah not practical practical
216:40
means useful sensible right a hammer is
216:43
not pro not practical it's not useful
216:46
it's not sensible so that's our answer b
216:49
is not big that doesn't
216:51
fit and useless remember not
216:54
not useless if we got rid of not we said
216:57
a hammer is useless for cooking food
217:00
that's okay if we said a hammer is silly
217:04
for cooking food that would be okay
217:07
but we're using not so the adjective has
217:10
to be appropriate not practical for
217:13
cooking food it's not useful okay
217:16
okay next one five we took the beep
217:20
it was faster than the car or bus and
217:23
cheaper than a plane
217:24
so that's interesting this uh problem
217:28
kind of eliminates
217:30
choices for you so you took something in
217:34
other words you took some type of
217:35
transportation we take transportation
217:38
you can take a plane you can take a boat
217:40
you can take a taxi you can take a car
217:42
or whatever so we take some type of
217:44
transportation
217:47
but what kind of transportation well we
217:49
know what it's not we know it's not a
217:52
car not a bus and we know it's not a
217:55
plane okay
217:57
but we also know a couple more clues it
218:00
was faster than faster than a car faster
218:03
than a bus
218:05
not faster than a plane just cheaper
218:08
than a plane interesting so those are
218:10
the clues not a car not a bus not a
218:12
plane faster than a car faster than a
218:14
bus and cheaper not as expensive as a
218:17
plane what could it be our choices are
218:19
horse rocket train or bicycle well let's
218:23
look at them a horse is a horse faster
218:26
than a car or a bus
218:28
no of course not cars are much faster
218:30
than horses they can go much longer
218:32
distances and much quicker so it's not a
218:35
horse
218:36
a rocket
218:38
okay faster than a car bus yeah a rocket
218:40
is faster than a car or bus is it
218:42
cheaper than a plane no rockets are
218:45
really really expensive okay you have to
218:47
be a millionaire to go into space on a
218:50
rocket if you're going to pay for it
218:52
okay what about a train a train is
218:54
faster than a car bus that's true it's
218:57
cheaper than a plane yeah train tickets
218:59
are usually a lot cheaper than plane
219:02
tickets that's our answer train we took
219:05
the train faster than a car bus and
219:08
cheaper than a plane it's not faster
219:10
than a plane it's just cheaper than a
219:12
plane
219:13
and bicycle we know bicycles not faster
219:17
than a car or bus so that's not the
219:19
answer either
219:20
okay number seven rockets are the
219:22
fastest beep in the world rockets are
219:26
the fastest what our choices are trains
219:29
b aircraft c flight d steam so right
219:33
away we see that flight doesn't work
219:35
because flight is not a type of vehicle
219:39
neither is steam steam is not a type of
219:41
vehicle that leaves us with trains or
219:44
aircrafts is a rocket a type of train
219:47
no it's not a type of train it's a type
219:50
of aircraft so rockets are the fastest
219:53
aircraft in the world remember i said
219:55
before aircraft there are many many
219:58
different types of aircraft planes hang
220:01
gliders and also rockets okay well that
220:04
wraps up the vocabulary section for this
220:07
unit let's take a short break we'll come
220:09
back and look at the reading don't go
220:11
away
220:30
[Music]
220:39
hello everybody welcome back to reading
220:42
for vocabulary are you interested in
220:44
continuing our subject here we're of
220:46
course on unit 4 we're talking about
220:49
world connections so it's very
220:51
interesting looking at different places
220:54
around the world and also thinking about
220:56
how people have traveled from place to
220:58
place in lesson 11 we're talking about a
221:01
quick bite to eat so we're not going to
221:04
be focusing on transportation we're
221:06
going to be talking about fast food
221:09
because of course in our lives as we're
221:12
very busy traveling from place to place
221:15
it's very easy to get food very quickly
221:17
and we're talking about fast food in
221:19
this section so that will be our reading
221:21
passage but again of course we need to
221:23
study the vocabulary that we will
221:25
encounter in the passage so let's begin
221:28
the first word on our list today is a
221:32
difficulty or an issue so if you have a
221:36
difficulty or if there's some issue that
221:38
you have to deal with we call that a
221:41
problem
221:42
problem now it's very interesting
221:44
because i'd like to point out something
221:46
problem
221:47
and issue have become
221:50
kind of
221:51
not interchangeable but
221:53
substituted in america many people will
221:56
say issue
221:59
instead of saying problem for example
222:02
why because problem is negative
222:06
issue sounds more neutral so for example
222:09
americans instead of saying do you have
222:12
a problem they will say is there an
222:14
issue with this because do you have a
222:17
problem is very direct and sounds
222:20
negative but if you change it and you
222:23
say is there an issue with this
222:26
whatever then that sounds more neutral
222:29
it doesn't sound as
222:31
rude and it doesn't sound as negative so
222:34
it's very interesting i've noticed over
222:36
maybe the last 10 or 20 years that
222:39
americans have stopped using problem
222:41
especially in like polite situations
222:44
like business situations or things like
222:46
that
222:47
people have stopped using problem and
222:49
they're starting to use the word issue
222:51
much more often because problem sounds
222:54
negative and problem is negative if you
222:56
have a problem with something that is a
222:58
negative situation
223:01
issue though can be sounds more neutral
223:04
or not as negative okay next one
223:07
two
223:08
where and how something began so we
223:10
think about a game like chess or we
223:13
think about a certain type of dress or a
223:16
certain type of doing things where did
223:18
it begin what was the origin
223:21
origin where did it start where did it
223:24
begin that's the origin how and where
223:27
something began
223:29
number three
223:31
able to be used or taken able to be used
223:34
or taken we say it's available
223:37
if
223:38
there is a seat empty in a restaurant
223:41
you can say is this seat available can i
223:44
sit there can i use it can i take it
223:47
if you go somewhere and you want to be
223:49
able to
223:51
use a piece of equipment for example you
223:53
go to a bowling alley and there's some
223:55
shoes on the shelf are they available
223:57
yes you can use those shoes to go
224:00
bowling right so are they available you
224:02
can use them or you can take them it is
224:05
available
224:06
next one to ask for an item or meal from
224:11
a business when you go to the restaurant
224:13
and you ask for an item or you ask for a
224:17
meal right what are you doing what do
224:18
you it's called an order i think you say
224:21
in korean jumun jumun haseo have you
224:24
ordered have you ordered
224:27
would you like to order or if i'm a
224:30
waiter right i say to the customer would
224:32
you like to order are you ready to order
224:35
now if i'm the customer i say excuse me
224:38
i would like to order now this is my
224:41
order okay so order you ask for an item
224:44
or a meal from a business not just in a
224:47
restaurant item if you're online you're
224:50
doing internet shopping then you also
224:52
can order products from a business order
224:55
an item some type of product so that we
224:58
say order that's a specific verb for
225:00
that action
225:02
five easy and quick to do law is very
225:04
convenient that word just kind of slid
225:06
right on in there very conveniently
225:09
right it was easy and quick to do it's
225:12
convenient modern life is very
225:14
convenient isn't it we just hit
225:17
some keys on our keyboard and somebody
225:19
comes to our door and gives us a package
225:22
wow how convenient is that we don't even
225:25
have to leave our house anymore to get
225:27
items from the store okay next one
225:31
possibly dangerous not joking
225:34
these two men do they look happy
225:37
well no they don't look happy doesn't
225:39
look like their team of course they're
225:41
dressed very funnily they're sports fans
225:43
obviously but they don't look happy they
225:46
look very serious they're not joking
225:50
and
225:51
it says possibly dangerous but i don't
225:53
want to say that these guys are possibly
225:54
dangerous but other situations can be
225:58
described as serious for example
226:01
conditions outside weather conditions
226:03
are serious
226:04
that could be possibly dangerous if you
226:06
hear that on the news be careful
226:08
if the tv or the radio announcer says
226:11
weather conditions are serious that
226:13
means there's a lot of snow maybe
226:14
there's ice or maybe there's a lot of
226:16
rain and there's a possibility of
226:18
flooding it could be dangerous so there
226:20
are serious weather conditions outside
226:23
but sirius doesn't always mean dangerous
226:25
it can mean by like these guys they're
226:28
not joking they're not happy they're
226:30
thinking about something very hard
226:32
they're very serious but i wouldn't say
226:34
these guys are dangerous
226:36
okay it depends on the situation okay
226:39
next one
226:41
taking almost no time to make what is
226:43
this of course that's ramyan right it
226:45
takes almost no time to make
226:48
in america people will usually say
226:50
instant instant ramen or another word
226:53
for ramyun is instant noodles okay but
226:57
we use the word instant because it takes
226:59
almost no time to make
227:02
now a long time ago when you if you
227:04
wanted to have noodle soup you had to
227:07
take a lot of time you had to buy the
227:08
noodles you had to cook them boil them
227:11
for a long time you know with water and
227:13
then go and get other spices and put
227:15
that in it took a while to make that but
227:17
with instant ramyan all you do is
227:20
heat water pour the water in there
227:23
keep it
227:24
closed for about a minute open it up and
227:26
eat it it's almost no time to make you
227:28
don't have to worry it's already
227:30
prepackaged it's already prepared for
227:33
you okay so it's very instant you can
227:35
make it very quickly instant
227:38
eight
227:39
throughout the world so something that
227:42
is spread throughout the world is
227:45
wide and we use this
227:48
suffix this ending for the word uh quite
227:52
a bit right worldwide
227:54
company wide throughout the entire
227:57
company

region-wide nationwide
228:01
throughout the region throughout the
228:02
nation and of course we're talking about
228:04
the whole world worldwide so why it is a
228:08
common ending
228:09
especially at the end of it some type of
228:11
area nation region company and when
228:14
you're talking about an area to mean
228:16
that it's throughout the entire
228:18
area throughout the world throughout the
228:21
company throughout the nation worldwide
228:23

228:37

228:39

228:43
specialized in growing these right what
228:45
is it what kind of fruit it's a
228:47
pineapple
228:49
pine apple of course they're not apples
228:51

228:56
sure where the word pineapple came from
228:58
but it's a special kind of fruit that
229:00
grows in tropical countries pineapple
229:04
good good snack uh good food for a snack
229:07
okay next one
229:09

229:11
a lot of foods that you eat especially
229:13
if you go to like a restaurant like tgi
229:15
fridays or some other place like that
229:18
and you have chicken wings
229:19
they usually have some other it's like a
229:22
liquid it's a very thick liquid right
229:25
it's not a liquid it's not like water
229:27
although some can be thin
229:30
it's called a sauce
229:31
a sauce usually they're kind of thick
229:33
and you dip your food into it right a
229:35
liquid that goes with goes with another
229:38
food so you either dip your liquid into

229:46
next one
229:48
speed in action

this person is in a hurry in
229:54
a
229:55

moving quickly they're walking quickly
230:03
they're acting or you can it doesn't
230:05
even mean they're moving from one place
230:07

desk working
230:10
quickly you are in a hurry so in a hurry
230:14
means to do something quickly or it
230:16
means to do something uh very fast okay
230:20
next one
230:21
the amount of food eaten for one meal
230:24
so if you only eat one of these bowls
230:26
and that's your entire meal we call that
230:29
a serving
230:30
one serving
230:33
usually people will say i will well it's
230:36
actually not usually just say i'll have
230:39
the steak and fries that's one serving
230:42
of a steak and fries or i'll have a bowl
230:45
of soup that's one serving if you want
230:48
two servings that means you have another
230:51
bowl of soup so one serving two servings
230:54
there are two servings here so the
230:56
amount of food eaten for one meal okay
231:01
sometimes people will have a lot of
231:03
servings for their meal right but it's a
231:04
serving okay it's typical but some
231:07
people are so hungry they want more than
231:09
the typical amount so they have another
231:11
serving okay
231:14
13. a business that has many copies of
231:17
its stores of course you guys know
231:19
mcdonald's mcdonald's is everywhere
231:21
right they're in almost every i think
231:22
they're in every country except for
231:24
north korea uh but they're almost
231:26
everywhere in the world right
231:28
a business that has many copies of its
231:30
stores
231:31
we call mcdonald's a chain store and
231:34
there are many types of chain stores of
231:35
course mcdonald's is perhaps the most
231:38
famous one because it's the most popular
231:40
one but there's other different
231:42
restaurants i mentioned tgi fridays
231:44
before tj friday's is a chain restaurant
231:47
outback is a chain restaurant but it's
231:49
not just restaurants it can also be
231:51
stores right for example you could have
231:54
like macy's macy's could be a chain
231:57
store in different in different cities
231:59
right because they're a large department
232:01
store they're not just in new york there
232:03
are also many other cities in america
232:06
so a department store could be a chain
232:08
store
232:10
lots of different businesses that have
232:12
shops in different areas or different
232:14
regions they are also called chain
232:17
stores
232:18
okay the next word here is kind of funny
232:20
cow meat now of course we don't say cow
232:23
meat in america that's a very strange
232:25
word it's kind of like saying
232:27
pada gogi for fish right that sounds
232:29
weird no you say bulgogi or you say
232:32
sangsan right
232:33
so you have special words for different
232:35
types of meat and if you i mean if you
232:38
say cow meat in america people will
232:40
understand they'll just think oh that
232:42
sounds funny it's like me going into a
232:44
restaurant and saying yes i would like
232:46
some pada gogi please the restaurant
232:48
people will probably understand what i
232:50
mean but they'll think well this
232:51
american is strange you know some weird
232:53
korean right so don't go to america and
232:55
say i'd like some cow meat right say you
232:57
would like some beef right so gogi is
233:00
beef in english okay
233:03
okay next one is 15
233:05
what you put on top of food so things
233:07
that you put on top of food especially
233:10
on top of ice cream right that's these
233:13
are
233:13
probably things that you put on top of
233:15
ice cream you get hungry
233:17
we call them toppings right so
233:19
especially if you go to a place
233:21
like baskin robbins sometimes they'll
233:23
have different toppings on your ice
233:25
cream but especially cold stone
233:28
near the cold stone ice cream chain
233:30
store they have many different toppings
233:33
that you can put on your food it's not
233:35
just ice cream
233:36
again it could be a meal it could be
233:39
steak it could be pasta
233:41
what is the topping that you put on
233:43
especially pizza when you think about
233:44
pizza has many different toppings and
233:47
you choose which topping you want on
233:50
your food
233:51
next one is 16 made ready to use before
233:55
it's needed so if you make something
233:58
now but you don't need it now you need
234:01
it an hour from now or you need it maybe
234:03
tomorrow what do you do
234:06
it's prepared
234:07
you prepare that food so after you
234:10
prepare it it is prepared
234:12
and by the way it's not just food
234:14
okay you could prepare other things for
234:17
example you could prepare your homework
234:20
the night before it's due is your
234:22
homework done yes it's prepared for
234:25
tomorrow so something that's prepared is
234:28
made ready to use before it's needed
234:32
the teacher doesn't need your homework
234:34
at 10 o'clock at night right the teacher
234:37
needs your homework the next morning but
234:39
you should prepare it the night before
234:42
so it's done your mother does the same
234:44
thing when she cooks meals right
234:46
many moms will will prepare meals
234:48
they'll put them in the refrigerator and
234:50
then take them out and warm them up for
234:52
the dinner because many moms are busy
234:55
these days sometimes though they'll
234:57
prepare a meal for a few hours before
235:00
dinner time right so they might start
235:02
cooking at four pm but you don't eat
235:05
until six
235:06
right so that's prepared they prepared
235:09
the meal for you okay
235:12
let's go over the words what uh what are
235:15
the words that we've just learned how
235:16
well do you remember them let's go over
235:18
the exercises
235:19
the first one number one i beep a new
235:22
sweater it will come in the mail soon it
235:25
will come
235:27
in the mail soon
235:28
so if what do you do you know a new
235:31
sweater could be anything really but you
235:33
it'll come in the mail soon what word
235:35
did we talk about that would fit here a
235:38
grabbed b made c ordered d sold well a
235:43
grab just means to go and grab something
235:46
if you grabbed a new sweater
235:48
it's not going to come in the mail soon
235:49
you have it in your hand you grabbed it
235:51
right so and you shouldn't grab things
235:54
that's not polite okay so not grabbed b
235:57
i made a new sweater if you made this
235:59
sweater you have it right it's not going
236:01
to come in the mail you have it now so
236:03
made doesn't fit
236:04
i ordered a new sweater ah that makes
236:07
sense right you ordered the sweater on
236:09
the computer or you order it on the
236:11
phone and then the company will send it
236:13
to you in the mail so that's the answer
236:16
i ordered a new sweater it will come in
236:18
the mail soon what about d i sold a new
236:21
sweater i sold a new sweater that
236:23
doesn't make sense because it will come
236:26
if you sell a sweater you're going to
236:27
send it through the mail it's not going
236:29
to come to you you're going to send it
236:31
away so that doesn't make sense okay
236:34
number three i'm sorry but we have no
236:37
tables
236:38
beep okay remember when we talked about
236:40
this word i use the example of the chair
236:43
if there is a chair that is empty that
236:45
you can use it right it is what well the
236:48
same thing about a table you go into a
236:50
restaurant and there's an empty table
236:52
right nobody is sitting there then that
236:55
table is what but if you go in the
236:57
restaurant the waiter says i'm sorry but
236:59
we have no tables
237:02
for your use no tables out no tables
237:05
instant no tables serious or no tables
237:08
available well right away we can see
237:10
available i'm sorry but we have no
237:13
tables available no tables are ready for
237:16
your use not out
237:19
not instant that doesn't make sense and
237:21
not we have no tables that are serious
237:24
that's just silly right so i'm sorry but
237:26
we have no tables available this one we
237:29
see right away uh no tables that are
237:32
ready for your use no tables available
237:36
six that was a beep test i don't know it
237:40
would be so hard and of course we have a
237:42
or an because some of the answers start
237:45
with about one answer starts with a
237:47
vowel so what was it
237:49
that was a what kind of test a what kind
237:51
of test
237:52
is a hard test what kind of test is a
237:55
hard test a difficult test
237:59
right
238:01
right
238:02
a quick test no
238:05
hard tests are not quick
238:08
b a convenient test convenient means
238:10
easy so that's not true it's a hard test
238:13
it's an instant test instant and quick
238:15
are similar right but that doesn't make
238:17
sense it was a serious yeah it was a
238:20
serious test it was difficult remember
238:22
serious doesn't always mean dangerous a
238:25
test cannot be dangerous but it can be
238:29
very difficult
238:30
or severe right serious it can be a
238:34
serious test that teacher is not joking
238:37
around the teacher is very serious about
238:40
us
238:41
learning the material so that was a
238:44
serious test it was a difficult test
238:47
seven
238:47
don't forget
238:50
right don't forget
238:52
dogs had their beep as wolves
238:56
now this one is interesting you have to
238:58
think about this a little bit
239:00
um
239:01
but what you need to know of course and
239:03
i mentioned this in a previous lesson a
239:04
long time ago
239:06
all dogs all modern dogs now
239:09
came from wolves right so all modern
239:13
dogs descended from wolves you think
239:15
about your your dog at home right
239:17
whether it's a beagle or it's a husky a
239:20
big dog you know
239:22
their ancestors were wolves a long time
239:25
ago there were no dogs that people had
239:27
as pets there were wolves and all those
239:29
wolves their babies after many
239:31
generations
239:33
evolved into different types of dogs
239:36
dogs that people have in their homes so
239:39
dogs had their what
239:41
as wolves as their future had their
239:43
origin had their problem or had their
239:45
mistake
239:46
well remember how and where some or how
239:48
and when or where something got started
239:50
is their origin
239:52
how did dogs come about well their
239:54
origin
239:55
is wolves right after thousands of years
239:59
of breeding human beings have
240:02
helped wolves will help wolves or made
240:05
wolves evolve into dogs right so um the
240:09
origin but all dogs came from wolf so
240:11
dogs origin is wolves not future that
240:13
doesn't make sense not problem that's
240:16
weird and mistake problem and mistake
240:18
are similar but they don't fit here the
240:20
best word of course is origin all modern
240:23
dogs had their origin as wolves very
240:26
interesting
240:27
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
240:30
part of this lesson let's take a short
240:32
break we'll come back and let's go over
240:33
the reading passage together so don't go
240:35
away
240:54
[Music]
241:04
hello everybody welcome back to reading
241:06
for vocabulary are you ready to begin
241:08
studying
241:10
the topic for today is kind of
241:12
interesting and you've probably
241:14
experienced it in your life right we're
241:17
talking about a home away from home a
241:20
home away from home
241:22
we're going to focus on
241:24
moving to a new home
241:27
have you ever moved in your life right
241:29
did you move to a new apartment or a new
241:32
house maybe you move to a new
241:34
neighborhood or a new city or maybe even
241:37
a new country right so people nowadays
241:41
move a lot
241:42
right you think about it uh and you know
241:45
sir there are some people who live in
241:47
one place all their life but it's
241:49
becoming more and more common for people
241:51
to move to different places and live in
241:53
a few different places when they grow up
241:56
i probably am a very extreme example of
242:00
that by the time i finished high school
242:03
i had moved about five times my family
242:07
moved about five times why
242:09
because my father is a jiji
242:12
right a geologist a geologist so his
242:15
company
242:16
sent him giallo just a geologist his
242:20
company sent him to many different
242:22
places in the world so when i was
242:24
growing up
242:25
you know i lived in new mexico wisconsin
242:28
north carolina papua new guinea
242:31
colorado arizona nevada we moved so many
242:36
different times because of my dad's job
242:39
so maybe your dad's job or your mom's
242:41
job takes you to different places or
242:43
maybe when you go to school when you go
242:45
to college you might go to another city
242:47
or maybe even a different country by the
242:49
way if you get a chance to go to another
242:52
country to study for college take that
242:55
chance look for that opportunity it's a
242:57
very good experience for you anyway
243:00
that's the topic moving to new homes so
243:02
nowadays it's not unusual for us to
243:04
think of any place can be a new home we
243:07
can move just about anywhere and live
243:09
anywhere so that's what we're going to
243:11
read about but first let's take a look
243:12
at the vocabulary
243:14
our first word is
243:17
new york loves ugly
243:19
that's not our first word it's just an
243:21
interesting
243:22
t-shirt a person whose home
243:26
is in a certain area
243:28
so new york of course is a very famous
243:32
town they're very famous for their
243:33
spirit right uh people who live in new
243:36
york they can call themselves citizens
243:38
of new york okay usually though we use
243:41
citizen for country for example people
243:44
who live in new york are citizens of
243:46
america they are american citizens
243:48
people who live in seoul are usually
243:51
korean citizens right if your if your
243:54
passport has the name of the country
243:58
on it right you were a citizen of that
244:00
country if you have a korean passport
244:02
you are a citizen of korea if you are
244:04
have an american passport you are a
244:06
citizen of america and the same for
244:09
every country in the world so which
244:12
country are you a citizen of
244:14
okay next one
244:17
do you know this place machu picchu
244:20
this is an event that a person goes
244:22
through if you go visit a world famous
244:24
place like this uh what do you say it's
244:28
an
244:30
up an experience an
244:32
experience so if you go and see machu
244:35
picchu in peru or you go see the
244:37
pyramids in egypt or you go see the
244:40
eiffel tower in paris france that is an
244:43
experience that you will remember
244:46
experience
244:48
experience
244:50
experience
244:51
experience okay so uh probably you have
244:55
good experiences of traveling maybe your
244:57
family has taken vacations to different
245:00
places right you have good experiences
245:03
of your traveling
245:05
next one to fit in naturally to fit in
245:07
naturally means to belong of course
245:11
these apples do they belong together you
245:13
might say well the red one doesn't
245:14
belong but maybe it does it depends on
245:17
how you look at it they're all apples
245:20
right so it belongs together because
245:22
they're all apples but maybe other
245:24
people say it doesn't belong because
245:26
it's red and the others are green but to
245:29
fit in naturally means to belong
245:30
somewhere it belongs with the others of
245:33
course if you go to the supermarket
245:35
apples are in one section sure you have
245:37
green apples red apples
245:38
yellow apples in different places but
245:41
they're all together kind of in the same
245:43
area they belong in the same area
245:47
this is a
245:48
interesting idea do you know this for a
245:51
type of living thing to change slowly
245:55
over time
245:57
so we think about this when you think
245:58
about the
246:00
the age of the earth how old is the
246:03
earth right
246:05
4.5 billion years old we can't even
246:09
imagine that time how long has life been
246:13
on earth since at least 3.5 billion
246:15
years right now
246:17
over that
246:18
long time life has changed into many
246:21
different forms what do we call that
246:23
process this is usually the the picture
246:25
that they usually show how accurate it
246:27
is you know maybe we don't know but it
246:30
shows that monkey-like creatures
246:33
changing slowly into human beings we say
246:37
evolve
246:39
now of course monkeys did not evolve
246:42
into human beings monkeys are cousins to
246:45
human beings this creature doesn't live
246:48
anymore it's extinct it's gone
246:51
but all living creatures have evolved
246:54
over time into different forms and
246:56
shapes if you look at horses go back and
246:59
look at the evolutionary history of
247:00
horses or very interesting look at
247:02
whales it's very interesting how whales
247:05
their ancestors came on land and then
247:07
went back to the sea they evolved they
247:10
changed over time so it's a very
247:12
interesting um
247:15
idea about the world and it was first
247:18
evolution was first proposed by darwin
247:20
charles darwin in 1860 something i can't
247:24
remember the exact date but of course
247:26
his his idea was very controversial but
247:28
nowadays most scientists
247:31
more than 90 percent of scientists
247:35
uh say that this is fact it's not a
247:37
theory anymore it actually happened and
247:39
when you think about it it makes sense
247:41
okay so evolve
247:42
okay so next one to create copies of
247:45
oneself so when a uh when adult
247:49
animals have babies what are they doing
247:52
they are reproducing so mama uh mama
247:56
sheep will have a baby sheep right a
247:58
lamb okay so reproduce
248:01
reproduce reproduce reproduce means to
248:04
make copies of oneself okay so
248:08
when animals grow up they become older
248:11
they become adults then they can
248:12
reproduce and have babies of their own
248:15
next one
248:17
to increase okay so something is
248:19
increasing what does it mean it means
248:21
rise so we can see a rise usually we use
248:25
this for charts when we're you know you
248:27
see business people using uh this type
248:29
of graph for to show an increase in
248:31
sales perhaps so they say there's been a
248:34
rise in sales okay a rise to increase
248:37
rise is a verb by the way
248:40
but also a noun
248:42
because i said there has been a rise but
248:44
you could also say sales have
248:46
risen okay rise rose risen
248:51
because as a verb rise is irregular
248:54
we say rise rose risen okay
248:58
but sometimes rise can also be a noun
249:01
okay next one
249:03
wow this is a very probably european
249:06
city very colorful very interesting
249:08
place but if you look at it you also get
249:10
the impression there's so many people
249:12
there wow it's really a lot of people so
249:16
to fill with animals or people is to
249:19
populate
249:20
populate populate so
249:24
you know a long time ago there weren't
249:25
that many people but people you know
249:27
increased the numbers of people
249:29
increased and increased the numbers of
249:31
people rose
249:32
and the earth was populated with human
249:35
beings okay and of course all sorts of
249:37
other types of animals
249:39
next one a group of people sharing
249:42
certain traits and beliefs if we look at
249:45
the american indian here we know that
249:47
american indians share certain beliefs
249:49
and behaviors they do the same things
249:51
and they believe many different things
249:53
of course different tribes have
249:55
different beliefs i'm not saying all
249:56
american indians are the same that's not
249:58
true but a certain group certain tribes
250:00
like the apache or the cherokee or the
250:03
mohican right they would have in their
250:06
tribes they would have the same beliefs
250:08
or the same traditions and of course the
250:10
same is true with countries korean
250:12
culture i gave just gave you the exam
250:15
the answer culture it's a group of
250:17
people who share the same beliefs
250:20
and
250:21
behaviors actually culture when you
250:23
think about a culture isn't really you
250:25
don't say culture is people say culture
250:27
is the beliefs or behaviors of a certain
250:30
group of people right it's what they do
250:33
so korean culture is different from
250:35
american culture which is different from
250:38
french culture okay so different areas
250:41
different groups of people have
250:43
different culture
250:45
or different cultures okay next one
250:47
number nine standing straight not upside
250:50
down so if you're standing straight up
250:52
right you are
250:54
upright up right now this is important
250:57
of course when you're shipping something
250:59
if you're sending something in the mail
251:01
you write on one side of the package or
251:03
this side up right you want it to be
251:05
upright you don't want it to be upside
251:07
down because that could be that could
251:09
possibly damage what you have in the
251:11
container also it's more natural for us
251:13
to be upright right when we're walking
251:15
around we don't walk around on our hands
251:17
upside down that makes our head hurt
251:20
okay next one
251:21
ten a group of people living and working
251:24
together so a group of people living and
251:27
working together what do we call them we
251:30
call that society and we don't society
251:33
is a singular
251:35
now okay society so not it not them but
251:38
it what do we call a group of people
251:40
living and work together what do we call
251:42
it we call it society
251:44
and societies have different sizes right
251:47
a society can be as small as your family
251:49
but usually we talk about society in
251:52
terms of like uh as big as a city or as
251:55
big as a nation or sometimes a global
251:58
society so the entire human population
252:01
in the world we can also think of it as
252:04
a society it depends on what our purpose
252:06
is what is our intention do we just want
252:08
to focus on a small group or are we
252:10
talking about issues that affect a very
252:12
big group so society when we think about
252:14
it can be small or big but usually we
252:16
think about it as the society in which
252:19
we live right what is the uh uh
252:23
you know the the behavior are the
252:25
beliefs or the customs the culture of
252:28
the people that we're living in with
252:29
what is the size of society and of
252:31
course what are the laws of society
252:33
that's something we have to uh think
252:35
about it as well the laws uh what do we
252:38
have to do to obey the laws what are the
252:39
expectations of society what are we
252:42
expected to do in society so society is
252:45
basically the group of people
252:47
in which we live
252:49
okay 11. well what's wrong with these
252:51
people they look very strange
252:53
they have really long legs the the idea
252:55
here is for most of the time for most of
252:58
the time we say generally
253:00
generally so if we talk about basketball
253:03
players we can make general
253:05
statements most of the time basketball
253:07
players are very tall they have very
253:09
long legs that look like golf clubs i'm
253:12
sorry
253:13
no they don't but usually basketball
253:15
players are very tall generally not all
253:18
sometimes you can find short basketball
253:21
players who are very good at passing the
253:23
ball or getting the ball down the court
253:25
but generally
253:27
usually
253:28
for most of the time basketball players
253:30
are very tall and we can make general
253:32
statements about different groups of
253:33
people but again be careful about making
253:36
general statements because you can
253:38
always find exceptions right it's not
253:40
always the same
253:42
okay next one
253:43
a long period of almost no food so these
253:47
people are looking for food and they
253:49
endure a long period when there no food
253:53
has been grown maybe it's too hot
253:55
there's no water so they can't grow food
253:57
we call that time a famine famine is a
254:00
period of time
254:02
that no food is available
254:05
a long time ago of course
254:07
when people couldn't grow crops or there
254:08
were no animals
254:10
to hunt right it was too hot there was
254:12
no water no food so we call that period
254:15
of famine nowadays of course famines can
254:17
be caused by
254:19
the supply chain breaking down right
254:21
people getting food to a certain place
254:23
and that could also cause a famine
254:26
next one wanting to know more so this
254:28
little boy is very curious most children
254:31
are very curious generally children are
254:33
very curious about the world around them
254:35
they are curious they want to know more
254:38
about the world
254:40
okay
254:41
next one to run away from run
254:44
right there's a bull i don't know if you
254:46
can see you can't see the head but this
254:47
is a bull with big horns and these guys
254:50
i think they're in spain perhaps
254:51
pamplona
254:52
where they have every year they run away
254:54
from the bowl which is crazy you know a
254:56
bunch of people will get ready they'll
254:58
release a bull and these guys will run
255:00
down the street running away from a bull
255:03
why
255:04
okay well different people have
255:06
different hobbies i guess okay so to run
255:08
away from means to flee to flee to run
255:12
away now flea is an irregular verb so we
255:14
say flee fled fled
255:17
fled fled
255:18
these men fled from the bowl okay they
255:21
are fleeing from the bowl
255:23
okay next one to come from a source
255:27
now to come from a source it means
255:29
descend to descend and we're talking
255:31
about evolution here it's a strange
255:33
picture but i think what they're getting
255:34
at is that on a chain right there's a
255:37
watch that descends from the chain but
255:40
uh to come from a source we can also
255:42
think think about the word evolution
255:44
remember the picture evolution
255:46
we saw the monkey type creature and then
255:48
we saw a human being so uh usually when
255:51
we especially talk about evolution we
255:54
say that the modern creatures the modern
255:56
animals have descended from
255:59
a previous animal usually not always but
256:03
generally these animals are extinct they
256:05
no longer live that we can't see them
256:08
nowadays sometimes they they still exist
256:11
in certain cases but usually our
256:13
ancestors are extinct right there are no
256:16
more uh
256:18
early humans that are alive people have
256:20
to go and dig up their bones right
256:22
um for the ancestors of human beings but
256:25
we descend from some source from a
256:28
source every living thing has descended
256:30
from one source
256:33
okay next one
256:34
in a single group so in a single group
256:37
we can say together so if the dog and
256:39
the cat are in a single group they look
256:41
like they're friends that's very
256:42
interesting picture
256:44
they're together right they're together
256:46
they're pals they're buddies they're
256:48
together in a group okay so you're
256:50
together with your friends probably when
256:52
you go out to play you're together in a
256:54
group
256:55
okay let's go over the words and see how
256:58
well you remember the vocabulary number
257:00
one hang gliding remember hang gliding
257:03
from a previous lesson right that's
257:04
where you're flying soaring through the
257:06
air onto bar with a wing above you hang
257:09
gliding is a great what a citizen b
257:12
bridge c experience d
257:14
culture
257:16
which word fits well is hank glenning a
257:19
great citizen it's a citizen of a
257:21
country
257:22
that doesn't make sense is it a great
257:24
bridge
257:25
that doesn't make sense either is it a
257:27
great experience remember an experience
257:30
is something that you remember it's a
257:32
memorable happening in your life
257:34
something an event or something that
257:35
happens in your life that's a great
257:37
experience so hang gliding is a great
257:39
experience isn't it because wow that'd
257:41
be great i haven't done it yet i would
257:43
like to someday but it would be a great
257:46
experience and d
257:48
of course hang gliding is not a great
257:49
culture that doesn't make sense hang
257:51
gliding something you do an event that
257:53
you remember it's a great experience or
257:56
it's an experience
257:58
number three
257:59
modern birds beep from dinosaurs okay
258:02
there's actually two words from the
258:04
vocabulary list that we could use here
258:06
but only one of those is here thank
258:08
goodness because if both of them were
258:09
here we would have to choose both but
258:12
there's only one so a populated b
258:14
evolved c reproduced and d created
258:19
let me tell you the word that could fit
258:21
here but not on the answer list and that
258:23
of course is descend
258:25
we could use descended
258:28
descended modern birds descended from
258:31
dinosaurs that would fit but it's not
258:33
one of our choices but remember when i
258:36
was describing or explaining the meaning
258:39
of this word descend we just did this
258:40
right a couple slides ago or i think was
258:43
the last word
258:44
descend
258:45
i said i gave you the example of right
258:49
all living three all living things
258:51
descended from a previous animal and we
258:54
saw that diagram we saw that idea with
258:57
which word of course it was with evolved
259:00
evolve so we could use either word
259:04
modern birds evolved from dinosaurs or
259:07
modern birds descended from dinosaurs it
259:10
means the same thing
259:12
not populated not reproduced not created
259:15
those don't fit we're talking about you
259:17
know a previous life form or a previous
259:20
type of animal
259:21
that gives birth that reproduces but
259:24
over a long time and changes into
259:27
another type of animal and that's
259:30
evolution that's also descending from
259:32
another species or another type of
259:35
animal so modern bird modern birds
259:38
evolve from dinosaurs and by the way
259:39
that's a very interesting idea
259:42
if you think oh dinosaurs are no longer
259:44
in the world they're all extinct
259:46
not true birds are a type of dinosaur
259:49
and we can see them every day very
259:50
interesting
259:52
okay
259:53
five school is strange i don't feel like
259:56
i what i don't feel like i if you think
259:59
school is strange
260:01
you don't
260:02
what i don't feel like i what i don't
260:05
feel like i a belong b make c empty d
260:09
slip
260:10
so if you think some place is strange or
260:11
a group of people is strange you don't
260:13
fit in
260:14
right you don't
260:16
belong i don't feel like i belong maybe
260:20
you do belong but you don't feel like i
260:22
belong that's too bad you have to make
260:24
some friends if you make friends you get
260:26
used to the people there you find out oh
260:28
they're good people then you feel like
260:30
you belong in a place right but if you
260:33
feel strange
260:34
about the people you're with you don't
260:36
feel like you have anything in common
260:38
it's hard to talk to them then you feel
260:40
like you don't belong okay not make not
260:43
empty not slip those don't make sense
260:45
the best one is belong
260:47
seven south america has a really
260:50
interesting what immigration bee culture
260:53
c famine or d hat well famine is not
260:56
interesting it's terrible it's horrible
260:58
so that doesn't work right it has has a
261:01
really interesting hat just one
261:04
south america has an interesting hat
261:05
it's a really big hat that puts on the
261:07
whole continent now that's crazy right
261:09
has an interesting immigration we don't
261:12
think of immigration as being
261:13
interesting we think of immigration as
261:15
being a pain in the butt right it's very
261:18
difficult right so the only one south
261:21
america has a really interesting culture
261:23
that would fit because the beliefs and
261:25
the customs in south america are very
261:28
interesting but by the way south america
261:30
has many different countries in south
261:32
america and of course there are
261:34
different cultures in each of those
261:35
different countries and maybe even
261:37
inside those countries there might be
261:39
different cultures inside the country so
261:41
south america has really interesting
261:43
cultures would be more accurate right
261:47
but you could if you're talking about
261:49
although the culture or the the same
261:51
beliefs and behaviors that all people
261:54
from south america seem to generally
261:56
show then that could be possible too but
261:59
it'd be more accurate to say there are
262:00
many different cultures in south america
262:02
and those cultures are interesting
262:05
okay that wraps up the vocabulary
262:06
section of this lesson let's take a
262:09
short break we'll come back and look at
262:11
the reading
262:29
[Music]
262:39
hello everybody welcome back to reading
262:42
for vocabulary we're on unit 5 we're
262:45
talking about
262:47
cycles not your bicycle but something
262:50
that repeats like a circle like the
262:52
wheels on your bicycle they go around
262:55
and around and they begin again and
262:58
again so that's what we're talking about
263:00
with cycles in lesson 13 we're talking
263:04
about the world's greatest traveler now
263:08
you're probably thinking the world's
263:10
greatest traveler is it marco polo no
263:13
it's not a person it's a thing we're
263:16
going to focus on the cycle of water and
263:20
we're going to see how
263:22
water
263:23
is the world's greatest traveler because
263:26
water really travels a lot and it
263:29
travels in a cycle it goes around and
263:33
around well we'll explore that idea
263:36
later on in the reading passage but of
263:38
course as usual we need to learn some
263:41
vocabulary first to better understand
263:44
the reading passage so let's get started
263:47
with the vocabulary
263:48
the first word is
263:51
defined as a series of events that is
263:55
repeated a number of times now you've
263:58
probably seen these types of pictures
264:01
before we can see a tree in different
264:04
stages and we know
264:07
right that this is spring this is summer
264:10
this is fall and this is winter and we
264:13
might think well seasons but we're
264:16
saying a series of events
264:19
that is repeated a number of times it's
264:22
not just the seasons the seasons is an
264:25
example of this but what are we talking
264:28
about we're talking about a cycle it's
264:31
like i talked about before right on your
264:33
bicycle right you have two wheels well
264:36
think about one wheel it starts here and
264:38
it goes around and it comes back to the
264:41
beginning right it's a cycle it's a
264:44
series of events that is repeated so it
264:47
goes around right it starts here maybe
264:50
in spring
264:51
goes round to summer
264:54
then to fall then to winter and it comes
264:57
back to spring so the seasons is a type
265:00
of cycle and there are many types of
265:03
cycles in the world around us we'll talk
265:06
about one in the reading passage
265:09
okay word number two
265:11
water that falls from the sky
265:14
so you're probably thinking about rain
265:16
right you know this word rain that's an
265:20
easy word but there's another word that
265:23
we use for rain that's longer it's more
265:26
of a scientific word and i'm sorry it's
265:29
kind of long right
265:31
pre-si
265:39
wow so many syllables there's five
265:42
syllables so let's say it fast
265:45
wolf slow first and then fast
265:48
precipitation
265:50
precipitation
265:52
one more time
265:54
precipitation
265:55
okay so if you say it quickly it sounds
265:57
like
265:58
precipitation okay precipitation just
266:02
means rain it's more of a scientific
266:04
word for rain
266:06
okay let's move on to number three the
266:09
process of water collecting together in
266:12
the air so the process of water
266:15
collecting together in the air now
266:17
you're probably thinking what is this
266:19
it's a cloud but we're not talking about
266:23
a cloud we're not talking about uh the
266:26
grouping of moisture in the air we're
266:28
talking about the process of and there's
266:30
a special word for that we call that
266:33
condensation
266:35
oh big words in this lesson right so
266:38
let's do this slowly
266:42
shun
266:43
condensation
266:45
faster
266:47
condensation
266:48
condensation okay so condensation is a
266:52
process it's the process of water
266:55
collecting together in the air and
266:58
clouds are formed
267:01
because of
267:02
condensation so if you think how do
267:05
clouds appear in the sky it's because of
267:10
condensation so condensation is the
267:12
process okay let's move on
267:15
for a liquid to be taken into the air
267:18
this is a sad picture right this little
267:20
boy he wants to go swimming but there's
267:23
no water in the swimming pool
267:25
what happened to the water in the
267:27
swimming pool well
267:29
it
267:31
evaporated right evaporate is a verb
267:35
it's also a process right it's the
267:37
process of a liquid to be taken into the
267:41
air on a hot day
267:43
if you have a a dish of water or there's
267:46
a puddle of water on the ground well
267:49
after some time in the hot day that
267:52
water will disappear right in the
267:55
summertime you look at the streets
267:56
they're very dry a truck comes by and
267:59
sprays water on the streets but after a
268:02
little while the water is gone the
268:04
street is very dry again because of
268:09
evaporation okay so evaporation makes
268:12
the water go into the air and then when
268:15
the air is cooled the air the water gets
268:17
together and condensation
268:20
happens okay so first evaporation then
268:23
condensation we'll talk about those
268:24
later but we need to know about those
268:26
words okay next one
268:30
five to suck up or drink in
268:33
to suck up or drink in
268:35
is to absorb
268:38
absorb okay we're doing some a little
268:40
bit difficult less words in this lesson
268:43
right now of course if you spill
268:45
something you can use a paper towel to
268:49
absorb
268:51
the liquid that you spilled on the table
268:54
okay so you can use a paper towel and
268:58
paper towels the companies that make
269:01
paper towels will boast they will brag
269:04
they'll say our paper towels have great
269:07
absorption power right they will absorb
269:11
a lot of liquid to take in or to to suck
269:14
up or to drink in or to take in okay
269:19
oh he's happy to become aware to become
269:22
aware of something is to realize it
269:26
looks like he had oh i have an idea
269:28
right it's like bing a light bulb goes
269:30
on over his head he realizes something
269:34
he became aware of something a lot of
269:37
famous inventors are scientists you know
269:40
there's stories about them you know uh
269:42
coming to a moment of realization right
269:45
like the famous uh greek uh
269:48
philosopher who sat in a bathtub and
269:50
said oh eureka right and realized he
269:53
could use uh the water the weight of an
269:56
object in a water to realize how much
269:58
volume it had okay so to realize it's
270:02
like the moment you understand something
270:06
next one for a liquid to move together
270:09
in a single direction for a liquid any
270:12
liquid to move together and a lot of
270:14
liquid moving togetherness in one
270:16
direction it doesn't have to be a lot it
270:18
could be a cup of water but if you spill
270:20
it it moves in a direction
270:23
this stream of course is moving in a
270:25
direction downhill what is it doing it
270:28
is
270:28
flowing flow is a verb to flow so this
270:34
small stream is flowing
270:38
quickly right because maybe it's a it's
270:40
kind of a not very steep but it's it's a
270:44
it's not flat it's uh you know there's
270:46
uphill and then downhill and the water
270:48
will flow quickly downhill so this is a
270:51
very active stream right okay
270:55
next one greatly needed or necessary
270:58
greatly needed or necessary is
271:02
essential if something is essential you
271:05
really need it
271:07
you
271:08
for example we think of uh when we think
271:10
of essential it's like things that we
271:13
need to continue to survive like food
271:16
food is essential
271:18
air oxygen is essential if we don't have
271:21
it we'll die right so we greatly need it
271:24
it's very necessary it's essential okay
271:29
next one nine whoa
271:31
looks like uh he's on vacation at a
271:34
resort
271:36
a large cloth used for drying so what do
271:39
we call this cloth you probably take it
271:41
to the beach with you or you take it
271:44
when you go swimming you use it when you
271:46
take a shower or a bath it's called a
271:49
towel a towel so
271:52
if you're in an english-speaking country
271:55
and you want a cloth to dry yourself off
271:58
you can ask
272:00
is there a towel please or can i get a
272:03
towel okay next one
272:06
a flow of water used to clean oneself i
272:09
just mentioned this word after you do
272:12
this you need a towel remember what i
272:14
said i said when you take a shower when
272:17
we use the word shower we use it in a
272:20
larger expression very commonly take a
272:25
take a shower we also use take a bath
272:30
okay now what's the difference between a
272:33
shower and a bath well you see this boy
272:36
here the water is falling
272:38
from the faucet above it's falling on
272:41
him like rain that's a shower but a bath
272:45
is where you have a bathtub and you sit
272:48
in the water right and the water's
272:50
already there and you clean yourself
272:52
with the bath water it's kind of like
272:53
when you go to a sauna right it's kind
272:55
of like a big bath right and you get the
272:58
sauna but a shower is like this style so
273:02
but we use take up take a shower take a
273:05
bath okay you should take a shower every
273:08
day
273:09
you should take a shower after you
273:11
exercise remember to do that right if
273:14
you don't take a shower oh some nim say
273:16
is sale right okay next one
273:19
11 a collection of water high up in the
273:22
sky we talked about this before right i
273:25
gave you the word before it's a cloud
273:27
right so this airplane is flying over
273:31
these clouds
273:32
it's very beautiful if you're ever in an
273:34
airplane very high up in the sky look
273:37
out the window and you can see the the
273:40
clouds below you
273:42
it looks like land but it's very
273:44
fantastic right very beautiful very
273:47
white and looks very clean
273:49
okay next one
273:51
not moving so this lake the water in
273:55
this lake
273:57
is what it is very still
274:00
still we can also say
274:02
calm
274:04
still or calm
274:06
calm means there's no emotion right this
274:09
is very peaceful
274:11
calm
274:12
the water is still no movement okay
274:16
that's a very beautiful picture
274:19
next one a very tiny bit of water so a
274:21
very tiny bit of water
274:24
what do we call that we call it a
274:26
droplet a droplet it's like a little
274:29
ball of water right when we
274:31
when we just drop a little bit of water
274:33
on something or when it rains just
274:35
lightly not a lot but the water will
274:38
collect in little drops in drops and we
274:41
call them droplets there's one droplet
274:44
two droplets you could also of course
274:46
just say a drop of water but sometimes
274:50
people will say droplet
274:52
okay next one
274:54
a small pool of water is a puddle so you
274:57
like to go splashing through the puddles
274:59
right okay this girl of course she's
275:02
wearing good shoes for that don't do
275:04
that if you're wearing shoes and socks
275:05
your mother will be angry right but if
275:08
you're wearing sandals or
275:10
rubber shoes like she's wearing no
275:12
problem have fun right go running
275:15
through the puddles of water kids like
275:17
to do that
275:18
okay next one icy rain it's rain
275:22
but it's really cold so it becomes icy
275:26
it's almost freezing we call that sleet
275:30
so sleet is you know it's not snow it's
275:33
not rain but it's like
275:35
almost
275:37
a combination of both it's where it's
275:40
really cold and it's raining and it's
275:42
it's almost icy right so it's icy rain
275:45
it's sleet now sleet is dangerous
275:48
because on the roads we have to be very
275:50
careful because as you know ice is
275:54
right it's slippery right so you have to
275:57
be careful when it's sleet outside you
275:59
also have to be careful when you're
276:01
walking
276:02
okay next one for a liquid to absorb
276:06
into something when a liquid absorb we
276:08
heard this word before right we talked
276:11
about the paper towel right the paper
276:13
towel will clean up the liquid it will
276:16
absorb into the paper towel we say it's
276:19
soaked right if you are soaked right
276:23
it's raining really hard like in the
276:25
summertime you go outside and you don't
276:28
have an umbrella you don't have a
276:30
raincoat you're just wearing normal
276:32
clothes what happens
276:34
you get water everywhere in your hair on
276:37
your shirt under your shirt on your
276:39
underwear is completely wet your socks
276:42
in your shoes
276:44
when you're walking right it makes a
276:46
noise you are soaked right so people
276:50
will say i
276:52
am
276:53
soaked
276:55
it means
276:56
i got water
276:57
everywhere right i have to take
276:59
everything off take a hot shower and
277:02
then dry off because i'm soaked okay so
277:05
to soak is for liquid to completely
277:08
absorb into something it doesn't matter
277:10
what it is it could be you your skin
277:13
right it could be a paper towel it could
277:16
be a dog you know whatever the water has
277:19
completely gotten in and onto something
277:22
that's to soak
277:24
okay next one
277:25
well not next one we need to look at the
277:27
words let's check the words that we just
277:30
learned make sure that we remember those
277:32
and how they are used so let's go over
277:34
the different problems here number one i
277:37
just beep that i forgot to do my
277:39
homework so
277:41
you just
277:43
what it's like you have an idea
277:46
and what is that i just a made b
277:49
realized
277:50
c spent
277:52
d
277:52
absorbed
277:54
so in this case right
277:57
we could use a word that means that you
278:00
had a sudden idea you suddenly became
278:04
aware of the fact that you forgot to do
278:08
your homework has that ever happened to
278:09
you it's not a good feeling oh my gosh
278:12
right it's at the beginning of the
278:14
lesson the beginning of the class
278:16
and you're suddenly realized oh my gosh
278:19
there was homework yesterday the teacher
278:21
gave us homework and i forgot suddenly
278:24
you have that idea that means you
278:27
realized i just realized oh i just
278:30
thought i just remembered i just
278:33
realized that i forgot to do my homework
278:35
not made not spent not absorbed those
278:38
don't make sense realized you suddenly
278:40
became aware of that fact
278:43
okay number four
278:45
birth and death are part of the beep of
278:48
life think about that
278:50
birth is at the beginning
278:52
right a person lives their life right
278:54
and then they die
278:56
now
278:57
of course for an individual person for
278:59
one person it's not
279:01
a continual process but if that person
279:04
is born they grow up they have a baby
279:07
right that person is born and they grow
279:09
so it's like it goes around in a circle
279:12
right so what do we call that birth and
279:14
death are part of the what of life end
279:17
beginning c cycle d loss
279:20
remember we have a beginning and then an
279:23
end and then it starts again right well
279:25
life continues right not for the
279:27
individual person unfortunately right uh
279:31
it's like a straight line birth and then
279:33
death but if we're talking about all
279:35
things like human beings right people
279:38
are born they die more people are born
279:41
they die it goes around in a continual
279:43
process so we call that what we call it
279:46
a cycle that's what i talked about
279:48
before right birth and death are part of
279:51
the cycle of life
279:53
okay if you watch the lion king maybe an
279:56
older movie maybe you haven't seen it
279:57
but at the beginning they talk about the
280:00
circle of life that's the same idea it's
280:02
the cycle of life they're talking about
280:05
constant death and constant renewal
280:08
constant death and constant birth it
280:10
goes in a cycle the circle of life
280:12
there's a song
280:13
associated with that okay but it's not
280:16
the end of life because birth continues
280:19
it's not the beginning because that's
280:20
only one part and it's not the loss of
280:22
life it's the cycle it goes again and
280:25
again
280:27
okay next one number five
280:29
when there is enough water in the sky it
280:32
will beep to form clouds now remember
280:35
before i talked about this how are
280:38
clouds formed what is the process
280:42
for forming clouds why are clouds formed
280:45
because it precipitates because it rains
280:48
no because it flows
280:50
right it will flow to form
280:53
uh clouds water will flow in the sky
280:55
that's weird that doesn't make sense it
280:57
will realize
280:59
water can't think right it will condense
281:02
ah condense
281:04
to form clouds
281:06
condensation is the reason that clouds
281:09
are formed if there's enough water in
281:11
the sky that water will gather together
281:14
and form clouds and we call that
281:17
the process we call it to condense right
281:20
and we call it condensation
281:22
okay
281:23
seven here this tissue will beep the
281:26
blood so if you're bleeding oh no you
281:28
have to absorb the blood right i just
281:31
gave you the answer right this tissue
281:33
will absorb the blood you need to
281:36
not drink it in but you need to
281:38
soak it in you need to stop that blood
281:40
so you use a tissue or maybe a bandage
281:43
to stop the blood it will absorb the
281:45
blood and then stop the bleeding
281:48
absorb not flow not cut not pinch but to
281:51
absorb the blood
281:53
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
281:55
section of our lesson today let's take a
281:57
short break come back and we'll do the
281:59
reading together so don't go away
282:19
[Music]
282:29
hello everybody welcome back to reading
282:31
for vocabulary i'm your host brian
282:33
stewart we're going over cycles still
282:36
we're still talking about cycles as you
282:38
remember cycles are things that don't
282:40
really start anywhere or finish anywhere
282:42
they just kind of go and they repeat
282:45
again and again
282:46
but what we're talking about in lesson
282:48
14 is what a farmer knows and we're
282:52
focusing on smart
282:54
farming methods
282:56
so farmers think about cycles
282:59
when they work they have to know about
283:01
cycles
283:03
in order to
283:04
grow the correct food for us of course
283:08
we need to eat and farmers
283:10
need to grow the food that we get at the
283:12
supermarket right so what do farmers
283:15
know about cycles how do they use their
283:17
knowledge to help them in their jobs
283:20
that's what we'll read about in this
283:22
lesson but again before we read before
283:25
we do the reading section we need to go
283:27
over a vocabulary a vocabulary list to
283:30
make sure we understand the reading
283:32
section well let's go so the first one
283:35
number one
283:37
of course we can see a farmer here with
283:39
some of his products right
283:41
now when we talk about the farmers
283:43
products we say the crop that is
283:45
gathered at the end of a season the crop
283:48
crop of course means the type of food
283:51
that the farmer's growing
283:53
when they gather at the end of a season
283:56
we call it
283:58
the harvest right so this is a noun
284:02
and we say that it is all of the food
284:05
that the farmer grows at the end of the
284:08
season now we can talk about the harvest
284:10
for one farmer but usually we talk about
284:13
the harvest and we mean all farmers for
284:15
a region or a nation
284:17
so if we say the harvest was very good
284:20
this year we're usually talking about
284:23
all farmers in our region the harvest
284:26
was very good this year so there's a lot
284:28
of food in the supermarkets maybe prices
284:31
are low
284:32
but of course we can also talk about
284:33
individual one individual farmer has a
284:36
bad harvest and another farmer has a
284:38
good harvest so bad harvest good harvest
284:42
it's the amount of food that they
284:44
collect
284:45
at the end of the growing season okay
284:48
next one number two to put seeds in a
284:51
field to grow well what do farmers do
284:54
they put the seeds into the ground in
284:57
the field to grow they don't do it by
284:59
hand
285:01
so much these days they usually use
285:02
machines but what do they call that they
285:05
call it to sow
285:06
to sow
285:08
and it's interesting uh there's a an
285:10
expression i think it comes from the
285:12
bible uh you
285:15
reap
285:17
what
285:19
you
285:21
sow
285:22
you reap what you sow reap means to
285:24
harvest to gather at the end you get it
285:27
but think about it
285:28
whatever you put in the ground that's
285:30
what you're going to get but not just
285:32
planting
285:34
seeds in the ground
285:35
if you lie
285:36
you're going to get a lot of problems
285:39
so if you
285:41
sow problems if you lie if you do bad
285:45
actions what will you get from those
285:47
you'll get bad results you reap what you
285:50
sow but if you do good actions and you
285:52
tell the truth and you're good to your
285:54
friends
285:55
then you will get a lot of appreciation
285:58
and good things back from your friends
286:00
so that's a good expression to remember
286:02
and it uses the word so
286:04
it comes from to put fields to put seeds
286:06
in the field to grow but also in our
286:09
life we're also sowing our life right
286:12
we're our actions are sowing uh the
286:14
results that we'll get later on so you
286:16
reap what you sow so is an irregular
286:18
verb we say so sowed sown
286:22
sowed sod so sod sown so we don't
286:26
normally use this word in our everyday
286:28
speech because we're not farmers but
286:30
sometimes we see expressions that do use
286:33
this word okay next one
286:36
to reach full growth to reach full
286:38
growth is
286:40
to mature
286:41
and we need of course when we're talking
286:43
about plants and crops like corn
286:46
tomatoes apples pears we don't pick
286:50
these things when they're young when
286:52
they're not mature we have to wait till
286:55
they are fully grown
286:56
then we pick them and eat them
286:59
if you pick the tomato before it's
287:01
mature
287:02
it's too small and it's green and oh it
287:04
tastes horrible right but if you wait
287:07
till it's mature and then you eat it
287:09
then it tastes good and it's larger okay
287:14
a plant grown by farmers so any plant
287:17
grown by farmers we already use this
287:20
word in the fir
287:21
in explaining the first word it's crop
287:24
so any plant grown by farmers is a crop
287:28
usually crops or things we eat for
287:30
example potatoes tomatoes
287:34
celery looks like they have here
287:36
squash
287:38
those are crops but it's not just food
287:41
because sometimes farmers will grow
287:42
things that we don't eat but that are
287:44
used in other uh purp for other purposes
287:48
okay
287:50
for example like barley that's used to
287:52
make a beer right well some people will
287:54
make food from barley too but farmers
287:56
don't just grow food they grow many
287:58
different types of plants that are not
288:00
just used for fruit food but any plant
288:03
that is grown by farmers is we call it a
288:06
crop
288:07
okay next one
288:09
a substance that keeps living beings
288:12
healthy and a lot of things we can see
288:14
the different listing it's a list of
288:17
what
288:18
nutrients right and we have this word
288:20
here nutrition facts they're very
288:23
similar nutrition has to do with the
288:26
things that we have to eat every day to
288:29
keep us healthy and those individual
288:31
things are nutrients you should choose
288:35
foods that have good nutrients and a lot
288:38
of nutrients in them usually junk food
288:42
like hamburgers and french fries
288:44
don't have a lot of nutrients right
288:47
healthy food has many nutrients these
288:50
are substances that keep us healthy
288:54
next one
288:55
to prepare the land for growing crops
288:58
farming is hard work right uh this
289:01
especially using this in a garden in
289:03
somebody's garden you have to what do
289:06
you have to do to the soil you have to
289:08
cultivate
289:09
you have to prepare the land for growing
289:13
crops now on a big farm they have big
289:15
machines that will
289:18
turn up the land that will cultivate the
289:20
field and then it's ready so that they
289:23
can put the seeds down they can sow the
289:25
land then
289:26
but this is what we call cultivate
289:29
cultivate isn't just for farming we can
289:32
also use it for other ideas for example
289:34
when you study you are cultivating your
289:37
mind you're preparing your mind for
289:41
later on in life right when you study
289:43
different subjects so you can cultivate
289:46
your mind parents can cultivate their
289:48
children it just means that you're
289:50
preparing them for something else when
289:52
you cultivate the land for growing crops
289:55
you are cultivating
289:56
okay next one
289:58
good for growing having plenty of
290:01
nutrients so if the land is good for
290:04
growing you can grow a lot of good uh
290:07
crops there and the land has a lot of
290:10
nutrients in the soil we say that the
290:12
land is
290:14
fertile
290:15
fertile
290:16
and if the land is not fertile we say
290:19
it's in fertile
290:21
in means not so if you think of the
290:24
desert can you grow plants in the desert
290:28
no you can't because the desert is
290:30
infertile there's not enough nutrients
290:32
in the soil of course there's not enough
290:34
water
290:35
okay but if you see good rich earth and
290:38
you pick it up and it's black or it's
290:40
very dark brown or black earth that's
290:44
fertile soil it's good it has a lot of
290:46
nutrients in it it's good for growing
290:48
crops it's fertile
290:50
okay next one
290:52
eight to use again and of course we know
290:55
this symbol here we see this in many
290:57
places these days but of course this is
290:59
what you should do with your garbage if
291:01
you're finished with a plastic bottle
291:03
what should you do you should use it
291:05
again you should re-cycle
291:08
re
291:09
means again right and cycle we know that
291:12
work right it goes in a cycle so we
291:15
recycle we use it again and again
291:18
and this is what we should do with our
291:19
garbage right plastic here paper here
291:22
metal here other garbage in another
291:25
place recycle your garbage then we can
291:28
use it again
291:30
number nine
291:32
and animal waste animal waste
291:34
we think about animal waste in a
291:36
previous lesson we talked about this
291:38
right about training your dog remember
291:40
you may remember what do pets do dogs go
291:43
poo and pee
291:44
poo
291:45
and pee
291:47
of course
291:52
okay and p of course is the water
291:55
this is animal waste now it's
291:58
interesting because farmers use animal
292:00
waste they use it to feed plants
292:04
did you know that right if your dog goes
292:07
poo poo next to a tree that's good for
292:10
the tree because the tree uses that as
292:14
there are nutrients in the poop of
292:16
course it's very disgusting we shouldn't
292:18
you know you know don't touch it don't
292:20
get near it but
292:22
plants like it right because that's
292:24
their food okay so animal waste and
292:27
remember we are animals too so it can be
292:30
human waste not just your dog
292:32
animal waste that is used to feed plants
292:34
we have a special word for it we don't
292:36
call it or pea or dung we call it
292:39
manure
292:40
manure
292:42
and it's usually like cow manure or
292:45
horse manure it could be other types of
292:47
animals but usually it's cow manure
292:49
because farmers have cows a lot of cows
292:52
and what are they doing they're pooing a
292:53
lot so they use that
292:56
for manure and in fact that's an
292:58
industry some companies make manure
293:01
that's their job they take the animal
293:03
waste and they make it into manure that
293:06
looks like this and they sell it to
293:08
farmers and so they transfer it so
293:10
that's an industry that's a company
293:12
right it's very interesting business
293:14
okay next one
293:16
ten having a bad smell before i said poo
293:19
is nem se na payo right we say stinky
293:23
you can also say stinky oh your feet are
293:26
stinky oh and i'm saying
293:27
right you say your feet are stinky or
293:31
somebody's breath
293:32
it's stinky or somebody's you know
293:35
underarm stinky
293:37
okay stinky next one
293:40
11 to take away not shoes but to take
293:43
away means to
293:44
to drain so imagine this poor guy here
293:48
his energy is drained it's like a
293:51
battery right your cell phone battery uh
293:54
the battery
293:55
is gone you take away the battery power
293:58
by using your cell phone you drain the
294:01
battery
294:02
some people's people it's like they have
294:04
a battery their body they lose all their
294:06
energy they feel drained i feel drained
294:10
that's some some people can say that
294:12
that means i have no energy it's all
294:14
gone
294:16
next one acting in a smart and sensible
294:19
way so someone acts in a smart and
294:21
sensible what is this girl doing she's
294:23
she's pushing away the hamburger and the
294:26
coke and instead of eating the hamburger
294:29
she's eating an apple this is sensible
294:32
so she is wise
294:34
wise is like smart but wise also means
294:38
you have a lot of experience you're
294:40
acting on experience smart smart kind of
294:43
means you're intelligent you maybe you
294:45
know about how to solve math problems or
294:47
you know how to do that but wise is more
294:50
like life experience if you know how to
294:53
act in a sensible or practical way
294:56
because of your life experience you are
294:59
wise and that's usually why older people
295:02
are wise because they have more
295:04
experience in life there's a little
295:06
difference between wise and smart right
295:10
wise is usually because of past
295:12
experiences you act in a sensible way
295:16
okay next one
295:18
a big open space filled with plants so
295:21
of course this is famous is this gordian
295:23
is it right uh do you have the tea um
295:26
the the the plants that they make tea
295:29
from green tea korea is famous for tea
295:31
and there's a place in in korea that is
295:34
very famous for growing tea it looks
295:35
like this is a picture from that area or
295:37
an area similar to that but it doesn't
295:39
matter if it's tea it could be corn it
295:42
could be wheat it's a big open space
295:44
filled with plants we call it
295:46
a field okay farmers need
295:49
usually it's usually flat of course if
295:51
it's on a hill or a mountain it's not a
295:53
field really it should be flat and
295:56
farmers need wide open fields to grow
296:00
their crops field okay 14 absolutely
296:03
necessary so what is it it's a seat belt
296:07
absolutely necessary it's crucial
296:10
now a seat belt some people may argue
296:12
well seat belt's not absolutely
296:14
necessary right a lot of times i don't
296:16
get in an accident but nowadays because
296:19
of safety and because of the traffic
296:20
laws
296:21
we think seat belts are absolutely
296:24
necessary they're crucial they're very
296:26
important because if you do get in an
296:29
accident they are absolutely necessary
296:31
to make sure that you are not injured or
296:33
killed so they are crucial crucial
296:36
something that's needed very much
296:39
next one okay i was talking about poop
296:41
before right clean up after your dog
296:45
means scoop up the poop right
296:48
now this definition though unused food
296:51
that the body gets rid of right unused
296:54
food when you eat something your body
296:57
uses most of the food but some of the
296:59
food it doesn't use and that food passes
297:01
through your body what do we call it we
297:04
call it waste
297:06
okay now before you may have encountered
297:08
ways to sometimes people refer to
297:11
garbage as waste and that's possible
297:14
right especially for like a big
297:15
factories or big businesses have a lot
297:18
of waste it's like extra
297:20
stuff that they don't need we call that
297:22
waste but it we also call
297:24
the organic the food the edible
297:28
material that passes through our body
297:30
and we get rid of when we go to the
297:32
bathroom we call that waste
297:34
okay
297:36
okay next word last word is facts and
297:39
ideas that are known facts and ideas
297:41
that we know those are knowledge so
297:45
think about that
297:47
human beings are
297:49
getting more and more facts and more and
297:52
more ideas
297:54
every year every 10 years every 100
297:56
years the amount of
297:58
knowledge of that human beings have
298:02
gathered together especially over the
298:04
past several hundred years has grown
298:06
by a lot so we talk about that knowledge
298:10
as
298:11
we talk about those ideas and those
298:12
facts as knowledge so facts and ideas
298:15
that we know about that's knowledge
298:17
there's many things we don't know about
298:19
but
298:20
human beings are very curious we keep
298:22
learning about our environment and so
298:24
our
298:26
our area or our degree of knowledge
298:28
keeps growing
298:30
okay well those are the words let's do
298:32
the exercises see how well we remember
298:35
those words okay number one we need to
298:38
beep the field before we spread the
298:41
seeds so before you spread the seeds and
298:43
put them in the ground what do you need
298:45
to do you need to prepare the field is
298:48
that pull cultivate sow or cover
298:52
remember so
298:53
is spread the seeds
298:55
so we need to do something before we sow
298:58
the field we need to
299:00
cultivate the field remember cultivate
299:04
means to prepare to prepare something we
299:07
need to prepare the field before we
299:09
spread the seeds we need to cultivate
299:11
the field before we spread the seeds
299:13
okay number three
299:15
we've cultivated there's that word again
299:17
we've cultivated that field with plenty
299:20
of manure
299:22
it is very beep okay
299:24
so again part of cultivating part of
299:26
preparing the land is you know like
299:28
turning uh you know making a rose in it
299:31
or or breaking up the top surface so the
299:34
seeds can get in the land easily but
299:36
another part of cultivating is putting
299:38
manure on the ground right so when you
299:42
put manure on the ground remember manure
299:44
has a lot of nutrients in it that's good
299:46
for the plants and when we say a plant
299:49
an area is good or has a lot of
299:51
nutrients it's good for growing we say
299:54
that land is fertile fertile
299:57
we've cultivated that field with plenty
299:59
of manure it is very fertile or fertile
300:02
some people pronounce it different ways
300:04
fertile
300:05
so not useless not marked not understood
300:08
but fertile okay next one
300:11
five you should beep that bottle you can
300:14
fill it back up with water fill it back
300:17
up
300:18
so
300:18
you have a bottle right a plastic bottle
300:21
of water okay uh i'm not going to throw
300:24
it away i'm going to use it again i'm
300:26
going to fill it back up with water
300:27
because why should i throw it away right
300:29
still good right
300:31
so what should i do i should use it
300:33
again what word means to use again a
300:35
recycle b harvest c believe or d crack
300:39
of course you know a means to use again
300:42
you should recycle that bottle you
300:45
should use it again because you can fill
300:47
it up with water again don't throw it
300:49
away use it again
300:51
seven that plant is not healthy not
300:54
healthy it needs more what what do
300:57
plants need to grow well what did i talk
300:59
about before what do plants need to keep
301:02
their bodies strong and healthy not just
301:04
plants but also animals
301:06
nutrients
301:08
crops
301:09
fields or knowledge okay now we're
301:12
talking about healthy right not smart
301:14
besides plants can't think they don't
301:16
have brains so right away we know
301:18
knowledge is not the answer
301:20
crops no because that's a type of
301:23
food that farmers grow fields it needs
301:25
more fields that doesn't make sense it
301:28
needs of course more nutrients nutrients
301:31
are what living things need to stay
301:33
healthy so that's the answer
301:36
okay well that wraps it up for the
301:37
vocabulary section let's take a short
301:39
break and we'll come back and look at
301:41
the reading together
302:01
[Music]
302:10
hello everybody welcome back to reading
302:13
for vocabulary we're on our last lesson
302:16
of the book i hope you enjoyed studying
302:18
with me but we have one more lesson to
302:21
go so we have some more something more
302:23
interesting to go over before we finish
302:26
with the book and of course we're still
302:28
talking about the topic of cycles right
302:31
things that go around that continue and
302:33
continue they don't really have a
302:35
beginning or end they just continue to
302:38
go
302:39
this lesson lesson 15 we're talking
302:41
about as the earth moves so now we're
302:44
talking about the cycle of the earth's
302:47
motion as you know you should know the
302:50
earth moves around the sun that's a
302:53
cycle but we'll talk about some other
302:56
cycles too that you may not know about
302:59
concerning the earth's motion so that's
303:02
what we're going to read about we're
303:03
going to focus on earth's motion and
303:07
weather so we're not just talking about
303:09
the motion of the earth but we're also
303:12
talking about how does that affect
303:15
the weather how does that change the
303:18
weather on earth right when the earth is
303:21
moving through space
303:23
what effect how does that change the
303:26
weather on earth so it'll be an
303:28
interesting lesson about that but of
303:30
course as usual let's study some
303:32
vocabulary so that we can understand the
303:35
reading passage more quickly when we get
303:38
to that okay the first
303:40
word on our word list is defined as to
303:44
understand well and i hope you've
303:46
understood my lessons well what is
303:49
another word to understand well it's to
303:52
comprehend it's a big word right
303:56
comprehend only three sounds so not so
303:59
bad
304:00
comprehend
304:01
comprehend means that you understand
304:04
well so like i said i hope that you
304:06
comprehend my lessons with you well i
304:10
hope that you can comprehend and i hope
304:12
that i explain things well enough okay
304:14
good so number two
304:16
to make bear when you make something
304:18
bare like
304:20
when i get a haircut right
304:22
i expose
304:24
my head if i get a really short haircut
304:27
so you can see my skin then i've exposed
304:30
my head right to expose something to
304:33
make bear if i roll up my sleeves you
304:36
can see the skin on my arms i have
304:39
exposed my arms right i'm not going to
304:42
do it it takes too long but you get the
304:44
idea right you take off a hat you've
304:47
exposed your head to the sky outside
304:50
okay so to expose to make bear next one
304:54
half of a sphere now a sphere what is a
304:57
sphere
304:58
a sphere is a round shape but not just
305:02
two dimension
305:03
three dimensional that's a sphere so if
305:06
we look at the earth right the earth is
305:09
a
305:10
three-dimensional circle right it's a
305:12
sphere a circle is only two dimensions
305:16
right a circle is just
305:18
two dimensions but a sphere is three
305:21
dimensions we can see the shape in 3d
305:26
okay so half of the spirit well now
305:27
we're talking about half
305:29
half of a sphere so if we talk about
305:32
half of the world usually we talk about
305:34
like the northern half or the southern
305:37
half and when we do that we use a
305:39
special word and that word is hemi
305:42
sphere
305:44
hemi now think of this word it's one
305:47
word but think of it in two sections
305:50
first we have hemi
305:52
and then we have sphere of course you
305:54
know a lot of english words are
305:56
shorter words or smaller words that are
305:59
joined together in this case hemi is a
306:02
greek
306:04
word it's it has its origins in the
306:06
greek language as many words do have
306:09
origins in greek or latin right in this
306:12
case hemi is a greek prefix
306:15
hemi
306:16
means half
306:18
hemi is half so if we say hemi half a
306:21
sphere
306:23
we're talking about half of a sphere and
306:25
so we say the northern
306:28
hemisphere or the southern hemisphere
306:32
sometimes people will also say the
306:34
western hemisphere and the eastern
306:36
hemisphere saying that the west is uh
306:39
for example europe and america and the
306:42
east is asia
306:44
right sometimes people will say that
306:47
but usually you know it's it's hard to
306:48
say you know where where does it stop
306:50
and end but it's easy to know north and
306:52
south because there's the equator right
306:55
there's the equator right here that is a
306:58
good dividing line for north and south
307:02
so we can easily say northern hemisphere
307:04
and southern hemisphere okay next word
307:08
number four
307:09
maybe you've seen this picture before
307:11
it's not to scale right if it was to
307:14
scale it would be too big we couldn't
307:16
show it here
307:17
but this shows the sun and all the
307:19
planets
307:20
around the sun
307:23
and we see that the planets have these
307:26
lines these circles going around and we
307:28
see to move around an object in space
307:31
right this is space out here nothing's
307:33
really out there also we see a comet
307:36
over here that also moves around an
307:38
object in space all of these objects are
307:40
moving around the sun
307:43
we say they are orbiting around the sun
307:46
so
307:47
mercury venus earth mars they are all
307:50
orbiting around the sun they are moving
307:53
around the sun the comet is moving
307:56
around the sun now on a planet like
307:59
jupiter which has many little moons
308:02
those moons are orbiting around jupiter
308:05
our moon the moon that we see at night
308:09
orbits around earth okay so there are
308:12
many different orbits that we can see in
308:14
the night sky it just means an object a
308:17
big object is moving well not even a big
308:19
object could be a small object like when
308:21
astronauts go into space they go around
308:24
the earth they are orbiting the earth to
308:27
move around another object in a circle
308:30
or some type of circle
308:32
okay number five the very top or bottom
308:35
of the earth so here we're looking at
308:37
antarctica antarctica and on the other
308:40
side of course
308:41
there's no land right antarctica is a
308:44
land mass there's no land on the other
308:46
side but what we're talking about we're
308:47
talking about the very top or bottom of
308:50
the earth of course we're talking about
308:52
the poles and here we see the south pole
308:56
antarctica is at the south pole there's
308:59
no land at the north pole but there is
309:01
ice right and animals do live up there
309:04
like for example polar bears live on the
309:07
north pole santa claus has his house at
309:10
the north pole right okay so so these
309:13
are the poles south pole or north pole
309:17
number six
309:18
to be on top of so to be on top of
309:21
especially to um
309:23
be all over the top of not just sitting
309:26
on the top here but all over the top
309:29
means to cover
309:31
so this blanket is all over the top of
309:34
the car and it hides the car actually we
309:37
can't see the car we know it's a car
309:38
because we can see part of it right here
309:40
but
309:41
if we can't see it we see that the this
309:43
blanket or this sheet covers the car
309:47
okay so cover doesn't just mean to be on
309:49
top of something like for example
309:51
there's a dog here right i'm not a very
309:53
good artist but okay
309:55
anyway that's a that's my doggie
309:58
if the dog is sitting up there the dog
310:00
is not covering the car to cover means
310:02
to cover all the the entire surface of
310:06
something to to cover a large surface of
310:10
something that's to cover
310:12
seven
310:14
not circular shaped like an egg so this
310:17
looks like a mirror right okay but it's
310:19
not a circular a circle is more like
310:21
this now can i draw a circle i'm okay
310:23
that's not a very good circle i again
310:26
i'm not a very good artist but if you
310:28
can draw a perfect circle very quickly
310:30
perfect circle that's a circle but this
310:33
is not a circle this looks like an egg
310:36
so what do we call it we call it
310:38
elliptical elliptical now an easier word
310:42
of course is also oval an oval shape
310:46
this would be an oval shape but more
310:47
scientific word is elliptical
310:51
elliptical elliptical shape is like an
310:55
oval it's not a perfect circle
310:58
okay eight
311:00
a particular length of time
311:03
so a particular length of time you know
311:05
beginning and ending and we call that
311:07
you know that's a certain period of time
311:09
i just gave you the word period a period
311:12
of time is what we call a particular
311:14
length so an hour
311:16
is a period of time a minute is another
311:19
period of time a second is a period of
311:22
time so there's many different periods
311:24
of time it's just a particular length of
311:26
time we give it a name
311:29
okay number nine
311:31
now this girl has a decision to make
311:34
right she can go right or she can go
311:36
left so she's thinking of something what
311:39
is the verb that means to think of
311:40
something especially to to think about
311:43
it deeply is to consider she is
311:46
considering okay what's the fastest way
311:49
to get to the store should i go right or
311:51
should i go left okay so she's thinking
311:54
about it okay she's considering her
311:56
choices especially when we have a choice
311:59
to make we consider the good points and
312:02
the bad points about each choice and
312:04
then we make our decision so we consider
312:08
number 10
312:09
something that influences or has a part
312:13
in so something that influences or has a
312:16
part in we call that a factor now this
312:19
is more of a
312:20
maybe a scientific word right a factor
312:23
is like for example i just said we think
312:25
about the good points or bad points all
312:27
the good points that's a factor all the
312:30
negative or bad points those are also
312:32
factors we call those pros
312:36
and
312:36
cons right
312:39
pros are good points and cons are bad
312:42
points
312:43
these are all the factors that we use we
312:46
think of all these things when we
312:48
consider something so they're all the
312:50
things that influence our choice or has
312:54
a part in our choice or the result of
312:58
something those are factors
313:00
okay next one
313:03
uh oh somebody's in trouble right i
313:05
think the cat knocked over the uh the
313:07
potted plant and the dog is looking at
313:09
the cat saying you're in trouble you
313:11
know when master comes home okay
313:14
to be the cause of something is to be
313:17
responsible for
313:20
responsible so re
313:26
responsible
313:28
who is responsible for this mess
313:33
who is responsible for breaking the pot
313:38
i think it's the cat what do you think
313:39
who's responsible but sometimes you know
313:42
if something happens there's an accident
313:44
that happens people will ask who's
313:46
responsible they'll also ask another
313:49
word they'll use another word fault
313:51
right
313:52
fault and when you use fault you can say
313:56
it's
313:58
my
314:00
fault if you say it's my fault that
314:02
means i am responsible
314:05
i
314:06
am responsible i am responsible it's my
314:10
fault
314:11
whose fault is it
314:14
who is responsible it means the same
314:17
thing
314:18
okay
314:19
12. oh
314:20
kipchio maybe quiechio maybe a little
314:23
ugly but it's very cute right these two
314:26
dogs
314:27
in a very small way now what are we
314:29
talking about we're talking about
314:30
slightly
314:32
so these two dogs are slightly similar
314:36
i'm not really sure what we're going
314:38
we're doing with the picture here but
314:39
slightly in a very small way maybe
314:42
they're licking their lips slightly all
314:44
right just a little bit in a very small
314:46
way slightly if you do something but
314:49
it's not in a big way it's in a small
314:51
way you can say slightly give you
314:54
another example
314:55
it rains right sometimes it rains
314:57
heavily really coming down that's not
315:00
slightly it's not slightly raining it's
315:03
heavily raining but if it's raining and
315:05
just the little tiny drops are coming
315:07
down you could almost go outside without
315:10
an umbrella you won't get too wet it's
315:12
just raining slightly just choke them
315:16
right
315:18
right just a little bit of rain is
315:21
falling from the sky it's slightly
315:23
raining
315:24
okay next one
315:25
here it looks like a calendar monday
315:27
tuesday wednesday not long lasting if
315:31
something doesn't last a long time it
315:33
only lasts one two or three days it
315:36
doesn't last very long depending on what
315:38
it is right if we're sick for three days
315:41
we think it's a long time but really
315:43
it's just short term right it's done in
315:46
three days it's over in a day or three
315:48
days right
315:50
short term it doesn't last very long
315:53
what's the opposite of short term well
315:55
of course we would say
315:56
long term pandero right
315:59
long term is the opposite pandero of
316:02
short term so you can talk about
316:04
something that's short term you talk
316:06
about something that's long term okay
316:08
those are opposites
316:11
fourteen now somebody made a mistake
316:13
here right one plus one equals three
316:16
that's crazy
316:17
the word is uh defined as something that
316:20
is smart and logical we would say it's
316:23
it it sensible sense it makes sense now
316:27
usually when we use sense
316:29
in a sentence we don't say it's sense
316:31
don't say it's sense say
316:34
it
316:36
makes
316:38
sense you have to remember
316:41
use this word here it
316:43
makes sense don't just say it's it's
316:47
sense no
316:48
it makes sense now this doesn't make
316:51
sense this
316:53
doesn't
316:56
doesn't
316:57
it doesn't make and then we use s
317:00
because it doesn't it doesn't make sense
317:03
one plus one equals three that doesn't
317:06
make sense okay it's not smart it's not
317:10
logical okay so when we use the word
317:13
sense we use it to describe something
317:15
that's smart and logical that makes
317:17
sense that's logical well something is
317:20
not logical we say it doesn't make sense
317:25
okay
317:26
okay next one
317:28
for the entire year and of course this
317:30
looks like
317:32
i'm not sure but i think it's mount
317:34
everest in the himalayas and you think
317:36
about mount everest whenever you think
317:38
about mount everest you think of snow
317:41
and it doesn't matter what time of year
317:43
it is it could even be the summer time
317:45
there's still snow
317:47
in the mountains on this mountain
317:49
because the mountain's so high so for
317:51
the entire year
317:52
we say
317:53
year round there is snow
317:57
there is snow
317:59
year-round on mount everest that means
318:02
all year long there is snow on mount
318:05
everest it's year long
318:07
okay
318:08
last one according to science this guy
318:11
is very smart right he's he's doing some
318:14
kind of engineering diagram okay
318:17
technically if you he's doing something
318:20
and he's getting into you know according
318:24
very specifically how it's used
318:26
technically
318:28
uh you know you could say it's according
318:30
to a scientific method according to
318:32
science it's done in a very logical
318:36
or in a very detailed way and you're
318:38
breaking down all the different parts
318:41
how is each part going to work well
318:43
that's a technical drawing so they've
318:45
done it very technically now sometimes
318:48
people will use this word technically
318:50
right adverb to describe
318:53
something exact for example
318:56
a lot of things we say we just say
318:58
generally
318:59
and they may not be true right exactly
319:02
they might not be true in all cases so
319:04
in that case we say well
319:06
technically that's not true
319:09
technically
319:11
okay well that's that's not the common
319:13
case you know generally it's this way
319:15
but technically it might be a little
319:17
different okay so we'll see that later
319:19
on in the reading passage okay let's go
319:22
over these words here let's do the
319:23
exercises choose the word that best
319:25
completes a sentence can you beep this
319:28
math problem
319:30
so when you're looking at a math problem
319:33
sometimes math problems are difficult to
319:36
understand so we might ask our friend
319:39
can you what this math problem usually
319:41
maybe we're looking for a word like
319:43
solve or understand right
319:46
well what word means that a behave b
319:48
comprehend c orbit and d cover well of
319:52
course we're looking for comprehend can
319:54
you comprehend this math problem because
319:57
comprehend means do you understand this
320:00
math problem if you understand it
320:03
if you understand it then you can solve
320:06
the math problem first though you need
320:08
to comprehend it you need to understand
320:10
it once you understand it then you can
320:13
solve it right so not can you behave not
320:17
can you orbit
320:18
this math problem that's weird
320:21
can you cover this math problem oh i'm
320:23
afraid cover it hide it right that's
320:25
that's strange too what we want is can
320:27
you comprehend this math problem do you
320:30
understand it
320:32
okay next one is a command beep your
320:34
eyes you shouldn't see this so if your
320:37
friend says oh don't look right you want
320:39
to do this to your eyes what am i doing
320:42
right so i cannot see something am i
320:44
orbiting my eyes
320:47
that would be really weird right my eyes
320:48
turn around that's strange now i'm not
320:50
orbiting my eyes am i comprehending my
320:53
eyes well i understand my eyes but i can
320:56
still see that's weird right we don't
320:57
say that
320:59
make your eyes
321:01
how do you make your eyes that doesn't
321:02
make sense
321:04
cover ah
321:05
cover your eyes right so you have a
321:07
surprise i want to surprise you cover
321:10
your eyes open a surprise right so first
321:14
cover your eyes that's the answer cover
321:16
your eyes you shouldn't see this so you
321:19
don't want somebody to see something
321:21
cover your eyes
321:23
okay next one
321:25
number five
321:26
i have a short beep of time for lunch
321:29
so you have a certain length of time for
321:33
lunch it's a short length of time what
321:35
do we say i have a short orbit of time i
321:38
have a short pole of time i have a short
321:41
period of time or i have a short cover
321:44
of time which one sounds good probably
321:46
you chose period whoa that's too fast
321:49
okay but anyway i have a short period of
321:52
time i have a short period of time for
321:54
lunch so maybe only 30 minutes 30 minute
321:57
period for lunch not one hour just 30
321:59
minutes so it's a short period of time
322:01
now this one jumped up too quickly but
322:03
that's okay the north pole is in the
322:06
arctic remember we talked about pole
322:09
right we have a north pole and a south
322:11
pole those are the top and the bottom of
322:13
the earth and the north pole is in the
322:16
arctic not the north orbit not the north
322:19
cover not the north period that's weird
322:21
but the north pole the north pole is in
322:24
the arctic where is the south pole the
322:27
south pole is in the antarctic ant are
322:31
arctic yes if we can spell it right oh
322:34
yes we did okay arctic okay
322:37
you can see because arctic you just use
322:40
arctic here but antarctic means the
322:42
opposite antarctic okay so arctic
322:44
antarctic
322:46
okay well that wraps it up for the
322:48
vocabulary section next we're going to
322:51
use those words in the reading passage
322:53
so stay tuned don't go away
323:14
[Music]
323:14
you
