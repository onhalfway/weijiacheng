first take a look at a picture here

out of matrix the movie matrix right
what we can see is a lot of machinery
right there's a lot of
machinery oops let's write that slowly
ma sheen of course you know the word
machine but we're going to say machinery
because when we talk about many machines
working together
we can say machinery and these are
actually what kind of machines they are
robots
and they're in a factory and they build
things like
cars or big pieces of big things that we
use
okay so this this is a factory and
there's a lot of machinery
and there's a many robots in a factory
okay let's begin now with the vocabulary
our first word oh no

she made a mistake what is another word
for mistake we can say
error that's a little hymduro because
you have the two r's

error and that's too bad i hope it
doesn't hurt right
okay next one now here

uh type of scene of you've been to
coffee shops or you've been to stores
many times the person behind the counter
or in the store
is a person who has something they are
the owners sometimes they're the owners
the owner of the store
or the owner of the coffee shop of the
restaurant
whatever the person who owns the place
that is the owner they're not always the
owner sometimes they are the worker
right
but somebody who has something do you
have anything if you have something like
your book
bag or your pencil you are the
owner you are the owner of your bag
or your pencil or your book right or
your toy or your video game
you are the owner because you have it
you have
something okay next one
something made by people to do
work that's a head scratcher something
made by
people to do work what is it we talked
about it before
it's a machine right i told you
machinery
is when you have many machines working
together in one place we call it
machinery
but one is a machine it's something
people make it to do work for them
of course our modern lives are very easy
because we have many machines that do
our work a car is a machine
that does our work we don't have to walk
right
walking is work right but we can ride
so the machine does our work for us
right okay next one
looks interesting like a detective is
looking for something something that
helps to solve
a problem you guys know sherlock holmes
do you know sherlock holmes i hope so
sherlock holmes is a very
famous detective in british
literature right sherlock holmes is a
very
famous detective a detective goes to the
scene of a crime
and he looks with the magnifying glass
he tries to
find information that will help him
solve a problem what do we call those
little pieces
of information we call them a clue a
clue and if you have many usually you
have many clues right
detectives look for clues at the scene
of a crime
maybe not just one but maybe there are
several fingerprints
maybe old clothes blood oh i wonder what
happened right
but these are clues that help us to
solve
a problem especially when we want to
know who
did something okay okay next one
holiday oh very nice right do you want a
holiday
is it time for a holiday maybe you think
so this is a very nice place to take a
holiday
what's another word for holiday we can
say vacation
vacation vacation
okay so actually it's interesting
british people
british english they usually say they're
going on holiday
i'm going on holiday americans are more
commonly say vacation
i have a vacation coming up i'm going
on vacation so we go
on go on holiday
or go on a vacation british people will
say go on holiday
i am going on holiday americans will say
i'm going on
a vacation or you could just say i'm
going on vacation
that's okay too okay next one
okay what's going on here do you know
how to play tennis
do you have a tennis coach
if a person tells someone how to do
something there's a verb for that you're
probably thinking teach right
teach is good that's that's true but
there's another word
that means to tell someone how to do
something
what is that word you may not have heard
of it before
it's direct but if you think about it
you have heard this word before
especially if you like
movies right when people make movies
there are many actors
and actresses right well there's a
person in charge
who's telling the actors and actresses
how to act how to perform in the movie
we call that person a director
a movie director
a movie director because that is a
person
who directs the actors and actresses
on how to do something so direct is also
used when we want to say that something
is telling another person
how to do something someone or something
is telling another thing or person
how to do something that is direct
and usually direct is is on the spot
right
it's telling someone how to do something
right now
okay of course you can also use teach
right but it's a little bit different
right teachers usually give you
knowledge
directors tell you how to do something
right now okay so it's a little bit
different
but they're very similar okay next one
seven having many parts what is that
okay it looks like art is it a type of
machine
what do you think it does maybe it maybe
it makes people invisible that would be
cool huh but
i don't know what it does but anyway
it's having many parts there are a lot
of parts on it right
it looks what does it look it looks very
complex
it looks very complex complex
means it has many parts it's
a very uh so many different parts it's
very
difficult to figure out it's complex
another word complicated right
complicated you could also use that word
come
ted complicated complicated well that's
a complex word
it has many letters okay so that's very
interesting complex has many parts
it's complicated it has many parts it's
very difficult to figure out
okay next one oh oh
this guy's stupid what's he doing joshua
how does she right he's smoking
and these are fire crackers if that ash
falls
he's going to blow up he's crazy right
dangerous what's another word for
dangerous
whoa this is a complex word hazardous
hazardous hazardous of course if you
just say hazard
hazard is danger ous means
it's an adjective you're describing some
place
or some situation hazardous oh
that place is hazardous or that
situation
is hazardous extremely
extremely normal right extremely
hazardous this guy is crazy he's not
very smart
okay next one oh no
she looks like she's tired very tired
what's another word for very tired
we say fatigued fatigued
fatigued that's a little difficult if
you are fatigued
you are very tired maybe she's been
doing her homework
too much she's very tired she is
fatigued
okay next one a person who works
now a lot of people a lot of workers
have very difficult jobs right they work
with their hands
they lift things they use tools to do
things
what do we call them we call them
workers right just a worker
a worker for example a construction
worker construction is kung sujung right
kung
jiang that's construction area right so
a person who works there is
a worker construction worker but you can
also say
office worker right office worker you
could also say that
so people who work are called workers
very easily that's very easy word okay
next one to give something in exchange
for money so in this picture this person
looks like he's helping them to
i almost said the word i don't want to
say it yet okay he want
they want to get rid of their house but
they're not going to give it away
they're going to what they're going to
sell their house right they're gonna
sell their house
and look at the word the the word in the
picture here sold
cell is an irregular verb so we say
sell sold sold because it's passed
they sold the house they exchanged
the house for money they didn't give
away the house
right they want money in return for the
house
have you ever sold something maybe you
had
a like an old doll or an old
toy that you don't want anymore but you
don't want to throw it away
maybe you could sell it to a friend or
maybe a book
or a video game that you you're finished
with you don't want it anymore
you might sell it to somebody else so
you exchange it
for money okay next one
what's this this is a machine that sucks
sucks dirt and air off
the floor so it's right it sucks it up
what do we call this
we call it a whoa that's a big word
vacuum
cleaner vacuum cleaner okay
you know this machine right maybe you're
playing your game
and your mom starts using the vacuum
cleaner like mom
it's too noisy right it drives you crazy
but hey
mom has to clean right maybe you should
use the vacuum cleaner
help mom out right so that's good so
don't complain if the vacuum cleaner
you hear the vacuum cleaner and you're
trying to do something because
you want to have a clean house you don't
want dirt
all over the floor dirt and dust and if
you have a dog
little hair all over the floor you want
to be able to
suck that air up with a vacuum
cleaner by the way the vacuum cleaner is
another machine right so it's another
example
of many machines that make our lives
easier it does the work
for us it's very easy to use a vacuum
cleaner
instead of a broom right broom is
dirty and difficult to use vacuum
cleaner
is much easier yes it's noisy but it's
easier
okay next one to control a car
now actually the word is in this picture
right if the the word is drive and we
can see that word right here
drive right but this word is driver
so of course in english many verbs we
can change to noun
and we can say the person who does it
right before we saw
work er if we just use work that's a
verb
worker is a person drive
is a verb driver is a person
she will be a driver she is learning
she is a student driver so she is
learning
to drive to drive is to control a car
it's also an irregular verb so it
changes
form for the past tense we say drive
drove driven drive
drove driven okay so that is to control
a car
it's to drive a car can you drive a car
probably not yet but don't try it's
dangerous right it's hazardous
but when you're older you can learn how
to drive a car
but be careful always it's a dangerous
machine it's a hazardous
machine be careful be safe and you'll be
okay
okay a very large
sea so if you can see water water all
around for as far as you can see
and maybe it takes you days to sail
across that sea
we call that an ocean right there are
only
a few big oceans in the world right
there are only a few and they're very
big like a pacific ocean the atlantic
ocean the
indian ocean right we call those really
big
areas of water we call them an ocean
smaller
areas are called seas like the
mediterranean sea
the caribbean sea right those are
smaller areas of water
next one a short time to rest before we
talked about workers right
workers are people who do work well they
can't work all the time right
we need to take a break we need to drink
something or to eat something or go to
the bathroom
in that case we need to take a break
take a break right take
a break so we usually use it in this
expression
let's take a break do you want
to take a break hey everybody
it's time to take a break so take a
break
means to stop working and to rest for a
little bit
okay next one wow that's
great if you can throw a dart and you
can hit
exactly in the center no mistake
no error you have hit it perfectly
perfect it's perfect no mistakes
it's perfect it is perfect
so that is a perfect shot in this case
we would say
it's a perfect shot perfect
right on the middle a dot it's perfect
okay let's go over our vocabulary
exercises now
how well do you remember the words we
just studied
what we're going to do here is we have
many sentences
we need to choose the word that
best fits in the blanks in these
sentences
so these are our words here we have
eight words let's review those before we
look at the exercises
the first word is error
okay next is owner
owner the next one is machine
machine the next one is clue
clue the next one
vacation they vacation
vacation okay complex
complex next one
hazardous hazardous
hazardous next one is direct
direct okay let's take a look at
these sentences and figure out which
word
belongs in those blanks okay number one
the peep of this tall building
is very rich okay so usually
people are rich and think about it if
someone
has a tall building if someone has
a tall building a tall building wow
that's a lot of money
that person is very rich so what do we
call a person
who has something whether it's a tall
building
or just a small pencil we call that
person
the owner the owner by the way we use
the because there's only one there's
only one
owner of the building okay the owner of
the building
right if there's a pencil somebody owns
that pencil who is that person
that's only one person so we don't say a
owner of the pencil that's weird
because a means one of many but there's
only one owner
of this particular pencil so we say the
owner of this pencil
if only one person owns the building
then it's the owner
of the building now it's true many
people can own a building that's true
and we could say one of the owners of
this building
but in this case we're talking about the
owner that means there's only one person
so
usually we use the with owner because
usually there's only one person who owns
something okay if there are many people
who own the building
then we can say one of the owners but in
this case there's just one person
he's very rich wow okay two
you should push push this button
to turn on this what what do you
turn on by pushing a button what thing
here
is turned on by pushing a button usually
when you push a button
it makes electricity go to a certain
thing it's probably a thing that uses
electricity
to do people's work so what do we call
that thing
we call that thing a machine right a
machine
usually you push a button and it turns
on think about your computer
your computer is a machine you push a
button it turns on
your vacuum cleaner is a machine usually
you can push a button
on the vacuum cleaner sometimes they
have a switch but
it's a switch or a button you push it
and it turns on
okay okay so that's a machine number
three
i asked him to beep the project
you asked him to do what with the
project
now what word would fit in there if you
want somebody
to take control of a project right
you want him to direct the project and
to tell
other people what to do so he tells
other people what to do on the project
you asked him to direct the project
okay next slide four five and six
number four i'm going to visit cheju
island chajudo have you ever been to
cheshire but anyway
i'm going to visit cejudo island during
the summer
beep now when people have
time off right and they want to go
on a holiday right
they usually go somewhere they have a
holiday destination
another word for holiday especially
during the summer
when you don't have to go to school we
can say summer vacation
summer vacation you also have a winter
vacation
it's good being a student right you have
a lot of time off in the summer
you have a lot of time off of school in
the winter
we can call it summer vacation or winter
vacation
what will you do in the summer vacation
or what will you do during the winter
vacation
okay so occasion winter vacation this
person is going to visit cejado
on their summer vacation okay or during
their summer vacation
number five the problem was more peep
than i thought so think about this
there's a problem right and it's more
something than
you think if you think okay i have a
problem
maybe you think i'm going to solve it
it's going to be easy but then you see
the problem like oh wow this problem has
many more parts or many more
uh things about it that i didn't think
about
so it is more what than i thought what
is something that has
many parts to it it's more complex
than i thought this problem is more
complex
than i thought before i thought it was
easy but then i start doing the problem
oh my gosh
it's more complex than i thought it's
more difficult
than i thought okay number six i have no
beep to help me solve the problem
if you want to solve you want to solve a
problem
right you need some information that
will help you
find the answer we talked about that
right what is
something something that helps people
solve a problem
little things here and there what is
something that would help people like
sherlock holmes
solve the problem of like a crime scene
who did it
right so what word fits there i have no
clues i have no clues to help me solve
the problem
right you could say i have no clue but
usually
clues there's more than one clue at a
uh for a problem there are usually many
clues
but you could say i have no clue or
usually it's more common to say
i have no clues to help me solve this
problem
now sometimes people will say do you
know the answer and a very common
expression is
well i don't have a clue i don't have a
clue that's kind of just a set
expression that people will say
i don't even have one single clue i
don't have a clue
or he doesn't even have a clue means
he's kind of dumb
he doesn't understand how to do the
problem but don't use that
okay expression he doesn't have a clue
better to say
let's help him okay let's help him solve
the problem okay next two
seven and eight i felt foolish when i
made
an beep in my calculations well right
there and we know that it's going to
start with a vowel
right but what what's the other part of
the sentence that we can use
to figure this out i felt foolish when i
made a
when do you feel foolish when do you
feel foolish
you may feel foolish embarrassed oh
i'm sorry right you feel foolish when
you
make a mistake right when you make a
mistake
especially in your calculations sounds
like somebody's doing
a complex math problem
so they made a mistake what's another
word for mistake
over here right i felt foolish when i
made an
error in my calculations you make a
mistake in your calculations oops that
was dumb
now i feel foolish okay next one
eight if a place is beep then you
shouldn't
go because you might get
hurt you might get hurt it's a dangerous
place what's another word for
dangerous of course it has the same
ending as dangerous
we're looking at this word if a place is
hazardous then you shouldn't go because
you might get hurt
remember hazardous is a dangerous place
or situation
in this case it's a place if a place is
hazardous don't go there
you might get hurt and hazardous means
the same thing
as dangerous okay well that wraps up the

06:30
teach is good that's that's true but
06:32
there's another word
06:33
that means to tell someone how to do
06:36
something
06:37
what is that word you may not have heard
06:39
of it before
06:40

06:55
person in charge
06:57

07:00
how to act how to perform in the movie
07:04
we call that person a director

a movie director
07:10
a movie director because that is a
07:12
person
07:13
who directs the actors and actresses
07:17

it's telling someone how to do something
07:39
right now
07:40

10:32
things
10:33
what do we call them we call them
10:35

10:37
a worker for example a construction
10:41
worker construction is kung sujung right
10:44
kung
10:45
jiang that's construction area right so
10:48
a person who works there is
10:49
a worker construction worker but you can
10:52
also say
10:53
office worker right office worker you
10:55
could also say that
10:57
so people who work are called workers
11:00
very easily that's very easy word okay
11:04
next one to give something in exchange
11:07
for money so in this picture this person
11:11
looks like he's helping them to
11:15
i almost said the word i don't want to
11:16
say it yet okay he want
11:18
they want to get rid of their house but
11:20
they're not going to give it away
11:22
they're going to what they're going to
11:25
sell their house right they're gonna
11:27
sell their house
11:28
and look at the word the the word in the
11:31
picture here sold
11:32
cell is an irregular verb so we say
11:36
sell sold sold because it's passed
11:39
they sold the house they exchanged
11:42
the house for money they didn't give
11:44
away the house
11:45
right they want money in return for the
11:47
house
11:48
have you ever sold something maybe you
11:51
had
11:52
a like an old doll or an old
11:55
toy that you don't want anymore but you
11:58
don't want to throw it away
11:59
maybe you could sell it to a friend or
12:02
maybe a book
12:03
or a video game that you you're finished
12:05
with you don't want it anymore
12:07
you might sell it to somebody else so
12:10
you exchange it
12:11
for money okay next one
12:15
what's this this is a machine that sucks
12:19
sucks dirt and air off
12:23
the floor so it's right it sucks it up
12:25
what do we call this
12:27
we call it a whoa that's a big word
12:30
vacuum
12:31
cleaner vacuum cleaner okay
12:35
you know this machine right maybe you're
12:37
playing your game
12:38
and your mom starts using the vacuum
12:40
cleaner like mom
12:41
it's too noisy right it drives you crazy
12:44
but hey
12:45
mom has to clean right maybe you should
12:48
use the vacuum cleaner
12:49
help mom out right so that's good so
12:52
don't complain if the vacuum cleaner
12:54
you hear the vacuum cleaner and you're
12:56
trying to do something because
12:57
you want to have a clean house you don't
13:00
want dirt
13:01
all over the floor dirt and dust and if
13:04
you have a dog
13:05
little hair all over the floor you want
13:07
to be able to
13:08
suck that air up with a vacuum
13:11
cleaner by the way the vacuum cleaner is
13:14
another machine right so it's another
13:17
example
13:18
of many machines that make our lives
13:20
easier it does the work
13:22
for us it's very easy to use a vacuum
13:25
cleaner
13:25
instead of a broom right broom is
13:29
dirty and difficult to use vacuum
13:31
cleaner
13:32
is much easier yes it's noisy but it's
13:35
easier
13:36
okay next one to control a car
13:40
now actually the word is in this picture
13:42
right if the the word is drive and we
13:44
can see that word right here
13:46
drive right but this word is driver
13:50
so of course in english many verbs we
13:53
can change to noun
13:55
and we can say the person who does it
13:57
right before we saw
13:58
work er if we just use work that's a
14:02
verb
14:02
worker is a person drive
14:05
is a verb driver is a person
14:09
she will be a driver she is learning
14:12
she is a student driver so she is
14:15
learning
14:16
to drive to drive is to control a car
14:19
it's also an irregular verb so it
14:22
changes
14:22
form for the past tense we say drive
14:26
drove driven drive
14:30
drove driven okay so that is to control
14:33
a car
14:34
it's to drive a car can you drive a car
14:37
probably not yet but don't try it's
14:40
dangerous right it's hazardous
14:42
but when you're older you can learn how
14:44
to drive a car
14:45
but be careful always it's a dangerous
14:47
machine it's a hazardous
14:49
machine be careful be safe and you'll be
14:52
okay
14:53
okay a very large
14:56
sea so if you can see water water all
14:59
around for as far as you can see
15:01
and maybe it takes you days to sail
15:04
across that sea
15:05
we call that an ocean right there are
15:09
only
15:09
a few big oceans in the world right
15:13
there are only a few and they're very
15:14
big like a pacific ocean the atlantic
15:17
ocean the
15:17
indian ocean right we call those really
15:20
big
15:21
areas of water we call them an ocean
15:24
smaller
15:24
areas are called seas like the
15:26
mediterranean sea
15:28
the caribbean sea right those are
15:31
smaller areas of water
15:34
next one a short time to rest before we
15:36
talked about workers right
15:38
workers are people who do work well they
15:40
can't work all the time right
15:42
we need to take a break we need to drink
15:45
something or to eat something or go to
15:47
the bathroom
15:48
in that case we need to take a break
15:51
take a break right take
15:57
a break so we usually use it in this
15:59
expression
16:00
let's take a break do you want
16:04
to take a break hey everybody
16:07
it's time to take a break so take a
16:10
break
16:10
means to stop working and to rest for a
16:13
little bit
16:14
okay next one wow that's
16:18
great if you can throw a dart and you
16:20
can hit
16:21
exactly in the center no mistake
16:25
no error you have hit it perfectly
16:29
perfect it's perfect no mistakes
16:32
it's perfect it is perfect
16:35
so that is a perfect shot in this case
16:38
we would say
16:39
it's a perfect shot perfect
16:42
right on the middle a dot it's perfect
16:46
okay let's go over our vocabulary
16:49
exercises now
16:50
how well do you remember the words we
16:53
just studied
16:55
what we're going to do here is we have
16:57
many sentences
16:59
we need to choose the word that
17:02
best fits in the blanks in these
17:05
sentences
17:06
so these are our words here we have
17:09
eight words let's review those before we
17:12
look at the exercises
17:13
the first word is error
17:17
okay next is owner
17:20
owner the next one is machine
17:25
machine the next one is clue
17:29
clue the next one
17:32
vacation they vacation
17:36
vacation okay complex
17:40
complex next one
17:43
hazardous hazardous
17:46
hazardous next one is direct
17:50
direct okay let's take a look at
17:54
these sentences and figure out which
17:57
word
17:57
belongs in those blanks okay number one
18:00
the peep of this tall building
18:04
is very rich okay so usually
18:08
people are rich and think about it if
18:11
someone
18:12
has a tall building if someone has
18:15
a tall building a tall building wow
18:18
that's a lot of money
18:19
that person is very rich so what do we
18:22
call a person
18:23
who has something whether it's a tall
18:27
building
18:27
or just a small pencil we call that
18:30
person
18:31
the owner the owner by the way we use
18:34
the because there's only one there's
18:38
only one
18:38
owner of the building okay the owner of
18:41
the building
18:42
right if there's a pencil somebody owns
18:44
that pencil who is that person
18:46
that's only one person so we don't say a
18:48
owner of the pencil that's weird
18:50
because a means one of many but there's
18:53
only one owner
18:54
of this particular pencil so we say the
18:57
owner of this pencil
18:58
if only one person owns the building
19:01
then it's the owner
19:02
of the building now it's true many
19:05
people can own a building that's true
19:07
and we could say one of the owners of
19:09
this building
19:10
but in this case we're talking about the
19:12
owner that means there's only one person
19:14
so
19:15
usually we use the with owner because
19:18
usually there's only one person who owns
19:20
something okay if there are many people
19:23
who own the building
19:24
then we can say one of the owners but in
19:26
this case there's just one person
19:28
he's very rich wow okay two
19:32
you should push push this button
19:36
to turn on this what what do you
19:39
turn on by pushing a button what thing
19:43

19:48
it makes electricity go to a certain
19:52
thing it's probably a thing that uses
19:54
electricity
19:55
to do people's work so what do we call
19:58
that thing
19:59
we call that thing a machine right a
20:01
machine
20:02
usually you push a button and it turns
20:04
on think about your computer
20:06
your computer is a machine you push a
20:08

20:10
your vacuum cleaner is a machine usually
20:13
you can push a button
20:15
on the vacuum cleaner sometimes they
20:16
have a switch but
20:18
it's a switch or a button you push it
20:20
