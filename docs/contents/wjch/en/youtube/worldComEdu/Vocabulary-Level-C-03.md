hello everybody
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
i'm brian stewart
we're going over lesson three here
lesson three is
what's after seven what's after seven
dinner no we're talking about math right
so when we talk about what's after seven
we're talking about
counting right so did you know there is
an
elephant that can count so we talk about
count
one two three four five
six seven what's after seven
i don't know oh alright it's eight right
what's after
seven it's eight okay so of course it
depends on
what you're talking about what's after
seven oh dinner time no
we're talking about math counting so
what's after seven
it's eight okay so that's we're going to
learn about in this lesson
something very interesting about an
animal an elephant
that can count that's very strange right
well let's get right away let's go into
the vocabulary
that we need to know these words in
order to study the
reading passage later on now the first
word we have
is to find something to find something
now that's an interesting picture
looks like a scuba diver just came up
and he found something
on the bottom of the ocean what did he
do
he discovered something he discovered
something by the way doesn't he look
familiar
he's a famous actor matthew mcconaughey
okay
maybe you've seen him in a movie before
but in this movie
he discovered something at the bottom of
the ocean
so when you find something you discover
it
okay next word well we have many apples
here
many green apples there's one red apple
to change one thing for another so let's
say this person
says okay i'm going to take the the red
apple and i'm going to put a green
apple in its place in this case you
could say
switch they're going to switch apples
right
so they switch this red apple they take
it out and they put a green one
in its place that means you switched
them
to switch okay number three
oh person is doing exercise can you do
this exercise
uh it's called a push-up by the way
that's not the word but just so you know
this is called a push-up push-up she's
doing
push-ups right you could do sit-ups
right
this is a push-up but when you do
push-ups
you don't just do one right you do them
again
you basically you repeat the exercise
right
so you say i can do push-ups one i'm
done
no you have to repeat right do it ten
times right do one push-up two push-ups
three push-ups
you repeat you do again so when you
exercise
you do the exercise again you repeat
the exercise many times
number four very smart girl right she's
going to be a chemist when she grows up
she's studying chemistry
now chemist by the way how do you say
that chemist
chemist a chemist is a type of scientist
what do scientists do they have tests
to see what happens scientists have many
questions about the world
so they have many tests to see what will
happen
if they do something and we call that
another word for that test
is called then oh this is a really long
word experiment
so long right experiment
so how many sounds ex beer
er
let's put them all together experiment
experiment so an experiment
is specifically what a scientist like a
chemist
does to see what happens it's a test a
type of test
a very specific type of test there are
many kinds of tests
you take a test in school that's not an
experiment
an experiment is when a scientist does
something
to see what will happen that's an
experiment
okay next one oh this is a very
interesting picture isn't it
to choose now it's important to choose
wisely right you see this picture here
this person chose a hamburger
you see this person chose
an apple you see
very important to choose the right thing
person who chose a hamburger is kind of
fat right
but this person who chose the apple
their they're not so
fat they're in good shape okay but you
choose something
another word to choose is to select
you select one thing or the other thing
will you select a hamburger then you
will look like me
right if you select the apple you'll
look like i did 20 years ago
okay so depending on what you choose
that's important depending on what you
select what will you
select okay next one
a container for holding something this
is a container there are
many different kinds of containers that
hold things right
this is a special type of container
it holds water it has a handle that you
can carry it
we call this container a bucket
a bucket is usually used to carry water
or sand or something else and you can
many buckets have a handle that you can
carry it around with
okay buckets are good for carrying heavy
things
but we call this type of container a
bucket they're made of metal
or plastic so plastic bucket metal
bucket
this one's made of metal next one oh
what's he doing it looks familiar he's
teaching right
a university teacher but he's not just a
teacher
right in your elementary school your
middle school your high school
you can call those uh people teachers
but at a university they have a special
word for that type of teacher
they call them professor professor
professor professor that's the word
for a teacher who teaches at a
university
you don't call your teacher in high
school a professor
you just say teacher but when you go to
college or you go to university
then you say professor okay
next one there's a group of people here
they look
very surprised to surprise someone
greatly
now when you surprise someone greatly
especially it means you
scare them a little bit right that means
you shock them oh my gosh
right you say oh i am shocked right
you surprised someone really a lot to
shock them he shocked them
okay next one now she looks a little
frustrated right
something that is wrong something of
course
with computers many things go wrong
right
so we can say it is a mistake
okay hopefully she didn't make the
mistake maybe the computer made the
mistake
but anyway something went wrong
something
wrong happened it is a mistake
so it's a mistake okay next one
to make it difficult for someone to
think clearly
this person is buried under many a lot
of work right they have so many things
to do
it's difficult for them to think clearly
they are confused they don't know what
to do
should i do this job should i do this
job well the phone's ringing my boss is
calling me
ah i'm confused right to confuse
confuse confuse
confuse i'm very confused i don't know
what to do
eleven well this guy's pretty smart
right
he's doing what is he doing well the
study of numbers
he's figuring out uh how to
not just add and subtract but also
multiply
and divide he's studying math
did you hear what i said add
subtract that's
simple math right if you add and
subtract that's simple math
add is like plus or minus but i also
said multiply
multiply oops multiply
and divide that's more difficult
math right that's multiply we usually
use that symbol
and to divide we use that symbol okay
so add subtract multiply divide
this is all the study of math and the
type of math he's doing is
algebra this is algebra
there are many types of math right there
are many types of math
there's simple math doing this there's
algebra there's trigonometry
there's calculus calculus is very
difficult right
but algebra probably you will study
algebra maybe you're studying
algebra now oh by the way isn't this
picture a little strange
think about it he's writing but he's
writing backwards
he's writing backwards so you can see
what he's writing but
if you look at the picture closely you
see oh something strange about the
picture
by the way it's also interesting to
notice you know i'm just getting on
onto some of these b equals 2. if you do
these problems
these problems work out and if i'll just
give you the answer
a what does a equal a equals 5.
look at it later okay we're studying
words now but if you want to
look at the math a equals 5. do it later
okay
twelve intelligent somebody who's
intelligent
okay what do we call them we call them
smart
are you smart of course you're smart
you're studying with me
right i'm sorry you're studying with
these textbooks
uh so you will you're smart right
because you're intelligent
um if you know a lot of things it's
interesting to
look at this word intelligent and smart
intelligent
doesn't mean that you have a lot of
knowledge
intelligence means that you can learn
quickly you can learn the knowledge
there's a difference between being
intelligent
and being wise if somebody is
wise that means they have a lot of
experience
and they know from life what to do
but somebody who's intelligent has the
ability
intelligent is like ability ability
to learn and if you're smart you can
learn quickly
okay so that's interesting 13
with no error with no error no mistakes
you've got it perfectly or exactly
exactly correct that's like uh
right that's like exactly perfect
exactly right right no problems no
errors okay next one why
something happened oh no it's too bad
she got an f it's
there's some reason what is the reason
she got an f the reason explains
why something happened we we don't know
but we can
think there are many reasons why she got
an f one
she didn't sleep last night two
she didn't study three she played a
video game
all night there are many reasons
why something happened many reasons why
somebody would get an
f so i hope that doesn't happen to you
make sure
there is no reason for you to get an f
there should only be a reason for you to
get an
a okay number 15 to make a point
in a test or a game to make a point or
when you look at the points
for both teams or for people we're
talking about the score
so when we use the word score a very
common question
is what is
the score so
imagine korea and japan
are playing a soccer game right and you
want to know
what is the score then of course you say
well korea
has eight points and japan has
zero right that's the score eight to
zero
eight to zero okay maybe
okay what's the score what are the
points that each
team got or each person got that's
the score when we talk about the score
we usually talk about
both teams eight to zero okay or you
could say
what is your score on a test because
it's also a test
my score was 89.
that's pretty good but it's better if
your score is a hundred right
that's a perfect score so hopefully you
get a hundred
okay that would be a score on a test
okay the next word to think
that something is true so if you think
something is true
you believe in something in this case we
have a picture of santa claus
do you believe in santa claus of course
in that case you think that santa claus
is real and
it's true um that to believe something
to think
that something is true you believe
in something okay okay well let's go
over the
vocabulary exercises exercise number one
what is our directions complete each
sentence
with a word from the box so we have
eight words in the box we're going to
have eight
sentences to fill in the blanks
each sentence we have to choose which
word goes into the blank for the
sentence
we have a lot of words what are they of
course these are words we just studied
the first one is discovered
discovered remember we studied the word
discover
but now we're using it in the past tense
discovered
okay bucket we learned singular bucket
more than one bucket is buckets buckets
okay next one repeat to do over
repeat but this one is repeated
repeated okay next one
we learned shock but remember we can say
shocked
shocked okay next one
experiment there's our really long word
right
experiment experiment
okay next one switch
switch okay
switch that might be a little difficult
with the sw
you exchange or you move one for the
other
switch select
select ted okay selected
selected next one professor
professor okay those are the words let's
see
if we can put these into these sentences
correctly
i hope so number one he will beep
the old bucket with a new one
so think about that we have two things
here right we have an old bucket
we have a new one so we have two buckets
we have an old bucket
and a new bucket what were you what are
we going to do
we're going to take the old bucket maybe
throw it away
and we're going to use the new bucket so
what are we doing in this case
right we're taking one removing it
and putting another one in its place
so in that case we are going to
switch switch he will
switch the old bucket with a new one
and this is probably what you do in your
life too if you have something that's
old or broken
you throw it away or you get rid of it
and you put a new one
instead for example batteries you switch
the battery in your phone don't throw
away your old battery
recharge it but maybe you have two
batteries so you switch them
the new battery for the old one you
recharge the old one that's a good
example
switch switch batteries two
the beep wants to give the elephant a
math test
okay that's an interesting sentence
that's part of the reading by the way
okay
so if somebody wants to give a elephant
a math test
who would do that right think about that
and we need a person right
the professor wants to give the elephant
a math test basically that's the only
one that we can use here
because professor is a person right and
that's the only person
we've got up here so the professor wants
to give the elephant
a math test okay number two
the workers beep gold and diamonds in
the cave
what do the workers do they there's gold
and diamonds in a cave how do they
what are they going to do with those
things now not all caves have golden
diamonds too bad
right if you go to a cave there's
probably not going to be golden diamonds
in there
but if you're looking around oh look if
you find the golden diamonds there what
did you do
you discovered golden diamonds in the
cave
okay so discovered they discovered
golden diamonds
they found golden diamonds in the cave
okay the next one
they beep the same test three
times three times
they did it three times not just once
but they did it again
and again and one more time again okay
so what word means that you do something
not just once but twice or three times
or four times right
what means that you do something more
than once that's this word right here
repeated they repeated the same test
three times okay that's the word that
makes sense there
number five fill the beep with
water from the well ah okay
remember we looked at this uh container
that holds
something and it's usually this
container is made of metal or plastic
and of course i said you usually use it
to carry water or sand or something
that's heavy
what is it what is that container that
we use to carry stuff
ah there it is right there bucket fill
the buckets
with water from the well okay
the next one six the scientist is doing
and
what in the lab what do scientists
do remember before i talked about a
scientist has
many questions about the world they want
to
make tests to see if the question is yes
or no
will this thing burn if i increase the
temperature
that is what that is an experiment
the scientist is doing an experiment in
the lab okay our last two sentences
a shia a shia is a name it's the name of
the elephant in the reading passage that
we're going to read
ashia peep the one with
more apples in it so if you've read the
passage already
what did a shia the elephant do a shia
the elephant
right there's one with more apples so
you think there's more than one
right you've got one here you've got one
here maybe there's two or three or four
in the reading they talk about just two
but she is going to
right take or pick
or what what is she going to do what is
the elephant going to do
the elephant is going to select as she
has selected the one
with more apples in it select choose
okay number eight are you beep
that an elephant can count
so the fact that an elephant can
count that's really surprising isn't it
that's
really amazing and it might be so
surprising that
right it's like oh my gosh i can't
believe it right
it what means that what word has
something to do with something that you
find out that you discover
and it's really surprising some really
surprising information
what word has to do with that well of
course shocked
are you shocked that an elephant can
count did you know that
that's really shocking news that's
amazing news
okay well that wraps up the exercise for
the vocabulary
and we've learned a lot of different
words so now we're going to use those
we're going to see those words in a
reading passage so we're going to take a
short break come back and look at the
reading passage

00:08
hello everybody
00:09
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
00:12
i'm brian stewart
00:13
we're going over lesson three here
00:15
lesson three is
00:16
what's after seven what's after seven
00:20
dinner no we're talking about math right
00:24
so when we talk about what's after seven
00:27
we're talking about
00:28
counting right so did you know there is
00:31
an
00:31
elephant that can count so we talk about
00:35
count
00:35
one two three four five
00:39
six seven what's after seven
00:42
i don't know oh alright it's eight right
00:45
what's after
00:46
seven it's eight okay so of course it
00:49
depends on
00:49
what you're talking about what's after
00:51
seven oh dinner time no
00:53
we're talking about math counting so
00:55
what's after seven
00:56
it's eight okay so that's we're going to
00:58
learn about in this lesson
01:00
something very interesting about an
01:02
animal an elephant
01:04
that can count that's very strange right
01:07
well let's get right away let's go into
01:10
the vocabulary
01:11
that we need to know these words in
01:13
order to study the
01:15
reading passage later on now the first
01:18
word we have
01:19
is to find something to find something
01:22
now that's an interesting picture
01:24
looks like a scuba diver just came up
01:26
and he found something
01:28
on the bottom of the ocean what did he
01:30
do
01:31
he discovered something he discovered
01:35
something by the way doesn't he look
01:37
familiar
01:38
he's a famous actor matthew mcconaughey
01:41
okay
01:41
maybe you've seen him in a movie before
01:43
but in this movie
01:45
he discovered something at the bottom of
01:48
the ocean
01:49
so when you find something you discover
01:51
it
01:52
okay next word well we have many apples
01:55
here
01:56
many green apples there's one red apple
01:59
to change one thing for another so let's
02:02
say this person
02:03
says okay i'm going to take the the red
02:05
apple and i'm going to put a green
02:08
apple in its place in this case you
02:11
could say
02:12
switch they're going to switch apples
02:15
right
02:15
so they switch this red apple they take
02:18
it out and they put a green one
02:20
in its place that means you switched
02:22
them
02:23
to switch okay number three
02:26
oh person is doing exercise can you do
02:29
this exercise
02:31
uh it's called a push-up by the way
02:32
that's not the word but just so you know
02:35
this is called a push-up push-up she's
02:38
doing
02:39
push-ups right you could do sit-ups
02:42
right
02:42
this is a push-up but when you do
02:45
push-ups
02:46
you don't just do one right you do them
02:49
again
02:50
you basically you repeat the exercise
02:53
right
02:54
so you say i can do push-ups one i'm
02:56
done
02:57
no you have to repeat right do it ten
03:00
times right do one push-up two push-ups
03:03
three push-ups
03:05
you repeat you do again so when you
03:08
exercise
03:09
you do the exercise again you repeat
03:12
the exercise many times
03:15
number four very smart girl right she's
03:18
going to be a chemist when she grows up
03:20
she's studying chemistry
03:22
now chemist by the way how do you say
03:25
that chemist
03:27
chemist a chemist is a type of scientist
03:30
what do scientists do they have tests
03:34
to see what happens scientists have many
03:37
questions about the world
03:39
so they have many tests to see what will
03:42
happen
03:42
if they do something and we call that
03:45
another word for that test
03:47
is called then oh this is a really long
03:49
word experiment
03:52
so long right experiment
03:55
so how many sounds ex beer
03:58
er
04:04
let's put them all together experiment
04:07
experiment so an experiment
04:11
is specifically what a scientist like a
04:14
chemist
04:15
does to see what happens it's a test a
04:18
type of test
04:19
a very specific type of test there are
04:21
many kinds of tests
04:22
you take a test in school that's not an
04:25
experiment
04:26
an experiment is when a scientist does
04:30
something
04:30
to see what will happen that's an
04:32
experiment
04:34
okay next one oh this is a very
04:37
interesting picture isn't it
04:39
to choose now it's important to choose
04:42
wisely right you see this picture here
04:46
this person chose a hamburger
04:51
you see this person chose
04:54
an apple you see
04:57
very important to choose the right thing
05:00
person who chose a hamburger is kind of
05:03
fat right
05:05
but this person who chose the apple
05:08
their they're not so
05:11
fat they're in good shape okay but you
05:13
choose something
05:14
another word to choose is to select
05:18
you select one thing or the other thing
05:21
will you select a hamburger then you
05:24
will look like me
05:25
right if you select the apple you'll
05:28
look like i did 20 years ago
05:31
okay so depending on what you choose
05:34
that's important depending on what you
05:36
select what will you
05:38
select okay next one
05:41
a container for holding something this
05:44
is a container there are
05:45
many different kinds of containers that
05:48
hold things right
05:50
this is a special type of container
05:53
it holds water it has a handle that you
05:56
can carry it
05:58
we call this container a bucket
06:01
a bucket is usually used to carry water
06:05
or sand or something else and you can
06:08
many buckets have a handle that you can
06:11
carry it around with
06:12
okay buckets are good for carrying heavy
06:15
things
06:16
but we call this type of container a
06:18
bucket they're made of metal
06:20
or plastic so plastic bucket metal
06:23
bucket
06:24
this one's made of metal next one oh
06:28
what's he doing it looks familiar he's
06:30
teaching right
06:32
a university teacher but he's not just a
06:34
teacher
06:35
right in your elementary school your
06:37
middle school your high school
06:39
you can call those uh people teachers
06:42
but at a university they have a special
06:44
word for that type of teacher
06:47
they call them professor professor
06:51
professor professor that's the word
06:54
for a teacher who teaches at a
06:56
university
06:57
you don't call your teacher in high
06:59
school a professor
07:00
you just say teacher but when you go to
07:03
college or you go to university
07:05
then you say professor okay
07:08
next one there's a group of people here
07:11
they look
07:12
very surprised to surprise someone
07:15
greatly
07:16
now when you surprise someone greatly
07:18
especially it means you
07:20
scare them a little bit right that means
07:23
you shock them oh my gosh
07:27
right you say oh i am shocked right
07:30
you surprised someone really a lot to
07:34
shock them he shocked them
07:37
okay next one now she looks a little
07:40
frustrated right
07:41
something that is wrong something of
07:43
course
07:44
with computers many things go wrong
07:47
right
07:47
so we can say it is a mistake
07:50
okay hopefully she didn't make the
07:52
mistake maybe the computer made the
07:54
mistake
07:54
but anyway something went wrong
07:57
something
07:58
wrong happened it is a mistake
08:01
so it's a mistake okay next one
08:05
to make it difficult for someone to
08:07
think clearly
08:10
this person is buried under many a lot
08:12
of work right they have so many things
08:14
to do
08:15
it's difficult for them to think clearly
08:17
they are confused they don't know what
08:19
to do
08:20
should i do this job should i do this
08:21
job well the phone's ringing my boss is
08:23
calling me
08:24
ah i'm confused right to confuse
08:29
confuse confuse
08:32
confuse i'm very confused i don't know
08:35
what to do
08:37
eleven well this guy's pretty smart
08:40
right
08:40
he's doing what is he doing well the
08:43
study of numbers
08:44
he's figuring out uh how to
08:48
not just add and subtract but also
08:51
multiply
08:52
and divide he's studying math
08:55
did you hear what i said add
08:58
subtract that's
09:02
simple math right if you add and
09:04
subtract that's simple math
09:06
add is like plus or minus but i also
09:09
said multiply
09:12
multiply oops multiply
09:15
and divide that's more difficult
09:19
math right that's multiply we usually
09:22
use that symbol
09:23
and to divide we use that symbol okay
09:26
so add subtract multiply divide
09:30
this is all the study of math and the
09:32
type of math he's doing is
09:34
algebra this is algebra
09:39
there are many types of math right there
09:41
are many types of math
09:42
there's simple math doing this there's
09:45
algebra there's trigonometry
09:47
there's calculus calculus is very
09:49
difficult right
09:50
but algebra probably you will study
09:52
algebra maybe you're studying
09:54
algebra now oh by the way isn't this
09:57
picture a little strange
09:58
think about it he's writing but he's
10:00
writing backwards
10:04
he's writing backwards so you can see
10:05
what he's writing but
10:07
if you look at the picture closely you
10:08
see oh something strange about the
10:10
picture
10:11
by the way it's also interesting to
10:12
notice you know i'm just getting on
10:14
onto some of these b equals 2. if you do
10:17
these problems
10:18
these problems work out and if i'll just
10:21
give you the answer
10:22
a what does a equal a equals 5.
10:25
look at it later okay we're studying
10:27
words now but if you want to
10:29
look at the math a equals 5. do it later
10:31
okay
10:32
twelve intelligent somebody who's
10:35
intelligent
10:37
okay what do we call them we call them
10:39
smart
10:40
are you smart of course you're smart
10:42
you're studying with me
10:43
right i'm sorry you're studying with
10:46
these textbooks
10:47
uh so you will you're smart right
10:50
because you're intelligent
10:52
um if you know a lot of things it's
10:55
interesting to
10:56
look at this word intelligent and smart
10:59
intelligent
11:00
doesn't mean that you have a lot of
11:02
knowledge
11:04
intelligence means that you can learn
11:07
quickly you can learn the knowledge
11:10
there's a difference between being
11:11
intelligent
11:12
and being wise if somebody is
11:16
wise that means they have a lot of
11:18
experience
11:19
and they know from life what to do
11:23
but somebody who's intelligent has the
11:25
ability
11:26
intelligent is like ability ability
11:31
to learn and if you're smart you can
11:33
learn quickly
11:34
okay so that's interesting 13
11:37
with no error with no error no mistakes
11:40
you've got it perfectly or exactly
11:45
exactly correct that's like uh
11:49
right that's like exactly perfect
11:53
exactly right right no problems no
11:56
errors okay next one why
11:59
something happened oh no it's too bad
12:02
she got an f it's
12:05
there's some reason what is the reason
12:08
she got an f the reason explains
12:10
why something happened we we don't know
12:14
but we can
12:15
think there are many reasons why she got
12:17
an f one
12:18
she didn't sleep last night two
12:21
she didn't study three she played a
12:24
video game
12:26
all night there are many reasons
12:29
why something happened many reasons why
12:32
somebody would get an
12:33
f so i hope that doesn't happen to you
12:36
make sure
12:37
there is no reason for you to get an f
12:39
there should only be a reason for you to
12:41
get an
12:42
a okay number 15 to make a point
12:46
in a test or a game to make a point or
12:49
when you look at the points
12:51
for both teams or for people we're
12:53
talking about the score
12:55
so when we use the word score a very
12:58
common question
12:59
is what is
13:02
the score so
13:06
imagine korea and japan
13:10
are playing a soccer game right and you
13:12
want to know
13:13
what is the score then of course you say
13:17
well korea
13:18
has eight points and japan has
13:21
zero right that's the score eight to
13:24
zero
13:25
eight to zero okay maybe
13:28
okay what's the score what are the
13:30
points that each
13:31
team got or each person got that's
13:35
the score when we talk about the score
13:37
we usually talk about
13:38
both teams eight to zero okay or you
13:41
could say
13:42
what is your score on a test because
13:44
it's also a test
13:46
my score was 89.
13:49
that's pretty good but it's better if
13:51
your score is a hundred right
13:53
that's a perfect score so hopefully you
13:56
get a hundred
13:57
okay that would be a score on a test
14:01
okay the next word to think
14:04
that something is true so if you think
14:07
something is true
14:08
you believe in something in this case we
14:12
have a picture of santa claus
14:14
do you believe in santa claus of course
14:16
in that case you think that santa claus
14:18
is real and
14:19
it's true um that to believe something
14:22
to think
14:23
that something is true you believe
14:26
in something okay okay well let's go
14:29
over the
14:30
vocabulary exercises exercise number one
14:33
what is our directions complete each
14:35
sentence
14:36
with a word from the box so we have
14:39
eight words in the box we're going to
14:42
have eight
14:42
sentences to fill in the blanks
14:46
each sentence we have to choose which
14:48
word goes into the blank for the
14:50
sentence
14:51
we have a lot of words what are they of
14:53
course these are words we just studied
14:54
the first one is discovered
14:58
discovered remember we studied the word
15:00
discover
15:01
but now we're using it in the past tense
15:04
discovered
15:05
okay bucket we learned singular bucket
15:09
more than one bucket is buckets buckets
15:13
okay next one repeat to do over
15:17
repeat but this one is repeated
15:20
repeated okay next one
15:24
we learned shock but remember we can say
15:26
shocked
15:28
shocked okay next one
15:31
experiment there's our really long word
15:34
right
15:34
experiment experiment
15:37
okay next one switch
15:41
switch okay
15:44
switch that might be a little difficult
15:47
with the sw
15:48
you exchange or you move one for the
15:51
other
15:52
switch select
15:56
select ted okay selected
15:59
selected next one professor
16:02
professor okay those are the words let's
16:05
see
16:06
if we can put these into these sentences
16:09
correctly
16:09
i hope so number one he will beep
16:13
the old bucket with a new one
16:16
so think about that we have two things
16:18
here right we have an old bucket
16:20
we have a new one so we have two buckets
16:22
we have an old bucket
16:23
and a new bucket what were you what are
16:25
we going to do
16:26
we're going to take the old bucket maybe
16:28
throw it away
16:29
and we're going to use the new bucket so
16:31
what are we doing in this case
16:33
right we're taking one removing it
16:36
and putting another one in its place
16:39
so in that case we are going to
16:42
switch switch he will
16:46
switch the old bucket with a new one
16:49
and this is probably what you do in your
16:51
life too if you have something that's
16:53
old or broken
16:55
you throw it away or you get rid of it
16:58
and you put a new one
16:59
instead for example batteries you switch
17:02
the battery in your phone don't throw
17:05
away your old battery
17:06
recharge it but maybe you have two
17:08
batteries so you switch them
17:10
the new battery for the old one you
17:12
recharge the old one that's a good
17:14
example
17:14
switch switch batteries two
17:18
the beep wants to give the elephant a
17:21
math test
17:23
okay that's an interesting sentence
17:24
that's part of the reading by the way
17:26
okay
17:26
so if somebody wants to give a elephant
17:30
a math test
17:31
who would do that right think about that
17:33
and we need a person right
17:35
the professor wants to give the elephant
17:38
a math test basically that's the only
17:41
one that we can use here
17:42
because professor is a person right and
17:45
that's the only person
17:46
we've got up here so the professor wants
17:48
to give the elephant
17:49
a math test okay number two
17:53
the workers beep gold and diamonds in
17:55
the cave
17:58
what do the workers do they there's gold
18:01
and diamonds in a cave how do they
18:05
what are they going to do with those
18:06
things now not all caves have golden
18:09
diamonds too bad
18:10
right if you go to a cave there's
18:12
probably not going to be golden diamonds
18:13
in there
18:14
but if you're looking around oh look if
18:16
you find the golden diamonds there what
18:18
did you do
18:19
you discovered golden diamonds in the
18:23
cave
18:23
okay so discovered they discovered
18:25
golden diamonds
18:26
they found golden diamonds in the cave
18:29
okay the next one
18:31
they beep the same test three
18:34
times three times
18:38
they did it three times not just once
18:40
but they did it again
18:42
and again and one more time again okay
18:45
so what word means that you do something
18:48
not just once but twice or three times
18:52
or four times right
18:53
what means that you do something more
18:55
than once that's this word right here
18:57
repeated they repeated the same test
19:00
three times okay that's the word that
19:03
makes sense there
19:04
number five fill the beep with
19:08
water from the well ah okay
19:11
remember we looked at this uh container
19:14
that holds
19:14
something and it's usually this
19:16
container is made of metal or plastic
19:19
and of course i said you usually use it
19:21
to carry water or sand or something
19:23
that's heavy
19:24
what is it what is that container that
19:27
we use to carry stuff
19:29
ah there it is right there bucket fill
19:31
the buckets
19:32
with water from the well okay
19:36
the next one six the scientist is doing
19:39
and
19:40
what in the lab what do scientists
19:43
do remember before i talked about a
19:46
scientist has
19:48
many questions about the world they want
19:51
to
19:52
make tests to see if the question is yes
19:56
or no
19:56
will this thing burn if i increase the
20:00
temperature
20:01
that is what that is an experiment
20:04
the scientist is doing an experiment in
20:08
the lab okay our last two sentences
20:12
a shia a shia is a name it's the name of
20:16
the elephant in the reading passage that
20:18
we're going to read
20:19
ashia peep the one with
20:22
more apples in it so if you've read the
20:26
passage already
20:27
what did a shia the elephant do a shia
20:30
the elephant
20:31
right there's one with more apples so
20:33
you think there's more than one
20:35
right you've got one here you've got one
20:36
here maybe there's two or three or four
20:39
in the reading they talk about just two
20:41
but she is going to
20:43
right take or pick
20:47
or what what is she going to do what is
20:49
the elephant going to do
20:50
the elephant is going to select as she
20:52
has selected the one
20:54
with more apples in it select choose
20:58
okay number eight are you beep
21:01
that an elephant can count
21:04
so the fact that an elephant can
21:07
count that's really surprising isn't it
21:10
that's
21:11
really amazing and it might be so
21:14
surprising that
21:15
right it's like oh my gosh i can't
21:17
believe it right
21:19
it what means that what word has
21:21
something to do with something that you
21:23
find out that you discover
21:25
and it's really surprising some really
21:26
surprising information
21:28
what word has to do with that well of
21:30
course shocked
21:32
are you shocked that an elephant can
21:34
count did you know that
21:36
that's really shocking news that's
21:37
amazing news
21:39
okay well that wraps up the exercise for
21:41
the vocabulary
21:42
and we've learned a lot of different
21:44
words so now we're going to use those
21:46
we're going to see those words in a
21:48
reading passage so we're going to take a
21:49
short break come back and look at the
21:51
reading passage
