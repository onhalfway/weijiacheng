hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading i'm brian stewart
and we are studying social studies book
3
unit 7 today and unit 7 is about
the first americans in this unit we will
discover
who were the first people in america and
we'll also take a look
at a famous native american woman
so interesting lesson ahead let's get
started
with the vocabulary
okay our first vocabulary word is
history
history now some people like to make a
joke or
maybe it's you know it's a kind of an
observation i guess his
story so it's an interesting
way to look at it of course it's only
talking about men then history
but if you think about it most history
was made by men
written by men and they focused on men
but of course there are many famous
women
also in history but of course history
doesn't come from that i'm just making
it it's like a kind of like a joke or an
observation
but it doesn't it doesn't come from that
okay it's just kind of an
interesting thing to remember but
history is a story
of what happened uh a long time ago or
not not even a long time ago but what
happened in the past
in particular places the definition here
is the things that happened
in a particular place but of course we
could also
talk about you know you talk about
american history european history asian
history
korean history you know a particular
place but you could also just talk about
history in general which is world
history you know what happened on the
earth
right so uh you know at a particular
place on the earth as well too
but that's history and usually when we
talk about history
we're talking about written history so
history only goes back uh to
a time when people started writing
things down
right so written history sometimes
you'll see
people talk about written history
because when
a long time ago thousands of years ago
when people
invented writing then we could re then
we could remember things that happened a
long time ago
how did people know what happened before
reading well they told stories
but if you tell a story many times that
story changes
and it's not very reliable it's not very
accurate but when you write it down
still it's not a hundred percent
accurate but at least it's more accurate
because it doesn't change if you go to
the original source
that was written 100 years ago 500 years
ago 2000 years ago
it's still the original source it's not
100 accurate but it's more accurate than
just telling stories
for many generations now the reason i'm
saying that is because sometimes you
hear people talk
about pre-history
and basically it's an interesting word
it means before history although it's
it's not really true i mean
it still happens so it's history but
when they say prehistory
they're talking about what happened
before
people knew how to write and they call
that prehistory prehistoric so we talk
about
cave people people living in caves and
they didn't have
written records we call that prehistoric
times
so kind of interesting idea or
fact about the word history okay let's
continue
native a native is a person who has
lived in an area
since birth if you were born in korea
and you've lived in korea
since you were born you are a native
in korea if you move to china you're not
a native in china right
then you become a foreigner or uh
immigrant right uh you're not a native
in china you're a native in korea
same thing if you were born in uh if
you're born in france you were a native
of france so natives are people who live
in the certain area they're like the
original inhabitants of course when
people were
exploring and going all over the world
you know they were not natives they were
explorers they were leaving their home
country and traveling to different
countries
and they who did they meet well of
course they met natives
in those countries that they visited so
that's usually what native
means bark
what is bark it doesn't mean a sounded
dog makes although that's true
in english we say dog barks right that's
a bark but
this is a different kind of bark bark
is the tough outer covering of a tree so
you know so if you see a tree in the
forest right and you touch it
it has a hard covering that protects the
inside
uh from insects from the rain from the
weather from the sun
so that the water inside the tree
doesn't evaporate but that we call that
bark
and some trees you can peel the bark off
it's a hard covering
okay it's tough they say it's tough
tough here means
hard or strong tough is
hard or strong
so somebody who's tough is hard and
strong okay bark
canoe a canoe and we have a good picture
of a canoe
a canoe is a narrow open boat that is
moved by a paddle they're very easy to
turn they turn very quickly
and they're very easy to move because
they're small and you can just use a
paddle
another word for paddle is or but or is
a little bit different
and or an ore is kind of like you know a
long
piece of uh wood with a blade on the end
and usually have two oars and you
you move your boat like this but a
paddle is just one
one ore and we call it a paddle and it's
light
and you can do this for a very long time
to make your canoe
go through the water now american
indians were famous for using canoes
because europeans
i mean europeans had canoes but when
they came to america they saw the
indians or the natives
using canoes and so canoes became very
fixed in their minds
and associated with native americans or
indians indians native americans
buffalo now that's an interesting
picture of a buffalo
a buffalo is a kind of animal that looks
like a large cow
with horns the reason i said that this
is an interesting picture
is because this looks like the asian
type of buffalo
i think it's also called a water buffalo
water buffalo but it's not the kind of
buffalo
that we see in america oops sorry
buffalo not a
buffalo i switch those around okay
okay buffalo um yeah just look at this
don't look at my writing
okay a water buffalo or asian buffalo is
different from an american buffalo
the american buffalo again
it's kind of similar they're related but
they look different
the american buffalo is quite big it's
actually quite
dangerous and it doesn't stay in one
place buffalo in america they
roamed for hundreds of miles and they
would go
north and south following the cold and
warm temperatures
to eat the grass of course they would
move south in the winter time to get
away from the snow
and then when it got hot and too dry in
the south
in the summertime they would move back
north and the
buffalo in america oh the buffalo and
america are also called
bison bison
and the amer these were very important
animals to the native americans because
many native american tribes
in the middle of america would follow
the bison
north and south they didn't live in a
they didn't have like villages or towns
they were they were travelers they
traveled all their life and they
followed the animals because
they got food from the animals they got
they used the
animals uh hide the skin for clothing
and for shelter they made tents out of
them they used the bones
to make many different types of tools
and even
arrowheads sharp parts of the arrow that
they would shoot to kill other buffaloes
so bison were very important to
the native americans who lived in the
midwest
of america the middle of america very
wide area up and down
uh the area north and south going north
and south so look like a large cow with
horns
but they are not cows cows are kind of
peaceful
bison can be very dangerous if you go to
america and you go to a national park
like yellowstone national park
you can see many bison they also call
buffalo
be careful don't get out of your car
don't go up and try to pet them
that's very dangerous don't do that
right stay in your car
okay usually they won't bother you but
you don't want to be
out of your car if they if they run at
you
yeah that's not good okay anyway here we
have
a video and this is a video of looks
like a water buffalo this is not an
american bison this is a
this is not that type of buffalo this is
more like a it looks like more peaceful
uh more domesticated uh type of
buffalo okay that's a water buffalo okay
so yeah let's continue hide now like i
said before the bison were very
important
to the american indians because the
american indians would hunt
the bison kill them and they didn't just
eat the meat for food
they would skin take the skin of the
bison
and of course it has a lot of hair on it
fur we call fur
and it's very warm and so they would use
we call the skin and the fur together
the skin and the fur
we call that a hide right and it's just
basically the skin of an animal but it
also has
uh hair fur we call that fur f-u-r
fur is hair that grows really closely
together this is not
fur this is hair but i have a lot of
hair anyway
it's not fur um a fur would be like an
animal where it's very thick
and it's warm right so it's warm so
think about it
in the cold winter the the hides were
very good for clothing it kept helped
keep the
indians or the native americans it
helped keep them warm
in cold temperatures so it was very
important source of clothing
okay so that's our vocabulary for this
lesson
okay let's take a look at the main ideas
in this lesson the first
main idea is you know i've been talking
about native americans
and please understand that native
americans are not all the same right
there are millions and millions of
people living in america before the
europeans came to america
and they were not all the same right
there were many different
groups and each group had their own
languages their own
culture their own way of life right
there
there are many different types of lives
i told you a little bit about the the
middle of america
uh the native americans living there
they were called the plains indians but
you also had indians living on the east
coast
they didn't follow buffalo they lit they
did have villages they did have towns
right they're also uh native americans
living in the southwest
who built homes and forts and and
towns in some cases um so there are many
different types of groups and
we call those groups actually um usually
we call those
tribes now in this special case so
a tribe or tribes are native people who
are living
together in a certain area and a tribe
is a loose
organization it's not really like a
nation
or an empire or something like that it's
kind of a loose
uh more uh less developed
way of life we call that a tribe there's
a larger group of people who live
together now
the different tribes had different names
and
there there's many many different tribes
we only have room here to talk about
three so let's talk about them first of
all we have the sioux
now the sioux are an important they were
a very important tribe they were a very
large tribe that were part of the
indians or the native americans that i
talked about who
formed the plains indians they lived in
the middle
of uh of north america the sioux and
they were there were tens of
thousands of soup maybe even more
a long time ago and these are just one
of many tribes
who hunted buffalo for food clothing
homes they're the types
of native americans i told you about who
followed the bison north and south
and they hunted buffalo that was their
way of life right
they didn't settle down when a tribe
doesn't settle down
and you know take an area and farm and
stay there
when they don't do that instead they
hunt and they follow the animals
we call them nomads no mads
so the sioux were nomads it means they
traveled
they didn't stay in one spot they always
were moving
following the animals and they were
hunting buffalo
okay excuse me next we have the
pohatan pohatan and the pohatan were on
the east coast
and they were the ones that you know
when uh english or
european not just english but when
european settlers came to america
at the first time they were on the east
coast and they met uh
many tribes one of those tribes who were
there with the pohatan
and that's when they noticed oh these uh
these tribe uses canoes to go up and
down the rivers
because they were not very developed in
their culture or their society
they didn't build roads but rivers
and creeks were kind of the roads for
the native americans especially on the
east coast
where there are many rivers and how did
they move on the rivers
they used canoes so canoes was the main
form of transport early on in
american history next we have the pueblo
pueblo in fact there's a town in
colorado called pueblo pueblo colorado
named after this
group of native americans now pueblos
lived in the southwest of america south
west and oops and there were many tribes
living in the southwest the apache the
comanche the utes
well the utes were a little bit northern
but there were many tribes living the
pueblo were
relatively peaceful people another group
that's not on here
i should mention they're called the
apache
you know like i said there are many
different types of indian groups
and they had different ways of life the
apaches
were warriors they were very fierce and
they were dangerous and they
they would attack other indians and of
course
the europeans when they come into the
land the apaches were very dangerous
tribe pueblos were more peaceful right
they were more into
farming they weren't real of course they
had warriors they had to protect
themselves against the apache
and the comanche who were really really
strong warriors
of course they had warriors but they
didn't their culture wasn't about
war and fighting it was more about
farming and living off the land and the
pueblos
are very interesting because they lived
in adobe houses
and they built that some sometimes you
can find towns
you know i mentioned pueblo colorado
there is a um
a very famous site in colorado made from
adobe houses
in the cliff right in the cliffs and
adobe
adobe is a building material it's like
it's like mud
or clay you know clay is wet it's got
water in it and you can shape it
well you can take it and you can build a
house out of it right
so if you shave you can either make
bricks out of it and then cover it with
more
um clay or mud so you can't see the
bricks the bricks are in the inside
and that's what this house looks like
here but
they're they're very strong and they
last for hundreds and hundreds of years
so we can see uh remains
of towns that were built by the pueblo
and
other types of indian tribes that were
also similar to the pueblo
adobe homes villages
and towns in the american southwest that
are still
standing and you can go to them many of
them are national parks now
they're historic spots very important
places
not to be developed to be preserved
and they're made out of adobe and is a
strong material
it's very thick so inside it's cool and
in the southwest in america it's very
hot and dry
but inside of these houses even on a hot
day you could stay
cool because the walls are very thick
and they keep the inside
cool so interesting so america's history
started with native americans right
native americans many native american
groups lived in the different parts of
the u.s
long ago it's not just the u.s but all
of the americas now i'm not a very good
artist
but imagine the uh eastern end of russia
right so this is russia and this
is alaska right again i'm not a good
artist so please
please understand it's california mexico
and south america maybe
okay sorry and this is wow
yeah i'm a terrible artist this is
supposed to be florida but it's too big
anyway
this is america but
the indians actually came over from asia
tens of thousands of years ago because
it was very cold and this area was
covered
with ice so tens of thousands of years
ago
people prehistoric people came over from
asia
crossed over the ice into alaska they
must have been very tough
people and they didn't they they didn't
just go to america
they spread out right and they went
through america they went all the way
down
to the southern tip of south america and
they spread out over america
and central america although that's a
horrible map
sorry about that but you get the idea
this is where the native americans came
from and tens of thousands of years ago
actually pre-history because we don't
have any
written records of this we can only find
it out
by studying the remains of what they
left behind
so as they moved out of course they
formed many different
groups many different tribes not just
through america
not just through the u.s but all through
the americas north america
central america south america all of
these people
immigrated from asia tens of thousands
of years ago
okay and they were the first americans
okay interesting
okay so those are the different uh
tribes of america
are the americas let's take a look at
one famous native american one famous
native american
in american history and her name was
sacagawea right that's
when the first time i saw this name i
was like oh my gosh
that's how do you pronounce that but
it's saka
jawia saka juwia she was a native
american
heroine heroine is a female
hero ine means female
but she was a hero right she was a hero
she was a heroine heroine sorry heroine
because she was a female
um sacagawea was a shoshone
again another tribe the shoshone lived
northern west america now she's why is
she famous
because in 1803
1803
lewis and clark lewis and
clark they are american heroes
they are explorers and
thomas jefferson i don't know do you
know thomas jefferson he was the third
american president he bought
a big part of central america from
france
france needed the money for wars that
they were fighting and
france didn't really control the central
part of america
but they had many like little forts and
they had a lot of french traders
they had a trading network where they
would trade furs and it was very
profitable
but they kind of controlled the area of
louisiana now louisiana
is a state in america that's in the
southern part and the
and very famous city is new orleans
where the mississippi river comes
and goes into the ocean that's where new
orleans is
and new orleans has a special name it's
a french name because the french were
there first not the
english so new orleans is in louisiana
but the french controlled or they had
forts
of much not just in louisiana modern day
louisiana but all the way up all the way
to the canadian border right there's
many
states now there that are not called
louisiana but that whole
territory was called louisiana and
um thomas jefferson bought it from
france for 15 million dollars
now that maybe nowadays that doesn't
sound like a lot of money
right but in those days that was a lot
of money
15 million dollars france needed that
money to pay for their wars
and they didn't really have tight
control of the land anyway
so after thomas jefferson bought the
land he said well we need to know what
we bought
so he sent to a military former military
commanders
or officers louis and clark
to take other men and have an expedition
to go explore the land
and especially they were looking for a
water
passage to the pacific ocean there was
none
but for many hundreds of years people
thought oh if if there was a water
passage you'd be very easy to move goods
uh to the pacific ocean
so lewis and clark were looking for that
and they were exploring the louisiana
territory but in the northern part
and their mission was to go to the
pacific ocean and find the rivers
right so they used a lot of canoes but
on the way they met
saka jawia and she helped them
she was a guide for them and she knew
many of the languages so she could talk
to the different native american tribes
and you know help negotiate between them
so that you know they didn't fight
when they came across those those tribes
so she helped the explorers find food
and also talk to other native americans
and she has a special place in american
history because without her
lewis and clark would not have probably
would not have been successful
and lewis and clark are very famous
characters
in american history and many towns
and places rivers well i don't know
about rivers but many places are named
after lewis and clark or just lewis or
clark or
maybe together okay so lewis and clark
were famous explorers
in america and they were helped by
sacagawea
okay so those are the main ideas next
let's take a look at the reading passage
okay
okay let's go over the history of
america with the first americans
as usual just re read along with me or
read along in your mind to practice
pronunciation
and let's focus on the key words from
the vocabulary
are you ready let's begin the history of
america started with native americans
they were the first americans
native americans lived by using natural
resources
from the land there were many kinds of
native americans
and they showed interesting differences
powhatan people used bark to make their
canoes
and they used clay to make pots
to store water and food
sioux people lived in soft houses
made from buffalo hides while pueblo
people
lived in homes made of hard brick
called adobe that's a good picture it's
very
typical picture of south western
architecture okay
the next people to come to america
were english settlers they traded goods
with the native americans they had
complex relationships with the native
americans
and there were sometimes quarrels
between them complex relationships
means all kinds of many different kinds
of relationships
some were friendly some not so friendly
they had
quarrels between them quarrel means
small argument but sometimes it was
war and sometimes they killed each other
uh okay so there were sometimes quarrels
between them
they that's okay continue the last
arrivals to america were people from
all over the world this makes the united
states
a very special country which is true you
know there are many different types of
people from america
americans can be from all over the world
if you just move to america
you become a citizen of america you
could be from anywhere in the world
so it's kind of interesting the first
people in america were asians
coming over the ice bridge and the down
into america
then later english and european english
french
german spanish were the main groups but
other groups also came as well
and nowadays many people from all over
the world come to america
so it has a history of many different
peoples
okay well that's the reading passage
let's take a look at how the information
the reading passage is
organized okay here we have classify
classify means to separate into
different groups
so we're talking about in this case
we're talking about native americans
and we're classifying them into
different groups or
tribes right and the names of the
different tribes now of course there
were there were hundreds of different
tribes
we only have space here to talk about
three so
powhatan people uh they were the ones
that lived on the
in the eastern area and they would use
beep to make their canoes
do you remember from the reading we said
they would use
bark bark is the tough outer
covering of a tree they would use bark
to make
their canoes sioux people were the ones
who lived in
the central part of america the plains
indians part of the plains indians
suh now notice also it's interesting
sioux
looks like seahawks but it's french it's
a french word
because the french were the first people
in that area
and their spelling of this the
pronunciation of sue is
s-i-o-u-x which is not english it's
french
so that's interesting so su su people
but we pronounce it su
the sioux people they lived in soft
houses made from beep
hides what kind of hides remember the
sioux
indians were parts of the plains indians
who would chase what animals what were
the animals called they were called
buffalo or bison buffalo
buffalo were very important to them and
they would use
their materials for food tools and
clothing and also to make tents soft
houses
tents pueblo people pueblo people
southwestern
america arizona nowaday arizona new
mexico colorado
utah um pueblo people lived in homes
made of
what it's called adobe made of hard
bricks
hard bricks oops that's two words
okay so there's a space here
hard and that's a d hard bricks so
pueblo people lived in homes made of
hard bricks called
adobe and that's a very uh distinct
it's very recognizable type of
architecture we saw a good picture of
that
if you go to new mexico santa fe has a
lot of adobe houses
colorado has a lot of old adobe houses
made by
pueblo indians and other indian tribes
okay well that's an interesting article
interesting lesson
about the different native american
groups living in america
but remember it wasn't just united
states also
canada and also central america and
southern america
there are many many different types of
native americans
okay interesting lesson hope you learned
a lot that's it for today
take care everybody see you in the next
one

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:11
textbook reading i'm brian stewart
00:13
and we are studying social studies book
00:15
3
00:16
unit 7 today and unit 7 is about
00:20
the first americans in this unit we will
00:23
discover
00:24
who were the first people in america and
00:26
we'll also take a look
00:28
at a famous native american woman
00:31
so interesting lesson ahead let's get
00:34
started
00:34
with the vocabulary
00:38
okay our first vocabulary word is
00:40
history
00:42
history now some people like to make a
00:44
joke or
00:45
maybe it's you know it's a kind of an
00:46
observation i guess his
00:49
story so it's an interesting
00:53
way to look at it of course it's only
00:55
talking about men then history
00:57
but if you think about it most history
00:59
was made by men
01:00
written by men and they focused on men
01:03
but of course there are many famous
01:05
women
01:05
also in history but of course history
01:08
doesn't come from that i'm just making
01:09
it it's like a kind of like a joke or an
01:11
observation
01:13
but it doesn't it doesn't come from that
01:15
okay it's just kind of an
01:17
interesting thing to remember but
01:18
history is a story
01:20
of what happened uh a long time ago or
01:25
not not even a long time ago but what
01:26
happened in the past
01:28
in particular places the definition here
01:30
is the things that happened
01:32
in a particular place but of course we
01:35
could also
01:35
talk about you know you talk about
01:37
american history european history asian
01:40
history
01:40
korean history you know a particular
01:43
place but you could also just talk about
01:45
history in general which is world
01:48
history you know what happened on the
01:50
earth
01:50
right so uh you know at a particular
01:53
place on the earth as well too
01:54
but that's history and usually when we
01:56
talk about history
01:58
we're talking about written history so
02:01
history only goes back uh to
02:05
a time when people started writing
02:07
things down
02:08
right so written history sometimes
02:11
you'll see
02:12
people talk about written history
02:14
because when
02:16
a long time ago thousands of years ago
02:18
when people
02:19
invented writing then we could re then
02:22
we could remember things that happened a
02:24
long time ago
02:26
how did people know what happened before
02:29
reading well they told stories
02:30
but if you tell a story many times that
02:33
story changes
02:34
and it's not very reliable it's not very
02:37
accurate but when you write it down
02:39
still it's not a hundred percent
02:41
accurate but at least it's more accurate
02:43
because it doesn't change if you go to
02:45
the original source
02:46
that was written 100 years ago 500 years
02:49
ago 2000 years ago
02:51
it's still the original source it's not
02:54
100 accurate but it's more accurate than
02:56
just telling stories
02:57
for many generations now the reason i'm
03:00
saying that is because sometimes you
03:03
hear people talk
03:04
about pre-history
03:07
and basically it's an interesting word
03:10
it means before history although it's
03:13
it's not really true i mean
03:15
it still happens so it's history but
03:16
when they say prehistory
03:18
they're talking about what happened
03:20
before
03:22
people knew how to write and they call
03:24
that prehistory prehistoric so we talk
03:26
about
03:27
cave people people living in caves and
03:30
they didn't have
03:31
written records we call that prehistoric
03:34
times
03:34
so kind of interesting idea or
03:38
fact about the word history okay let's
03:42
continue
03:43
native a native is a person who has
03:46
lived in an area
03:47
since birth if you were born in korea
03:50
and you've lived in korea
03:52
since you were born you are a native
03:55
in korea if you move to china you're not
03:58
a native in china right
04:00
then you become a foreigner or uh
04:03
immigrant right uh you're not a native
04:05
in china you're a native in korea
04:07
same thing if you were born in uh if
04:09
you're born in france you were a native
04:11
of france so natives are people who live
04:14
in the certain area they're like the
04:16
original inhabitants of course when
04:19
people were
04:19
exploring and going all over the world
04:22
you know they were not natives they were
04:24
explorers they were leaving their home
04:26
country and traveling to different
04:27
countries
04:28
and they who did they meet well of
04:30
course they met natives
04:31
in those countries that they visited so
04:34
that's usually what native
04:35
means bark
04:39
what is bark it doesn't mean a sounded
04:41
dog makes although that's true
04:44
in english we say dog barks right that's
04:47
a bark but
04:48
this is a different kind of bark bark
04:51
is the tough outer covering of a tree so
04:55
you know so if you see a tree in the
04:56
forest right and you touch it
04:58
it has a hard covering that protects the
05:01
inside
05:02
uh from insects from the rain from the
05:04
weather from the sun
05:05
so that the water inside the tree
05:07
doesn't evaporate but that we call that
05:09
bark
05:10
and some trees you can peel the bark off
05:12
it's a hard covering
05:14
okay it's tough they say it's tough
05:16
tough here means
05:17
hard or strong tough is
05:20
hard or strong
05:25
so somebody who's tough is hard and
05:27
strong okay bark
05:30
canoe a canoe and we have a good picture
05:33
of a canoe
05:33
a canoe is a narrow open boat that is
05:36
moved by a paddle they're very easy to
05:38
turn they turn very quickly
05:40
and they're very easy to move because
05:42
they're small and you can just use a
05:44
paddle
05:45
another word for paddle is or but or is
05:48
a little bit different
05:49
and or an ore is kind of like you know a
05:52
long
05:53
piece of uh wood with a blade on the end
05:56
and usually have two oars and you
05:58
you move your boat like this but a
05:59
paddle is just one
06:01
one ore and we call it a paddle and it's
06:04
light
06:04
and you can do this for a very long time
06:07
to make your canoe
06:09
go through the water now american
06:11
indians were famous for using canoes
06:13
because europeans
06:14
i mean europeans had canoes but when
06:17
they came to america they saw the
06:19
indians or the natives
06:20
using canoes and so canoes became very
06:24
fixed in their minds
06:25
and associated with native americans or
06:29
indians indians native americans
06:32
buffalo now that's an interesting
06:34
picture of a buffalo
06:36
a buffalo is a kind of animal that looks
06:38
like a large cow
06:40
with horns the reason i said that this
06:42
is an interesting picture
06:43
is because this looks like the asian
06:45
type of buffalo
06:47
i think it's also called a water buffalo
06:50
water buffalo but it's not the kind of
06:52
buffalo
06:54
that we see in america oops sorry
06:56
buffalo not a
06:57
buffalo i switch those around okay
07:01
okay buffalo um yeah just look at this
07:04
don't look at my writing
07:06
okay a water buffalo or asian buffalo is
07:09
different from an american buffalo
07:11
the american buffalo again
07:14
it's kind of similar they're related but
07:16
they look different
07:17
the american buffalo is quite big it's
07:20
actually quite
07:21
dangerous and it doesn't stay in one
07:24
place buffalo in america they
07:28
roamed for hundreds of miles and they
07:30
would go
07:31
north and south following the cold and
07:34
warm temperatures
07:35
to eat the grass of course they would
07:37
move south in the winter time to get
07:39
away from the snow
07:40
and then when it got hot and too dry in
07:42
the south
07:43
in the summertime they would move back
07:45
north and the
07:47
buffalo in america oh the buffalo and
07:49
america are also called
07:50
bison bison
07:53
and the amer these were very important
07:55
animals to the native americans because
07:58
many native american tribes
08:00
in the middle of america would follow
08:02
the bison
08:03
north and south they didn't live in a
08:06
they didn't have like villages or towns
08:08
they were they were travelers they
08:10
traveled all their life and they
08:11
followed the animals because
08:12
they got food from the animals they got
08:15
they used the
08:16
animals uh hide the skin for clothing
08:19
and for shelter they made tents out of
08:22
them they used the bones
08:23
to make many different types of tools
08:25
and even
08:28
arrowheads sharp parts of the arrow that
08:31
they would shoot to kill other buffaloes
08:33
so bison were very important to
08:36
the native americans who lived in the
08:39
midwest
08:40
of america the middle of america very
08:42
wide area up and down
08:44
uh the area north and south going north
08:47
and south so look like a large cow with
08:49
horns
08:50
but they are not cows cows are kind of
08:52
peaceful
08:54
bison can be very dangerous if you go to
08:56
america and you go to a national park
08:58
like yellowstone national park
09:00
you can see many bison they also call
09:02
buffalo
09:03
be careful don't get out of your car
09:05
don't go up and try to pet them
09:07
that's very dangerous don't do that
09:09
right stay in your car
09:11
okay usually they won't bother you but
09:13
you don't want to be
09:15
out of your car if they if they run at
09:18
you
09:18
yeah that's not good okay anyway here we
09:21
have
09:22
a video and this is a video of looks
09:24
like a water buffalo this is not an
09:26
american bison this is a
09:28
this is not that type of buffalo this is
09:30
more like a it looks like more peaceful
09:32
uh more domesticated uh type of
09:36
buffalo okay that's a water buffalo okay
09:39
so yeah let's continue hide now like i
09:42
said before the bison were very
09:44
important
09:45
to the american indians because the
09:47
american indians would hunt
09:48
the bison kill them and they didn't just
09:51
eat the meat for food
09:52
they would skin take the skin of the
09:55
bison
09:55
and of course it has a lot of hair on it
09:58
fur we call fur
09:59
and it's very warm and so they would use
10:02
we call the skin and the fur together
10:05
the skin and the fur
10:06
we call that a hide right and it's just
10:09
basically the skin of an animal but it
10:11
also has
10:12
uh hair fur we call that fur f-u-r
10:16
fur is hair that grows really closely
10:18
together this is not
10:19
fur this is hair but i have a lot of
10:21
hair anyway
10:23
it's not fur um a fur would be like an
10:26
animal where it's very thick
10:27
and it's warm right so it's warm so
10:29
think about it
10:30
in the cold winter the the hides were
10:33
very good for clothing it kept helped
10:35
keep the
10:36
indians or the native americans it
10:37
helped keep them warm
10:39
in cold temperatures so it was very
10:41
important source of clothing
10:44
okay so that's our vocabulary for this
10:46
lesson
10:52
okay let's take a look at the main ideas
10:54
in this lesson the first
10:55
main idea is you know i've been talking
10:57
about native americans
10:59
and please understand that native
11:02
americans are not all the same right
11:05
there are millions and millions of
11:06
people living in america before the
11:08
europeans came to america
11:10
and they were not all the same right
11:12
there were many different
11:14
groups and each group had their own
11:16
languages their own
11:17
culture their own way of life right
11:20
there
11:20
there are many different types of lives
11:22
i told you a little bit about the the
11:23
middle of america
11:25
uh the native americans living there
11:27
they were called the plains indians but
11:29
you also had indians living on the east
11:31
coast
11:31
they didn't follow buffalo they lit they
11:33
did have villages they did have towns
11:36
right they're also uh native americans
11:38
living in the southwest
11:40
who built homes and forts and and
11:43
towns in some cases um so there are many
11:46
different types of groups and
11:47
we call those groups actually um usually
11:50
we call those
11:52
tribes now in this special case so
11:56
a tribe or tribes are native people who
11:59
are living
12:00
together in a certain area and a tribe
12:02
is a loose
12:03
organization it's not really like a
12:05
nation
12:07
or an empire or something like that it's
12:10
kind of a loose
12:12
uh more uh less developed
12:16
way of life we call that a tribe there's
12:18
a larger group of people who live
12:20
together now
12:21
the different tribes had different names
12:24
and
12:24
there there's many many different tribes
12:27
we only have room here to talk about
12:29
three so let's talk about them first of
12:31
all we have the sioux
12:32
now the sioux are an important they were
12:34
a very important tribe they were a very
12:36
large tribe that were part of the
12:39
indians or the native americans that i
12:41
talked about who
12:42
formed the plains indians they lived in
12:45
the middle
12:46
of uh of north america the sioux and
12:49
they were there were tens of
12:50
thousands of soup maybe even more
12:54
a long time ago and these are just one
12:57
of many tribes
12:58
who hunted buffalo for food clothing
13:00
homes they're the types
13:02
of native americans i told you about who
13:04
followed the bison north and south
13:06
and they hunted buffalo that was their
13:08
way of life right
13:10
they didn't settle down when a tribe
13:12
doesn't settle down
13:13
and you know take an area and farm and
13:16
stay there
13:17
when they don't do that instead they
13:19
hunt and they follow the animals
13:21
we call them nomads no mads
13:25
so the sioux were nomads it means they
13:27
traveled
13:28
they didn't stay in one spot they always
13:30
were moving
13:31
following the animals and they were
13:34
hunting buffalo
13:35
okay excuse me next we have the
13:39
pohatan pohatan and the pohatan were on
13:42
the east coast
13:43
and they were the ones that you know
13:45
when uh english or
13:47
european not just english but when
13:48
european settlers came to america
13:51
at the first time they were on the east
13:52
coast and they met uh
13:54
many tribes one of those tribes who were
13:56
there with the pohatan
13:57
and that's when they noticed oh these uh
14:00
these tribe uses canoes to go up and
14:02
down the rivers
14:04
because they were not very developed in
14:07
their culture or their society
14:08
they didn't build roads but rivers
14:12
and creeks were kind of the roads for
14:15
the native americans especially on the
14:16
east coast
14:17
where there are many rivers and how did
14:20
they move on the rivers
14:21
they used canoes so canoes was the main
14:24
form of transport early on in
14:27
american history next we have the pueblo
14:32
pueblo in fact there's a town in
14:34
colorado called pueblo pueblo colorado
14:37
named after this
14:38
group of native americans now pueblos
14:42
lived in the southwest of america south
14:46
west and oops and there were many tribes
14:49
living in the southwest the apache the
14:51
comanche the utes
14:53
well the utes were a little bit northern
14:55
but there were many tribes living the
14:57
pueblo were
14:58
relatively peaceful people another group
15:00
that's not on here
15:01
i should mention they're called the
15:03
apache
15:05
you know like i said there are many
15:06
different types of indian groups
15:08
and they had different ways of life the
15:10
apaches
15:12
were warriors they were very fierce and
15:14
they were dangerous and they
15:15
they would attack other indians and of
15:18
course
15:18
the europeans when they come into the
15:20
land the apaches were very dangerous
15:22
tribe pueblos were more peaceful right
15:25
they were more into
15:26
farming they weren't real of course they
15:28
had warriors they had to protect
15:29
themselves against the apache
15:31
and the comanche who were really really
15:33
strong warriors
15:34
of course they had warriors but they
15:36
didn't their culture wasn't about
15:39
war and fighting it was more about
15:42
farming and living off the land and the
15:44
pueblos
15:45
are very interesting because they lived
15:48
in adobe houses
15:50
and they built that some sometimes you
15:51
can find towns
15:53
you know i mentioned pueblo colorado
15:55
there is a um
15:57
a very famous site in colorado made from
16:00
adobe houses
16:01
in the cliff right in the cliffs and
16:03
adobe
16:04
adobe is a building material it's like
16:07
it's like mud
16:08
or clay you know clay is wet it's got
16:10
water in it and you can shape it
16:12
well you can take it and you can build a
16:14
house out of it right
16:16
so if you shave you can either make
16:17
bricks out of it and then cover it with
16:19
more
16:20
um clay or mud so you can't see the
16:23
bricks the bricks are in the inside
16:24
and that's what this house looks like
16:26
here but
16:28
they're they're very strong and they
16:30
last for hundreds and hundreds of years
16:33
so we can see uh remains
16:36
of towns that were built by the pueblo
16:39
and
16:39
other types of indian tribes that were
16:41
also similar to the pueblo
16:43
adobe homes villages
16:46
and towns in the american southwest that
16:49
are still
16:50
standing and you can go to them many of
16:51
them are national parks now
16:53
they're historic spots very important
16:55
places
16:57
not to be developed to be preserved
17:00
and they're made out of adobe and is a
17:03
strong material
17:04
it's very thick so inside it's cool and
17:07
in the southwest in america it's very
17:09
hot and dry
17:10
but inside of these houses even on a hot
17:13
day you could stay
17:14
cool because the walls are very thick
17:16
and they keep the inside
17:17
cool so interesting so america's history
17:21
started with native americans right
17:24
native americans many native american
17:26
groups lived in the different parts of
17:28
the u.s
17:29
long ago it's not just the u.s but all
17:31
of the americas now i'm not a very good
17:33
artist
17:34
but imagine the uh eastern end of russia
17:38
right so this is russia and this
17:41
is alaska right again i'm not a good
17:44
artist so please
17:46
please understand it's california mexico
17:50
and south america maybe
17:53
okay sorry and this is wow
17:57
yeah i'm a terrible artist this is
17:59
supposed to be florida but it's too big
18:00
anyway
18:02
this is america but
18:05
the indians actually came over from asia
18:08
tens of thousands of years ago because
18:11
it was very cold and this area was
18:13
covered
18:14
with ice so tens of thousands of years
18:18
ago
18:18
people prehistoric people came over from
18:22
asia
18:23
crossed over the ice into alaska they
18:25
must have been very tough
18:26
people and they didn't they they didn't
18:29
just go to america
18:30
they spread out right and they went
18:32
through america they went all the way
18:33
down
18:34
to the southern tip of south america and
18:36
they spread out over america
18:38
and central america although that's a
18:40
horrible map
18:41
sorry about that but you get the idea
18:44
this is where the native americans came
18:46
from and tens of thousands of years ago
18:48
actually pre-history because we don't
18:50
have any
18:50
written records of this we can only find
18:53
it out
18:53
by studying the remains of what they
18:55
left behind
18:57
so as they moved out of course they
18:59
formed many different
19:00
groups many different tribes not just
19:02
through america
19:04
not just through the u.s but all through
19:06
the americas north america
19:08
central america south america all of
19:11
these people
19:12
immigrated from asia tens of thousands
19:15
of years ago
19:17
okay and they were the first americans
19:19
okay interesting
19:20
okay so those are the different uh
19:22
tribes of america
19:24
are the americas let's take a look at
19:26
one famous native american one famous
19:28
native american
19:29
in american history and her name was
19:33
sacagawea right that's
19:36
when the first time i saw this name i
19:38
was like oh my gosh
19:39
that's how do you pronounce that but
19:41
it's saka
19:42
jawia saka juwia she was a native
19:45
american
19:46
heroine heroine is a female
19:49
hero ine means female
19:53
but she was a hero right she was a hero
19:56
she was a heroine heroine sorry heroine
19:59
because she was a female
20:00
um sacagawea was a shoshone
20:03
again another tribe the shoshone lived
20:07
northern west america now she's why is
20:10
she famous
20:11
because in 1803
20:17
1803
20:19
lewis and clark lewis and
20:22
clark they are american heroes
20:26
they are explorers and
20:30
thomas jefferson i don't know do you
20:32
know thomas jefferson he was the third
20:34
american president he bought
20:37
a big part of central america from
20:40
france
20:41
france needed the money for wars that
20:43
they were fighting and
20:44
france didn't really control the central
20:47
part of america
20:48
but they had many like little forts and
20:50
they had a lot of french traders
20:51
they had a trading network where they
20:53
would trade furs and it was very
20:55
profitable
20:55
but they kind of controlled the area of
20:58
louisiana now louisiana
21:00
is a state in america that's in the
21:01
southern part and the
21:03
and very famous city is new orleans
21:05
where the mississippi river comes
21:07
and goes into the ocean that's where new
21:09
orleans is
21:10
and new orleans has a special name it's
21:12
a french name because the french were
21:14
there first not the
21:16
english so new orleans is in louisiana
21:20
but the french controlled or they had
21:22
forts
21:23
of much not just in louisiana modern day
21:26
louisiana but all the way up all the way
21:28
to the canadian border right there's
21:29
many
21:30
states now there that are not called
21:31
louisiana but that whole
21:33
territory was called louisiana and
21:36
um thomas jefferson bought it from
21:38
france for 15 million dollars
21:41
now that maybe nowadays that doesn't
21:43
sound like a lot of money
21:45
right but in those days that was a lot
21:49
of money
21:49
15 million dollars france needed that
21:51
money to pay for their wars
21:53
and they didn't really have tight
21:55
control of the land anyway
21:57
so after thomas jefferson bought the
21:59
land he said well we need to know what
22:01
we bought
22:02
so he sent to a military former military
22:06
commanders
22:07
or officers louis and clark
22:10
to take other men and have an expedition
22:13
to go explore the land
22:15
and especially they were looking for a
22:18
water
22:18
passage to the pacific ocean there was
22:21
none
22:22
but for many hundreds of years people
22:24
thought oh if if there was a water
22:26
passage you'd be very easy to move goods
22:28
uh to the pacific ocean
22:30
so lewis and clark were looking for that
22:32
and they were exploring the louisiana
22:33
territory but in the northern part
22:35
and their mission was to go to the
22:37
pacific ocean and find the rivers
22:40
right so they used a lot of canoes but
22:42
on the way they met
22:43
saka jawia and she helped them
22:47
she was a guide for them and she knew
22:49
many of the languages so she could talk
22:51
to the different native american tribes
22:55
and you know help negotiate between them
22:58
so that you know they didn't fight
23:00
when they came across those those tribes
23:03
so she helped the explorers find food
23:05
and also talk to other native americans
23:08
and she has a special place in american
23:10
history because without her
23:12
lewis and clark would not have probably
23:14
would not have been successful
23:16
and lewis and clark are very famous
23:18
characters
23:19
in american history and many towns
23:23
and places rivers well i don't know
23:25
about rivers but many places are named
23:27
after lewis and clark or just lewis or
23:31
clark or
23:31
maybe together okay so lewis and clark
23:34
were famous explorers
23:35
in america and they were helped by
23:37
sacagawea
23:39
okay so those are the main ideas next
23:41
let's take a look at the reading passage
23:43
okay
23:46
okay let's go over the history of
23:48
america with the first americans
23:50
as usual just re read along with me or
23:53
read along in your mind to practice
23:55
pronunciation
23:56
and let's focus on the key words from
23:58
the vocabulary
23:59
are you ready let's begin the history of
24:03
america started with native americans
24:07
they were the first americans
24:11
native americans lived by using natural
24:14
resources
24:14
from the land there were many kinds of
24:19
native americans
24:20
and they showed interesting differences
24:24
powhatan people used bark to make their
24:28
canoes
24:29
and they used clay to make pots
24:32
to store water and food
24:37
sioux people lived in soft houses
24:40
made from buffalo hides while pueblo
24:44
people
24:45
lived in homes made of hard brick
24:48
called adobe that's a good picture it's
24:52
very
24:52
typical picture of south western
24:56
architecture okay
24:59
the next people to come to america
25:02
were english settlers they traded goods
25:06
with the native americans they had
25:10
complex relationships with the native
25:13
americans
25:14
and there were sometimes quarrels
25:17
between them complex relationships
25:21
means all kinds of many different kinds
25:23
of relationships
25:25
some were friendly some not so friendly
25:27
they had
25:28
quarrels between them quarrel means
25:31
small argument but sometimes it was
25:33
war and sometimes they killed each other
25:37
uh okay so there were sometimes quarrels
25:39
between them
25:40
they that's okay continue the last
25:43
arrivals to america were people from
25:46
all over the world this makes the united
25:48
states
25:49
a very special country which is true you
25:52
know there are many different types of
25:54
people from america
25:56
americans can be from all over the world
25:58
if you just move to america
26:00
you become a citizen of america you
26:02
could be from anywhere in the world
26:04
so it's kind of interesting the first
26:05
people in america were asians
26:08
coming over the ice bridge and the down
26:10
into america
26:11
then later english and european english
26:14
french
26:15
german spanish were the main groups but
26:18
other groups also came as well
26:19
and nowadays many people from all over
26:22
the world come to america
26:24
so it has a history of many different
26:26
peoples
26:27
okay well that's the reading passage
26:29
let's take a look at how the information
26:31
the reading passage is
26:32
organized okay here we have classify
26:36
classify means to separate into
26:38
different groups
26:39
so we're talking about in this case
26:41
we're talking about native americans
26:43
and we're classifying them into
26:45
different groups or
26:46
tribes right and the names of the
26:48
different tribes now of course there
26:50
were there were hundreds of different
26:51
tribes
26:52
we only have space here to talk about
26:54
three so
26:55
powhatan people uh they were the ones
26:58
that lived on the
26:59
in the eastern area and they would use
27:02
beep to make their canoes
27:03
do you remember from the reading we said
27:05
they would use
27:07
bark bark is the tough outer
27:10
covering of a tree they would use bark
27:12
to make
27:13
their canoes sioux people were the ones
27:16
who lived in
27:18
the central part of america the plains
27:21
indians part of the plains indians
27:23
suh now notice also it's interesting
27:26
sioux
27:26
looks like seahawks but it's french it's
27:29
a french word
27:30
because the french were the first people
27:32
in that area
27:33
and their spelling of this the
27:35
pronunciation of sue is
27:37
s-i-o-u-x which is not english it's
27:39
french
27:40
so that's interesting so su su people
27:42
but we pronounce it su
27:43
the sioux people they lived in soft
27:46
houses made from beep
27:48
hides what kind of hides remember the
