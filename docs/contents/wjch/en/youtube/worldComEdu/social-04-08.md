hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
my name is brian stewart and in this
lesson we're looking at social science
book
4 lesson 8 the end of slavery
in this unit or in this lesson you will
discover
how american slavery was ended
and who some african-american heroes
are so let's get started our first word
for this lesson is slavery slavery is
the condition
of being a slave what is a slave we'll
see that that's
a word coming up soon
next we have plantation a plantation is
a large
farm where people grow crops
and plantations were usually in the
southern
part of america where the temperature
the climate was very warm
and it was good for growing many
different types of crops
especially cotton so a plantation is
like a very
big farm
next we have slave as i as i said we
have that word coming up
we saw slavery before is the condition
of being a slave but
what is a slave a slave is a person
who is owned by another person
and works for that person without
payment
unfortunately for thousands of years
human beings have treated other human
beings as
slaves and we can see this in many
historical
periods and in many parts of the world
and that's basically slavery when you
own another person usually people would
fight wars
and the losers you know if they weren't
killed they were taken as slaves
and forced to work for no money
now a servant is someone who works in
another person's home
and usually when we think of servants
servants are
paid for their work for example a
housemaid
or a butler usually of course these days
obviously
servants are paid for their work so
there are still servants
around today and of course servants have
been around again for thousands of years
as well
but usually servants would receive money
or
some kind of compensation for working in
usually
a rich person's house
escape escape means to get away from
something
to run away from something to leave
a situation that is dangerous or
unpleasant
maybe you want to escape from your
homework yeah but
homework's it's important to do your
homework so don't escape
okay do your homework and then you can
escape and have fun with your friends
okay good so that's escape
civil war now many countries have had
many different
wars the civil war is a war in america
that occurred between 1861 to 1865
and it was a war between the southern
states
and the northern states of america as
you know
we talked about in a previous lesson
america has many different
states and in the northern part of
america and the southern part of america
there are many states now a civil war
it doesn't matter what country you know
other countries have also had
civil wars it's when one part of the
country
decides they don't want to be part of
the bigger country they want to
break away and make their own country
and so
we call that situation a civil war when
fighting breaks out over that issue
that would be a civil war okay and in
this case
when we when americans talk about the
civil war they're talking about the war
between southern
states and northern states okay
cotton i mentioned this before when i
talked about
plantations cotton is a kind of plant
that produces white soft hairs
used to make clothes so obviously this
is a very
important crop or plant and this is the
white
cotton ball right i don't know
if you're probably too young
to know this but people used to use they
still do use cotton
balls sometimes for medicine right if
you have a a
a wound a scar your mom might take a
cotton
cotton ball put it in some alcohol or
some
disinfectant and brush your hand with it
to
help disinfect your cut
but cotton was also pulled apart and
used to make
thread in clothes and this of course was
very important
in making clothes which is a very
important industry
in the 1800s and is still an important
industry today
so it was a very important crop and it
was usually grown
in the southern states why again because
they had a lot of
wide open land and the climate was very
warm
good for growing plants okay
sugar cane sugar cane was also another
and
still is a very important crop of course
it's a kind of plant that produces
sweet crystal-like material used for
cooking
sweet crystal-like material used for
cooking
that's sugar okay so when you want to
put a little bit of sugar right
on your uh on your cereal well don't put
sugar on your cereal already has
too much sugar but anyways many foods
they put
sugar into it and they get sugar from
sugar cane did you know that
these plants they look like bamboo don't
they but
they can dry them they can process these
plants and make
sugar out of these plants so again sugar
was
another very important crop like cotton
that is grown in southern states and
also in many
small islands in the caribbean okay
those are our words for this lesson
now one of the main ideas of this unit
of course is the
end of slavery and we're talking about
slavery
in america which unfortunately slavery
like i said slavery
was practiced for thousands of years in
many countries around the world
unfortunately in america was one of the
last
countries to get rid of slavery in the
1860s
so how did this happen what was the
timeline of slavery in america and when
did it
end well a long time ago africans were
taken from their homes
and sold as slaves in some parts of
america
usually the southern states because why
in the southern states
because like i said there were many
plantations
and the farmers there grew cotton they
also grew sugar cane
also again in many caribbean nations
like haiti
and costa rica and in cuba
they had these very large fields where
they grew cotton and sugar cane
and they needed cheap labor they needed
people to work in these farms
and of course africa from africa there
was a slave trade
and so many slaves were shipped over to
the americas
during the 1600s 1700s
and of course in the 1800s to work
on these farms and it was a horrible
terrible thing that happened
but that's what happened now when slaves
came to the new world
which was what america and that area was
called
slaves worked as laborers in the fields
so they worked as laborers in the fields
or as
house servants a laborer
is just somebody who works works hard
and they do very
physical jobs like digging or raking or
picking crops in the fields it's very
hot it's
terrible dirty and very difficult
physically demanding work or as house
servants
working in the house uh serving the
the masters of the plantation the rich
people who owned
the farms or the plantations so
slavery was one of the reasons for the
war
called the civil war slavery was one of
the reasons there were other economical
economic reasons as well slavery
and also some issues of independence
that the southern states had
disagreements
with the north and there were some
tensions but slavery was one of the main
issues for the civil war the south
wanted to keep the southern states
wanted to keep
slavery as an institution many northern
states
didn't have slavery they didn't need it
they were
manufacturing they had factories they
didn't have farms
they didn't need that many people
working in the fields in the north
so the north didn't really have slavery
and in fact slavery was outlawed it was
not
allowed it was not permitted but it was
allowed in the south
and this was a major source of tension
between the northern states
and the southern states and of course
these tensions one of one of the main
tensions
these tensions became very large
and the south decided we're leaving the
the united states of america we're going
to make our own country
the southern states lost the war and
they were they stayed
inside uh the united states and after
the war
president abraham lincoln ended slavery
after after the north won the war
and uh president abraham lincoln signed
a
a bill or a law it was called the
emancipation proclamation
emancipation proclamation and it was
basically
a decree or a statement that nobody can
own
another person slavery was outlawed
throughout
america and that was the emancipation
proclamation
okay there are some african-american
heroes that we can talk about
harriet tubman is one of them she was a
slave so she lived
back in the 1800s and she escaped to
freedom so she was in the south
she was a slave in the south she escaped
to the north where slaves were free
there were no slaves
and uh there was you know slavery was
not allowed so she escaped to the north
to her freedom and she didn't just rest
and uh carry on her life and enjoy you
know being a free person
she felt a responsibility
and obligation to help the other people
like her
that that she had left when she escaped
to the north
so she was very brave she didn't have to
do this but she volunteered to help
hundreds
of other slaves escape she is remembered
for her courage
and in fact she's very famous for
helping with the
what's called the underground railroad
it wasn't actually underground people
sometimes say something is underground
when it's hidden from sight or it's
illegal they don't see it
and so it's kind of hidden the
underground railroad it wasn't a
railroad
that went under the ground no it but it
was hidden from sight
so that the authorities the law
enforcement in the south
couldn't see them couldn't find them but
it was a railroad because it helped many
people go from south
to the north slaves to escape to their
freedom in the north and she was very
important
for this movement now even though
slavery ended
hundreds a hundred years later there
were still
problems in america especially with race
and they still continue to this day of
course
there's another famous person jackie
robinson who in the 1950s
he became the first african-american
player in major league baseball major
league baseball the
mlb and he played for the dodgers as you
can see
on his uniform so although slavery was
ended there was no more slavery
in the 1950s african
americans were not treated equally
they were there was discrimination right
so
they were not treated as an equal person
now jackie robinson became very famous
because he was the first
african-american player
to be accepted by the dodgers you may
know the dodgers as a very
famous american baseball team you think
oh the la dodgers
yes they're in los angeles now but they
used to be in new york
sometimes teams will change cities
because people will buy the team
and move it to another city but in the
1950s the dodgers were in new york
and they hired or they recruited
jackie robinson to play for the team now
there's a really good movie
that i recommend to you it's called 42
and it's a recent movie and it's it
tells a story about jackie robinson
it really shows the discrimination
and the controversy of this story it's a
very good movie so
if you have time check it out okay so
anyway let's move on
let's do the reading now as usual i will
read out loud
you guys repeat after me or repeat in
your minds let's focus
on the words from the vocabulary
not all people in the early united
states
were free in some parts of america
people taken from africa had to work
in slavery workers on plantations
worked long hard days
as slaves
slaves had to pick cotton in the fields
or raise crops like sugar cane
other slaves worked in the homes of
slave owners
as servants the life
of a slave was hard and many slaves
tried to escape
to freedom in the north
unlike the southern states of america
the
northern states did not support slavery
president abraham lincoln decided that
slavery should end the southern states
challenged the president's decision
as a result the northern and southern
states
fought the long and terrible civil war
over the issue of slavery
in the end the north won and the slaves
were set
free
okay let's take a look at how this
reading passage was organized and here
we have
sequence sequence is like an order of
events
what happens first what happens next and
then what happens in the end
and this reading passage is kind of
organized along the lines
because we're talking about slavery what
was the beginning of slavery
what were the effects and how did it end
and that's what these three boxes
will tell us so first of all we have
people taken from
africa had to work in
what word from the vocabulary can we use
here had to work in what
now you don't say in plantations you
could say implantations
but on plantations would be the
preposition
they had to work on plantations so you
have to work on
farms but in this case we're talking
about a condition
what condition was from the vocabulary
the condition was
slavery slavery
so we use in when we describe a
condition
in which someone has to work they had to
work in slavery
they had to work in bondage they had to
work
in some sort of condition but if you're
talking about where they worked
if you're talking about farms or ranches
or plantations
we use on they worked on farms they
worked on ranches
they worked on plantations and that's
what we have next
slaves had to work on plantations i just
said it
plantations
or in homes as what do you remember
people who work in the homes of
slave owners or rich people servants
servants so
up there make my tea there okay or in
homes as
servants the life of a slave was hard
and many slaves of course tried to
beep to freedom right they try to run
away what's another word for runaway
escape escape
escape to freedom president lincoln
decided to
end slavery okay so the first box tells
us
the condition uh you know where people
came from
the middle box kind of describes what
the situation was after
so many years and the last box we'll
talk about the
end of slavery so the northern and
southern states fought a war called
what was the war called between the
south and the north
it was called the civil war
the civil
war now here i'd like to point out that
you need to use
the because it's a war when we talk
about wars
we and we say what kind of war it is we
say the war because
unfortunately there are many wars in the
world
so when we describe a particular or
unique war
we name it and we have to use the
because we're saying which
war it's a war which war the
civil war it's a revolution
which revolution the french revolution
so when we talk about events like this
of course there are many
type similar type events and we name it
use
the okay so the civil war the french
revolution
the war of 1812 so we need to use the
okay the north won and slaves were set
free abraham lincoln issued the
emancipation proclamation okay so
uh in this lesson we took a look at the
end of slavery it was a terrible period
for american history it's a shameful uh
period for american history should have
never happened
but it did and that's history and
there's a lot of things that
that we can see in history where we hope
and we
we have to work so that they never
happen again we should not forget them
okay so anyway i hope that you learned a
lot in the vocabulary for this lesson
and it was kind of an interesting look
into the past into the history
okay thanks for standing with me as
always and we'll see you again
in the next lesson take care everybody
bye-bye

00:23
discover
00:23
how american slavery was ended
00:26
and who some african-american heroes
00:30
are so let's get started our first word
00:34
for this lesson is slavery slavery is
00:37
the condition
00:38
of being a slave what is a slave we'll
00:41
see that that's
00:42
a word coming up soon
00:46
next we have plantation a plantation is
00:49
a large
00:50
farm where people grow crops
00:53
and plantations were usually in the
00:55
southern
00:56
part of america where the temperature
00:59
the climate was very warm
01:01
and it was good for growing many
01:02
different types of crops
01:04
especially cotton so a plantation is
01:07
like a very
01:08
big farm
01:12
next we have slave as i as i said we
01:15
have that word coming up
01:16
we saw slavery before is the condition
01:18
of being a slave but
01:20
what is a slave a slave is a person
01:23
who is owned by another person
01:26
and works for that person without
01:29
payment
01:30
unfortunately for thousands of years
01:34
human beings have treated other human
01:36
beings as
01:37
slaves and we can see this in many
01:40
historical
01:41
periods and in many parts of the world
01:44
and that's basically slavery when you
01:47
own another person usually people would
01:49
fight wars
01:50
and the losers you know if they weren't
01:52
killed they were taken as slaves
01:54
and forced to work for no money
02:00
now a servant is someone who works in
02:03
another person's home
02:04
and usually when we think of servants
02:07
servants are
02:08
paid for their work for example a
02:10
housemaid
02:11
or a butler usually of course these days
02:14
obviously
02:15
servants are paid for their work so
02:16
there are still servants
02:18
around today and of course servants have
02:20
been around again for thousands of years
02:22
as well
02:23
but usually servants would receive money
02:25
or
02:26
some kind of compensation for working in
02:29
usually
02:30
a rich person's house
02:34
escape escape means to get away from
02:37
something
02:38
to run away from something to leave
02:41
a situation that is dangerous or
02:44
unpleasant
02:45
maybe you want to escape from your
02:47
homework yeah but
02:49
homework's it's important to do your
02:50
homework so don't escape
02:52
okay do your homework and then you can
02:54
escape and have fun with your friends
02:56
okay good so that's escape
03:00
civil war now many countries have had
03:02
many different
03:03
wars the civil war is a war in america
03:07
that occurred between 1861 to 1865
03:12
and it was a war between the southern
03:15
states
03:16
and the northern states of america as
03:18
you know
03:19
we talked about in a previous lesson
03:21
america has many different
03:23
states and in the northern part of
03:25
america and the southern part of america
03:27
there are many states now a civil war
03:31
it doesn't matter what country you know
03:32
other countries have also had
03:34
civil wars it's when one part of the
03:37
country
03:38
decides they don't want to be part of
03:41
the bigger country they want to
03:42
break away and make their own country
03:45
and so
03:46
we call that situation a civil war when
03:49
fighting breaks out over that issue
03:51
that would be a civil war okay and in
03:54
this case
03:55
when we when americans talk about the
03:57
civil war they're talking about the war
03:59
between southern
04:00
states and northern states okay
04:04
cotton i mentioned this before when i
04:06
talked about
04:07
plantations cotton is a kind of plant
04:11
that produces white soft hairs
04:14
used to make clothes so obviously this
04:18
is a very
04:19
important crop or plant and this is the
04:22
white
04:22
cotton ball right i don't know
04:25
if you're probably too young
04:29
to know this but people used to use they
04:31
still do use cotton
04:32
balls sometimes for medicine right if
04:34
you have a a
04:36
a wound a scar your mom might take a
04:38
cotton
04:39
cotton ball put it in some alcohol or
04:42
some
04:43
disinfectant and brush your hand with it
04:46
to
04:46
help disinfect your cut
04:49
but cotton was also pulled apart and
04:52
used to make
04:53
thread in clothes and this of course was
04:55
very important
04:57
in making clothes which is a very
04:59
important industry
05:00
in the 1800s and is still an important
05:03
industry today
05:05
so it was a very important crop and it
05:07
was usually grown
05:09
in the southern states why again because
05:11
they had a lot of
05:13
wide open land and the climate was very
05:16
warm
05:17
good for growing plants okay
05:21
sugar cane sugar cane was also another
05:24
and
05:24
still is a very important crop of course
05:27
it's a kind of plant that produces
05:29
sweet crystal-like material used for
05:32
cooking
05:33
sweet crystal-like material used for
05:36
cooking
05:37
that's sugar okay so when you want to
05:40
put a little bit of sugar right
05:42
on your uh on your cereal well don't put
05:44
sugar on your cereal already has
05:47
too much sugar but anyways many foods
05:50
they put
05:50
sugar into it and they get sugar from
05:52
sugar cane did you know that
05:54
these plants they look like bamboo don't
05:56
they but
05:58
they can dry them they can process these
06:01
plants and make
06:02
sugar out of these plants so again sugar
06:05
was
06:05
another very important crop like cotton
06:09
that is grown in southern states and
06:11
also in many
06:12
small islands in the caribbean okay
06:16
those are our words for this lesson
06:21
now one of the main ideas of this unit
06:23
of course is the
06:24
end of slavery and we're talking about
06:26
slavery
06:27
in america which unfortunately slavery
06:30
like i said slavery
06:32
was practiced for thousands of years in
06:34
many countries around the world
06:36
unfortunately in america was one of the
06:38
last
06:39
countries to get rid of slavery in the
06:43
1860s
06:45
so how did this happen what was the
06:49
timeline of slavery in america and when
06:52
did it
06:52
end well a long time ago africans were
06:56
taken from their homes
06:57
and sold as slaves in some parts of
07:00
america
07:01
usually the southern states because why
07:04
in the southern states
07:05
because like i said there were many
07:07
plantations
07:10
and the farmers there grew cotton they
07:12
also grew sugar cane
07:14
also again in many caribbean nations
07:16
like haiti
07:17
and costa rica and in cuba
07:20
they had these very large fields where
07:23
they grew cotton and sugar cane
07:25
and they needed cheap labor they needed
07:28
people to work in these farms
07:31
and of course africa from africa there
07:34
was a slave trade
07:35
and so many slaves were shipped over to
07:37
the americas
07:38
during the 1600s 1700s
07:42
and of course in the 1800s to work
07:45
on these farms and it was a horrible
07:47
terrible thing that happened
07:49
but that's what happened now when slaves
07:52
came to the new world
07:54
which was what america and that area was
07:56
called
07:58
slaves worked as laborers in the fields
08:01
so they worked as laborers in the fields
08:04
or as
08:05
house servants a laborer
08:08
is just somebody who works works hard
08:10
and they do very
08:12
physical jobs like digging or raking or
08:15
picking crops in the fields it's very
08:18
hot it's
08:19
terrible dirty and very difficult
08:22
physically demanding work or as house
08:25
servants
08:26
working in the house uh serving the
08:29
the masters of the plantation the rich
08:31
people who owned
08:33
the farms or the plantations so
08:36
slavery was one of the reasons for the
08:39
war
08:40
called the civil war slavery was one of
08:43
the reasons there were other economical
08:46
economic reasons as well slavery
08:49
and also some issues of independence
08:53
that the southern states had
08:54
disagreements
08:56
with the north and there were some
08:57
tensions but slavery was one of the main
08:59
issues for the civil war the south
09:02
wanted to keep the southern states
09:03
wanted to keep
09:04
slavery as an institution many northern
09:07
states
09:08
didn't have slavery they didn't need it
09:10
they were
09:11
manufacturing they had factories they
09:13
didn't have farms
09:15
they didn't need that many people
09:18
working in the fields in the north
09:20
so the north didn't really have slavery
09:22
and in fact slavery was outlawed it was
09:24
not
09:25
allowed it was not permitted but it was
09:27
allowed in the south
09:28
and this was a major source of tension
09:30
between the northern states
09:32
and the southern states and of course
09:34
these tensions one of one of the main
09:36
tensions
09:37
these tensions became very large
09:40
and the south decided we're leaving the
09:43
the united states of america we're going
09:45
to make our own country
09:47
the southern states lost the war and
09:50
they were they stayed
09:51
inside uh the united states and after
09:53
the war
09:54
president abraham lincoln ended slavery
09:57
after after the north won the war
10:00
and uh president abraham lincoln signed
10:03
a
10:04
a bill or a law it was called the
10:07
emancipation proclamation
10:09
emancipation proclamation and it was
10:12
basically
10:13
a decree or a statement that nobody can
10:16
own
10:17
another person slavery was outlawed
10:20
throughout
10:20
america and that was the emancipation
10:23
proclamation
10:25
okay there are some african-american
10:28
heroes that we can talk about
10:29
harriet tubman is one of them she was a
10:32
slave so she lived
10:34
back in the 1800s and she escaped to
10:37
freedom so she was in the south
10:40
she was a slave in the south she escaped
10:42
to the north where slaves were free
10:44
there were no slaves
10:46
and uh there was you know slavery was
10:48
not allowed so she escaped to the north
10:50
to her freedom and she didn't just rest
10:53
and uh carry on her life and enjoy you
10:57
know being a free person
10:58
she felt a responsibility
11:01
and obligation to help the other people
11:04
like her
11:05
that that she had left when she escaped
11:08
to the north
11:09
so she was very brave she didn't have to
11:11
do this but she volunteered to help
11:13
hundreds
11:15
of other slaves escape she is remembered
11:18
for her courage
11:20
and in fact she's very famous for
11:22
helping with the
11:23
what's called the underground railroad
11:26
it wasn't actually underground people
11:29
sometimes say something is underground
11:31
when it's hidden from sight or it's
11:34
illegal they don't see it
11:36
and so it's kind of hidden the
11:38
underground railroad it wasn't a
11:39
railroad
11:40
that went under the ground no it but it
11:43
was hidden from sight
11:44
so that the authorities the law
11:47
enforcement in the south
11:48
couldn't see them couldn't find them but
11:50
it was a railroad because it helped many
11:52
people go from south
11:53
to the north slaves to escape to their
11:56
freedom in the north and she was very
11:58
important
11:59
for this movement now even though
12:02
slavery ended
12:04
hundreds a hundred years later there
12:07
were still
12:08
problems in america especially with race
12:10
and they still continue to this day of
12:11
course
12:12
there's another famous person jackie
12:14
robinson who in the 1950s
12:17
he became the first african-american
12:21
player in major league baseball major
12:24
league baseball the
12:26
mlb and he played for the dodgers as you
12:28
can see
12:29
on his uniform so although slavery was
12:32
ended there was no more slavery
12:34
in the 1950s african
12:37
americans were not treated equally
12:40
they were there was discrimination right
12:43
so
12:44
they were not treated as an equal person
12:46
now jackie robinson became very famous
12:49
because he was the first
12:50
african-american player
12:51
to be accepted by the dodgers you may
12:54
know the dodgers as a very
12:55
famous american baseball team you think
12:58
oh the la dodgers
12:59
yes they're in los angeles now but they
13:02
used to be in new york
13:03
sometimes teams will change cities
13:05
because people will buy the team
13:07
and move it to another city but in the
13:09
1950s the dodgers were in new york
13:12
and they hired or they recruited
13:16
jackie robinson to play for the team now
13:18
there's a really good movie
13:20
that i recommend to you it's called 42
13:23
and it's a recent movie and it's it
13:26
tells a story about jackie robinson
13:28
it really shows the discrimination
13:32
and the controversy of this story it's a
13:35
very good movie so
13:36
if you have time check it out okay so
13:38
anyway let's move on
13:42
let's do the reading now as usual i will
13:44
read out loud
13:45
you guys repeat after me or repeat in
13:47
your minds let's focus
13:49
on the words from the vocabulary
13:52
not all people in the early united
13:55
states
13:56
were free in some parts of america
14:00
people taken from africa had to work
14:03
in slavery workers on plantations
14:07
worked long hard days
14:10
as slaves
14:13
slaves had to pick cotton in the fields
14:17
or raise crops like sugar cane
14:20
other slaves worked in the homes of
14:23
slave owners
14:24
as servants the life
14:28
of a slave was hard and many slaves
14:31
tried to escape
14:32
to freedom in the north
14:37
unlike the southern states of america
14:40
the
14:40
northern states did not support slavery
14:45
president abraham lincoln decided that
14:49
slavery should end the southern states
14:53
challenged the president's decision
14:57
as a result the northern and southern
15:00
states
15:00
fought the long and terrible civil war
15:04
over the issue of slavery
15:08
in the end the north won and the slaves
15:11
were set
15:12
free
15:16
okay let's take a look at how this
15:17
reading passage was organized and here
15:19
we have
15:20
sequence sequence is like an order of
15:23
events
15:23
what happens first what happens next and
15:26
then what happens in the end
15:27
and this reading passage is kind of
15:30
organized along the lines
15:32
because we're talking about slavery what
15:34
was the beginning of slavery
15:36
what were the effects and how did it end
15:38
and that's what these three boxes
15:40
will tell us so first of all we have
15:43
people taken from
15:44
africa had to work in
15:47
what word from the vocabulary can we use
15:49
here had to work in what
15:52
now you don't say in plantations you
15:55
could say implantations
15:56
but on plantations would be the
15:59
preposition
16:00
they had to work on plantations so you
16:02
have to work on
16:03
farms but in this case we're talking
16:05
about a condition
16:06
what condition was from the vocabulary
16:08
the condition was
16:10
slavery slavery
16:14
so we use in when we describe a
16:16
condition
16:17
in which someone has to work they had to
16:20
work in slavery
16:21
they had to work in bondage they had to
16:25
work
16:26
in some sort of condition but if you're
16:28
talking about where they worked
16:30
if you're talking about farms or ranches
16:32
or plantations
16:33
we use on they worked on farms they
16:36
worked on ranches
16:37
they worked on plantations and that's
16:40
what we have next
16:41
slaves had to work on plantations i just
16:44
said it
16:46
plantations
16:49
or in homes as what do you remember
16:53
people who work in the homes of
16:56
slave owners or rich people servants
17:00
servants so
17:03
up there make my tea there okay or in
17:06
homes as
17:07
servants the life of a slave was hard
17:10
and many slaves of course tried to
17:14
beep to freedom right they try to run
17:16
away what's another word for runaway
17:18
escape escape
17:22
escape to freedom president lincoln
17:25
decided to
17:26
end slavery okay so the first box tells
17:28
us
17:29
the condition uh you know where people
17:31
came from
17:32
the middle box kind of describes what
17:34
the situation was after
17:36
so many years and the last box we'll
17:38
talk about the
17:39
end of slavery so the northern and
17:41
southern states fought a war called
17:43
what was the war called between the
17:45
south and the north
17:47
it was called the civil war
17:50
the civil
17:54
war now here i'd like to point out that
17:56
you need to use
17:57
the because it's a war when we talk
18:00
about wars
18:01
we and we say what kind of war it is we
18:03
say the war because
18:05
unfortunately there are many wars in the
18:07
world
18:08
so when we describe a particular or
18:10
unique war
18:11
we name it and we have to use the
18:13
because we're saying which
18:15
war it's a war which war the
18:18
civil war it's a revolution
18:22
which revolution the french revolution
18:25
so when we talk about events like this
18:27
of course there are many
18:29
type similar type events and we name it
18:31
use
18:32
the okay so the civil war the french
18:35
revolution
18:36
the war of 1812 so we need to use the
18:40
okay the north won and slaves were set
18:44
free abraham lincoln issued the
18:48
emancipation proclamation okay so
18:51
uh in this lesson we took a look at the
18:53
end of slavery it was a terrible period
18:56
for american history it's a shameful uh
18:59
period for american history should have
19:01
never happened
19:02
but it did and that's history and
19:03
there's a lot of things that
19:06
that we can see in history where we hope
19:09
and we
19:10
we have to work so that they never
19:11
happen again we should not forget them
19:14
okay so anyway i hope that you learned a
19:16
lot in the vocabulary for this lesson
19:19
and it was kind of an interesting look
19:21
into the past into the history
19:23
okay thanks for standing with me as
19:24
always and we'll see you again
19:26
in the next lesson take care everybody
19:34
bye-bye
