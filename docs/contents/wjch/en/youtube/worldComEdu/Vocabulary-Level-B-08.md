hello everybody
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
i'm brian stewart
we're continuing our subject of space
but in this lesson lesson 8 we're
talking about
an eclipse an eclipse
so in this lesson we will focus on
let's talk about eclipses
eclipses and what people thought
about them what did people think
about eclipses a long time ago
but first we have to think about what is
an eclipse
we should know that that's a little bit
of a difficult
word isn't it eclipse right
it's a little bit of a difficult word
well an eclipse is shown
in these pictures here what is this
this is a picture of the sun so this is
the sun
in the sky don't look at the sun right
never look at the sun but this is what
it looks like
right if you take a picture of it now
during an eclipse
something is happening to the sun
what's happening is something eating the
sun
no that's what people thought a long
time ago because it looks like
something's eating it
but what's really happening is that this
circle here this is the moon
the moon right so think about this
the sun is really far away the moon
is a lot closer if you're on earth
you're sitting at home
you're of course you're on earth right
but think this is the sun
it's really far away this is the moon
and the moon
sometimes will come like this and it
will cover the sun
of course the moon is very small the sun
is very big but because the moon is
much closer to you it seems a lot bigger
than the sun and in fact it's very
interesting
it's kind of a coincidence that on earth
if the moon
moves directly between you on
earth and the sun it's about the same
size
that's really amazing to look at so what
we have here
is the moon is slowly covering
the sun but don't worry after this
it will go away the sun will come back
right so don't worry
but this is what we call an eclipse now
this here the moon is perfectly
covering the sun that's called a
full eclipse a full eclipse
but you have to be in the right spot
on earth to see a full eclipse
if you're you know a hundred or a
thousand miles
in another direction maybe the moon
doesn't fully
cover the sun maybe it only covers here
and it just moves along and the top part
of the sun is not covered
that would be a partial
a partial eclipse so the moon only
covers
part of the sun as it passes between you
and the sun that would be a partial
eclipse
or a full eclipse when we do the reading
we're going to be
thinking about the full eclipse and if
you ever have a chance to see a full
eclipse
that's great your teacher will tell you
about it but remember
don't ever look at the sun even during a
full eclipse
you should wear special glasses or look
at the shadow of the sun
on a piece of paper through through a
special device
or you could use a camera but don't ever
look at the sun
during an eclipse okay well let's take a
look at some of the words we need to
know
to understand the reading passage about
eclipses
and what people thought about eclipses
the first word here
what well we have a picture what's going
on here we have some eggs
where'd that egg go who took my egg i'm
hungry no i'm just kidding
look there's an egg that's missing it
went from sight we can't see it anymore
what happened
it disappeared so if something is there
one moment and then you look again and
it's not there
it disappeared it disappeared
disappear now be careful when you say
this dis
appear so dis
appear disappear disappear
you can say that something disappears
don't say was disappeared
that's konglish don't say that many
students will say that
say my watch disappeared
my wallet i hope not but
my wallet disappeared right
i had it on my desk then it's gone
it disappeared not it was disappeared
just it disappeared so
it disappeared
that's how you say that it disappeared
the egg disappeared my glasses
disappeared okay so that's the correct
way to use
disappear okay next one two oh my god
oh sorry i was suddenly scared right
what is that that's very scary
i'm afraid okay a devil or bad
spirit another word for a devil
or a bad spirit we call it a demon
demon two words demon demon
but don't worry demons aren't real
okay they're just imagination we
we think of demons right this is a very
scary looking demon right
looks like somebody is dressed up for
halloween
right so demons are from uh like folk
tales or
uh imaginary tales that people tell
demon don't be scared they're not real
okay three oh
so romantic right here's a man he's
proposing to his girlfriend he's
he's proposing with what is this this is
an engagement ring and
gage meant ring
that's kind of a long word for you sorry
ring
engagement ring when a man wants a woman
to marry him he will give her a ring and
he will say
will you marry me and their love will go
on
with no end and it's forever
we hope okay that's the ideal situation
we hope that it goes on forever
sometimes it doesn't but that's another
story okay so but anyway
uh it's an interesting picture to
illustrate forever
hopefully their love will be forever
until they die they will be married they
will live
love each other i hope for the rest of
their lives
for them forever of course when you talk
about forever uh
you know people we don't live forever we
die very quickly
but if we talk about things like things
that go on forever for a very long time
there's no
change right they go on for millions and
millions and millions of years
right we can say that's forever okay
number four
now what's going on here to make the
meaning clear
so this person is explaining something
to this man over here explaining or
telling him exactly what this paper is
about
right to make the meaning of something
clear you
explain please explain
this form to me please
explain this letter to me
explain x x
plane so be careful p l pull
p p explain
explain it's two sounds x
plane explain okay now be careful
do not use about with explain
don't do that don't ever do this please
explain about please
explain about the form no
please explain the form please explain
the problem please explain
to me how to do something but don't say
explain to me about the problem no
don't use about with explain you don't
need to
okay and it's most times it's it's
incorrect
okay so number five get in the way or
stop
this person is playing soccer they're
what we call the goalie right
the goalie or goal keeper you can also
call him the goalkeeper
he wants to stop the ball so what is he
doing he
is blocking to block
block right stop it right stop the ball
or catch the ball
so the ball doesn't go into the goal
right
to get in the way or stop to block
now be careful because when you're
walking on the street you can block
other people right you get in the way
so always you know looking around making
sure you don't block
other people especially when you're
going through a door
or you're going onto the subway or you
know people are coming in and out
unlocking an elevator right so we have
to be careful we don't block
people from moving in and out of buses
subways and elevators so block isn't
just for sports
it's also every day when we're walking
around
okay okay number five six sorry
bad or harmful again another scary
picture right
we have a witch and we have a bat but
there's no batman i'm sorry
what is this we say it's evil bad or
harmful
something that is bad something that is
harmful to many people
we can say one word we can use is evil
evil it's two sounds
you make the the vibration
evil evil evil okay
that's how you pronounce it maybe a
little difficult to pronounce
evil number seven oh look at this
what are these people doing they are
recycling they are
putting together all of the plastic
right
what are they doing they are gathering
all the plastic together
to come together when you put all the
plastic together
you're gathering all the plastic when
you put all the cardboard or paper
together
you're gathering it all together so to
come together
means to gather also people
get together we can say they are
gathering
so it's not just things that gather
people also
gather with their bodies right their
bodies get together
they are gathering maybe it's a concert
a meeting
some type of event people will gather
together
number eight ah she's a musician
right a musical instrument played
by hitting it so what is this
musical instrument what do we call it we
call it
a drum that's very easy it's a drum
now we saw this before and i've just
explained it we used this word at the
beginning of the lesson
do you remember when the moon
is in the sky lights up the sky okay no
sorry that's an italian song okay i'm
sorry
when the moon is between the sun and the
earth
so when the moon is between the earth
and the sun
the moon comes between and it blocks
the sun that's a word we used before
blocks the sun of course we call that
an eclipse an eclipse is when
the moon is between the sun and the
earth
okay ten scared
somebody who's scared another word for
scared very easily
is afraid scared afraid
i am afraid i am scared same thing
before when we saw the picture of the
demon
right there i was scared i was afraid
but just for a second
don't worry demons aren't real okay
11. when i saw this picture i'm like
what is that father doing that's really
really foolish now the word is
silly i could also say you know that's
really
stupid my gosh this father what is he
doing
that's so that's terrible it's foolish
it's silly it's really
stupid i mean this boy or girl i don't
know which
it's very possible she or he will get
hurt
right so it's very foolish very dumb
thing to do another word is dumb i think
oops dump dumb i think in korean
that's b not p dumb i hope i'm not dumb
but uh in korean you say pablo right
pable okay foolish silly stupid or
dumb okay oh my gosh well he scared me
for a minute
okay what's he doing he looks like he
is what he wants something to eat he
is hungry although he kind of looks more
angry than he looks hungry right
but he's really really hungry he's very
fierce
about his hunger okay so he wants
something to eat
he is hungry
okay what's going on here what we're
looking at is to hit the hands together
to make
a noise so we're looking at this action
right here not this action
not anything going on here but we're
looking at this action
right here to hit the hands together to
make
noise what am i doing i am
clapping he is clapping so when you go
to the
theater or if you see a play by other
students
and wow you want to show hey good job
then you
clap right good job so clap
for the people oh this is interesting
are you hungry
hopefully not like that guy we saw
before but uh
this makes me hungry you know i like
apples probably you like apples too
but we can see something interesting
here we can see
many many green apples right there's one
red apple
almost all of something so almost all
the apples are green
one apple is red we can say also most
most of the apples are green but not all
not all of the apples because there's
one apple that's red
and it doesn't matter if it was one or
two maybe two apples are red
we can still say most of the apples are
green
because there's still many many more
green apples
than there are red even if there's one
two maybe this one's red
and this one's red still you still have
many more
green apples so most of the apples are
green most okay
15 a very beautiful town
looks like it's in europe and i just
said the word a place
larger than a village a village is
jogging right just a few houses together
it's just a
small place where people live you know a
few houses together
uh maybe you know 20 families or
something like that
not very big a city is huge
like seoul or busan right very big
many people live there but what's in
between
not as big as seoul not as small as a
tiny village but in between
middle size in the middle we say it's a
town so a town is a place larger than a
village
but smaller than a city okay
sixteen well these kids are having fun
aren't they
to say something in a loud voice
these kids kids like to ah right what
are they doing
they are shouting to
shout to say something in a loud voice
is to shout okay that wraps up the words
let's take a look at some exercises that
we can use
to remember these words okay how well do
you remember the words
we have four words here what we need to
do is
write the word next to its meaning
so we have the definitions here the
meanings
and these are the words that we have to
write in these blanks to match them
with their meanings the words are
disappear
disappear explain
explain forever
forever and evil
evil okay number one
to go from sight to suddenly
you can't see it anymore right you saw
it now but then you look back oh
it's gone it went from your sight what
does that mean
it disappeared it disappeared
okay to disappear three
with no end there's no end it seems to
go on and
on and on there's no end i don't see any
end it is forever
forever number three to make the meaning
clear
so you want to make the meaning of
something clear you're going to talk to
another person
or other people and you're going to make
them understand
the meaning of something you are
explaining
please explain this to them
not explain about explain this
to them just explain four bad
wicked or harmful something that is bad
wicked or harmful of course we have left
evil something that is evil it's bad
it's wicked
or it's harmful okay guess what
hey we have another exercise for you so
in this exercise we need to write a word
from the box under each clue
clue it's um these are the clues that we
have
that go with these words it's not really
matching with the definitions
because they don't define these words
but it's kind of like
a hint or a clue that lets you know what
the word is
let's take a look the words are again we
see
disappear disappear well it's a new one
now
gather gather forever
forever demon demon
and drum drum
okay number one i'm bad and scary
right remember that picture i saw that i
thought oh i was very scared at the
beginning but then i realized
they aren't real but what are they of
course they are demons
demon two bring them all to one place

something together to one place and
either it could be things like
paper plastic or it could be people

hello everybody
00:08
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
00:11
i'm brian stewart
00:12
we're continuing our subject of space
00:16
but in this lesson lesson 8 we're
00:19
talking about
00:20
an eclipse an eclipse
00:24
so in this lesson we will focus on
00:28
let's talk about eclipses
00:31
eclipses and what people thought
00:34
about them what did people think
00:38
about eclipses a long time ago
00:41
but first we have to think about what is
00:45
an eclipse
00:46
we should know that that's a little bit
00:48
of a difficult
00:49
word isn't it eclipse right
00:52
it's a little bit of a difficult word
00:55
well an eclipse is shown
00:57
in these pictures here what is this
01:00
this is a picture of the sun so this is
01:03
the sun
01:04
in the sky don't look at the sun right
01:07
never look at the sun but this is what
01:10
it looks like
01:11
right if you take a picture of it now
01:13
during an eclipse
01:15
something is happening to the sun
01:19
what's happening is something eating the
01:21
sun
01:22
no that's what people thought a long
01:24
time ago because it looks like
01:26
something's eating it
01:27
but what's really happening is that this
01:31
circle here this is the moon
01:34
the moon right so think about this
01:38
the sun is really far away the moon
01:42
is a lot closer if you're on earth
01:44
you're sitting at home
01:45
you're of course you're on earth right
01:47
but think this is the sun
01:48
it's really far away this is the moon
01:51
and the moon
01:52
sometimes will come like this and it
01:55
will cover the sun
01:56
of course the moon is very small the sun
01:58
is very big but because the moon is
02:01
much closer to you it seems a lot bigger
02:04
than the sun and in fact it's very
02:07
interesting
02:08
it's kind of a coincidence that on earth
02:11
if the moon
02:12
moves directly between you on
02:15
earth and the sun it's about the same
02:18
size
02:19
that's really amazing to look at so what
02:21
we have here
02:22
is the moon is slowly covering
02:26
the sun but don't worry after this
02:29
it will go away the sun will come back
02:31
right so don't worry
02:33
but this is what we call an eclipse now
02:36
this here the moon is perfectly
02:40
covering the sun that's called a
02:43
full eclipse a full eclipse
02:46
but you have to be in the right spot
02:50
on earth to see a full eclipse
02:53
if you're you know a hundred or a
02:55
thousand miles
02:56
in another direction maybe the moon
02:59
doesn't fully
03:00
cover the sun maybe it only covers here
03:03
and it just moves along and the top part
03:05
of the sun is not covered
03:07
that would be a partial
03:10
a partial eclipse so the moon only
03:13
covers
03:14
part of the sun as it passes between you
03:18
and the sun that would be a partial
03:20
eclipse
03:21
or a full eclipse when we do the reading
03:24
we're going to be
03:25
thinking about the full eclipse and if
03:27
you ever have a chance to see a full
03:30
eclipse
03:30
that's great your teacher will tell you
03:32
about it but remember
03:33
don't ever look at the sun even during a
03:36
full eclipse
03:38
you should wear special glasses or look
03:40
at the shadow of the sun
03:42
on a piece of paper through through a
03:44
special device
03:46
or you could use a camera but don't ever
03:48
look at the sun
03:49
during an eclipse okay well let's take a
03:52
look at some of the words we need to
03:54
know
03:55
to understand the reading passage about
03:58
eclipses
03:59
and what people thought about eclipses
04:02
the first word here
04:03
what well we have a picture what's going
04:05
on here we have some eggs
04:08
where'd that egg go who took my egg i'm
04:11
hungry no i'm just kidding
04:12
look there's an egg that's missing it
04:16
went from sight we can't see it anymore
04:19
what happened
04:20
it disappeared so if something is there
04:24
one moment and then you look again and
04:27
it's not there
04:29
it disappeared it disappeared
04:32
disappear now be careful when you say
04:34
this dis
04:36
appear so dis
04:39
appear disappear disappear
04:44
you can say that something disappears
04:47
don't say was disappeared
04:51
that's konglish don't say that many
04:54
students will say that
04:55
say my watch disappeared
04:59
my wallet i hope not but
05:03
my wallet disappeared right
05:06
i had it on my desk then it's gone
05:10
it disappeared not it was disappeared
05:14
just it disappeared so
05:17
it disappeared
05:24
that's how you say that it disappeared
05:27
the egg disappeared my glasses
05:31
disappeared okay so that's the correct
05:33
way to use
05:34
disappear okay next one two oh my god
05:38
oh sorry i was suddenly scared right
05:41
what is that that's very scary
05:42
i'm afraid okay a devil or bad
05:46
spirit another word for a devil
05:49
or a bad spirit we call it a demon
05:54
demon two words demon demon
05:57
but don't worry demons aren't real
06:01
okay they're just imagination we
06:04
we think of demons right this is a very
06:06
scary looking demon right
06:08
looks like somebody is dressed up for
06:11
halloween
06:12
right so demons are from uh like folk
06:16
tales or
06:17
uh imaginary tales that people tell
06:20
demon don't be scared they're not real
06:23
okay three oh
06:26
so romantic right here's a man he's
06:29
proposing to his girlfriend he's
06:32
he's proposing with what is this this is
06:35
an engagement ring and
06:38
gage meant ring
06:41
that's kind of a long word for you sorry
06:44
ring
06:45
engagement ring when a man wants a woman
06:49
to marry him he will give her a ring and
06:52
he will say
06:53
will you marry me and their love will go
06:56
on
06:57
with no end and it's forever
07:02
we hope okay that's the ideal situation
07:06
we hope that it goes on forever
07:08
sometimes it doesn't but that's another
07:10
story okay so but anyway
07:12
uh it's an interesting picture to
07:14
illustrate forever
07:16
hopefully their love will be forever
07:19
until they die they will be married they
07:21
will live
07:21
love each other i hope for the rest of
07:24
their lives
07:25
for them forever of course when you talk
07:28
about forever uh
07:30
you know people we don't live forever we
07:32
die very quickly
07:33
but if we talk about things like things
07:35
that go on forever for a very long time
07:38
there's no
07:38
change right they go on for millions and
07:41
millions and millions of years
07:43
right we can say that's forever okay
07:45
number four
07:47
now what's going on here to make the
07:49
meaning clear
07:50
so this person is explaining something
07:54
to this man over here explaining or
07:58
telling him exactly what this paper is
08:01
about
08:02
right to make the meaning of something
08:04
clear you
08:05
explain please explain
08:09
this form to me please
08:13
explain this letter to me
08:16
explain x x
08:20
plane so be careful p l pull
08:23
p p explain
08:28
explain it's two sounds x
08:31
plane explain okay now be careful
08:35
do not use about with explain
08:40
don't do that don't ever do this please
08:45
explain about please
08:48
explain about the form no
08:51
please explain the form please explain
08:55

08:59
to me how to do something but don't say
09:02
explain to me about the problem no
09:06
don't use about with explain you don't
09:08
need to
09:09
okay and it's most times it's it's
09:12
incorrect
09:13
okay so number five get in the way or
09:16
stop
09:17
this person is playing soccer they're
09:20
what we call the goalie right
09:22
the goalie or goal keeper you can also
09:25
call him the goalkeeper
09:27
he wants to stop the ball so what is he
09:29
doing he
09:30
is blocking to block
09:33
block right stop it right stop the ball
09:36
or catch the ball
09:37
so the ball doesn't go into the goal
09:39
right
09:40
to get in the way or stop to block
09:43
