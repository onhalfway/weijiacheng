hello everyone welcome back to american
textbook reading series i'm brian
stewart
we're looking at social studies book
three
lesson five for this lesson today
and in lesson five is about voting for
leaders voting for
leaders you will discover in this unit
how to vote and what
citizens and leaders should do
so this is part of the democratic
process
is what we will be taking a look at
today okay
so as usual let's start with the
vocabulary
first we have lead this guy looks very
happy right
he's leading the people behind him he's
showing
others the way leaders have ideas
about which way to go how to solve
problems
usually which way should we go should we
solve the problem this way
should we go this way or should we go
this way leaders
choose the way and show people let's go
this way
and they lead the other people in that
way to solve the problem or to do
something that is good
next sign up
sign up when you sign up it means you
volunteer or you
agree to be a member of a group
by writing your name if there is a club
at your school like let's say there's a
book club a group of students
get together and read books and talk
about them
well if you want to join them you
probably have to
sign up in other words they have a form
a membership
form a membership form
member
ship form a form
is a very common word form that's an o
form a form is a piece of paper with
uh parts printed like name and then you
fill in your name you fill in a
form fill in okay i'm giving you a lot
of words sorry about that
but but you fill in the form you sign up
for a group you sign up for uh
a club or a team or some other
group by writing your name on the form
okay next we have run
for office run for office
this is a little bit of an old picture
but i recognize him right away
john mccain he ran for
president in 2008.
uh so he ran for print he tried to be
president he didn't make it
he wasn't voted as a president but he
ran for
president so when people say they're
going to run for office
it doesn't mean they're actually running
it means they're going to try to be
elected
as a public official and they run props
they try to get people to vote for them
the person with the most
votes wins the election so the winners
and the losers
both run for office so they all run for
office
but only a certain number of people
can be elected to office elected to
office
okay disagree if you disagree with
someone
you have a different opinion about
something
than they do we have two women here the
one
on the left side says yes
i agree but the woman on the right side
says
no i don't agree so they disagree
right if you say no about something and
somebody says yes
they disagree with you right okay
so to disagree this by the way this is
easy to remember this
is a prefix it means not so very simply
not agree you do not agree this means
not okay
resolve resolve remember
in a previous lesson we learned solve
right so
solve is to find a solution to a problem
or to
solve a problem right but resolve
means to find a way to solve a problem
when
it is in disagreement so some people
think
we should do this but other people think
we should do this to solve a problem
you resolve the problem is you find
a way to make everybody agree or
everybody happy
in a type of situation when two groups
or
two or three or could be four or five it
could be many groups
don't agree and you resolve the
situation
means you try to find a solution that is
acceptable to
all the groups who previously disagreed
again they still might disagree but at
least if you resolve the situation you
find a solution
that makes them satisfied that satisfies
all people involved in the disagreement
okay conflict
conflict is a disagreement about
something
when people are in conflict they do not
agree
and they might argue hopefully they
don't fight
conflict can also mean fight so for
example in the middle east
we hear of many conflicts and that's
when you know
not just countries but groups within
countries are fighting actually fighting
with each other
we say this area is under conflict but
conflict can also mean just
arguing speaking and that's that's a
better type of conflict of course
so conflict means a disagreement about
something
okay those are our words for this lesson
okay now let's take a look at some more
ideas
where we can use these words
okay the first idea we're going to take
a look at is how to vote
so if you live in a democratic society
and of course you probably do if you're
watching this
i hope so most people in the world do
and i hope
everyone in the world one day will live
in a democratic society
where they are able to vote for
their leaders how to vote but how do you
vote
right i mean you're young now so you
don't have to worry about this but when
you get older make sure you vote okay
you want to choose your leaders so how
to vote first
what should you do fill out a form
remember before i said
fill out and i told you what form is so
you
fill out a form means you put your
information
on the form right you fill out a form
and you send it to the election office
this means you are
signing up to vote you can't just go and
vote you show up they don't know who you
are so before you go there you have to
let them know
this is who i am this is where i live
i'm a real person
i'm not a fake person i'm actually who i
say i
am you need to sign up before you go and
vote
and you fill out a form send it to the
election office so they know who you are
when you come next you should read
newspaper articles read as much as you
can
about the people who are running for
office watch debates on tv
oh i'm just kidding i'm skipping ahead
so first well it doesn't matter you can
do these all at the same time but read
newspaper articles
talk to people in your neighborhood talk
to your neighbors talk to your friends
who do you like why not just who do you
like but why is it very important
right don't just vote for somebody
because your best friend likes them
ask your best friend why do you like
them and if they have a good argument
maybe you will also agree with them
get information make decisions that's
important right so you talk to neighbors
you watch debates on tv
usually the people running for office
they will have a debate
on television right it's not just two it
could be many people right
five six seven eight nine ten right it
could be many
people running for office i want to
teach you another word
candid date
a candidate is a person who runs for
office so the candidates will have a
debate on television
watch it see who makes the best argument
see who you
agree with search for information on the
internet
yes the information internet is a great
place to get
information but be careful of the places
you
go on the internet make sure the source
of that information
is trusted and is a good source
because unfortunately you can get a lot
of bad information
on the internet as well so look for
large organizations
organizations that have a good
reputation
and then you can trust the source of
that information
after you get all this info you're
getting information you're getting
information from newspapers
from television from your neighbors from
the internet get all this information
and then make a decision in your brain
right make your own decision then
when you've made your decision you can
go to the election office or the
election
booth and you can mark your choices on a
piece of paper
called a ballot a ballot what is a
ballot a ballot is another type of
form and the form will have the names
of the people the candidates who are
running for office and you will check or
you will mark
make a mark next to the name of the
person
you want to vote for okay and that is
voting that is vote
to vote when you mark the choices on a
piece of paper you're voting
and then like this man here you put your
piece of paper
in the box it's a secure box right only
officials can open the box and they
count
those votes and they count your vote and
your vote
your vote is counted so
make sure that your vote
is counted if you don't
vote they will not count your vote
but so make sure that you vote so that
your vote is
counted that's an important thing to do
in a democratic society
okay good the next idea
is what citizens and leaders have to do
well of course a democracy
is a team effort right it's not just the
leaders
but the citizens have to support their
leaders so citizens have to trust
leaders
and they keep telling leaders what they
want for the community
as a voter as a citizen
you should tell your leader what you
want them to do
right and hopefully they will do it if
they don't do it
they lose the next election they're
kicked out
okay leaders what should they do
they have to resolve conflicts between
citizens
and they have to keep listening to them
if they don't listen to their
to their uh citizens again
they get kicked out of office in the
next election
okay so it's a teamwork citizens and
leaders
should work together okay good
let's take a look at the reading
okay let's do the reading together and
as always you can read along with me
real silently in your head or out loud
practice pronunciation
and focus on the words that we learned
in the vocabulary section you ready
here we go choosing
a leader is important to every society
a leader makes decisions for all
citizens it is the job
of the leader to lead people to a better
future
so a leader leads people
okay next
if a person feels they will be a good
leader they can sign up to
run for office
if you think you're you could be a good
leader
you should sign up to run for office
when you get older great okay next
to make sure a good leader is chosen
citizens get information about
people who want to become a leader
from newspapers tv
the internet etc
okay etc don't say it's
okay etc means and so on and so forth
etc okay
then the citizens make decisions and
vote for the person they want to lead
them
people sometimes disagree about the
leader they want
and voting is a good way to solve
such disagreements
people in the community should trust the
leader
a good leader should be able to resolve
conflicts between community members
and keep order so that everyone
is happy keep order make sure
that everybody obeys the rules
that people don't disrespect each other
or their society and just do what they
want without
thinking about other people so
as we can see people have
responsibilities
citizens have responsibilities leaders
have responsibilities it's teamwork
in order to make a good democracy work
okay that's our reading let's take a
look at how it is
organized okay so the idea of this
reading passage
is to think about sequence sequence
means what comes first next
next and next so first second third
fourth
what is the sequence of events
if you want to run for office you want
to be mayor
or president or a senator
you might want you might think okay well
how do i do that what is this sequence
of events
to do that let's go through them so
first of all
first of course the person has to decide
to become a leader
if a person feels they will be a good
leader
they can beep to beep office
oh many beeps okay so so first of all
what do they do
so you think i want to be a good leader
so what should you do first well you
should right put your name down on a
form
fill out a form and what we call that in
the vocabulary is to sign
up sign up sign
up now here we have sign up 2 right but
you can also say
sign up for
when you say sign up for you usually
have a noun here
so you sign up for a team sign up for a
club
but in this case we have two right so
in this case we need to say to do
something
sign up to play soccer sign up to
uh debate on your school's debate team
right so we need a verb here they can
sign up to
beep office now remember when somebody
tries to get elected what do we call
that
we say they are running for office
to run r
u n run
for two words run for office remember it
doesn't mean they're actually running
right it means that they're trying to
get elected so sign up to run for
office okay so that's the thing so they
do that first
and then citizens get information about
leaders or
candidates maybe they're not leaders yet
but the candidates
to beep a good leader is chosen so you
want to what you want
from the reading it's not a vocabulary
word but from the reading it said to
make sure to
make sure
yep so citizens get information about
leaders to make
sure a good leader is choosing chosen
sorry
chosen not chosen chosen choice
choose chosen well so
choose chose
chose okay so choose chose chose many
students get that mixed up right they
say choose enter
or they mispronounce it so chosen make
sure someone good
is chosen what did you choose
okay so make sure a good leader is
chosen
make sure means to ensure or
are to be correct right to make a good
decision you want to make sure
it's correct okay so make sure a good
leader is chosen
make sure that's the right person for
the job
now citizens make decisions right so you
make a decision
and then after you made your decision
you need to go to the
uh place and where you fill out your
ballot
and put it in the box and what do we
call that citizens make decisions
and vote
vote for actually remember these two
words together
who did you vote for vote for
these two words are usually together
right i will vote for mccain
i will vote for obama right who did you
vote for okay and vote for the person
they
want who is the person you want you will
vote for
that person vote for somebody
okay well that's our lesson today it's
kind of interesting it's about the
voting process
you don't have to worry about it now but
in a few years
you will be able to vote right you have
to be a certain age and make sure that
you vote
you want to have your voice heard you
want you to have your vote
counted you want your uh decision
to be made and you want to make sure
it's a good one so make sure that you
get a lot of information make your
decision and then go and vote
because it's part of being a citizen in
a democratic society
all right good job everybody thanks for
standing with me we'll see you in the
next one
take care bye bye

hello everyone welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading series i'm brian

stewart
00:14
we're looking at social studies book
00:16

00:17
lesson five for this lesson today
00:20
and in lesson five is about voting for
00:23
leaders voting for
00:27
leaders you will discover in this unit
00:30
how to vote and what
00:33
citizens and leaders should do
00:37
so this is part of the democratic
00:40
process
00:41
is what we will be taking a look at
00:43
today okay
00:44
so as usual let's start with the
00:47
vocabulary
00:49
first we have lead this guy looks very
00:53
happy right
00:54
he's leading the people behind him he's
00:57
showing
00:58
others the way leaders have ideas
01:02
about which way to go how to solve
01:05
problems
01:06
usually which way should we go should we
01:08
solve the problem this way
01:10
should we go this way or should we go
01:12
this way leaders
01:13
choose the way and show people let's go
01:16
this way
01:17
and they lead the other people in that
01:20
way to solve the problem or to do
01:23
something that is good
01:25
next sign up
01:28
sign up when you sign up it means you
01:31
volunteer or you
01:33
agree to be a member of a group
01:36
by writing your name if there is a club
01:39
at your school like let's say there's a
01:41
book club a group of students
01:43
get together and read books and talk
01:45
about them
01:46
well if you want to join them you
01:49
probably have to
01:50
sign up in other words they have a form
01:52
a membership
01:54
form a membership form
01:58
member
02:01
ship form a form
02:04
is a very common word form that's an o
02:08
form a form is a piece of paper with
02:11
uh parts printed like name and then you
02:14
fill in your name you fill in a
02:18
form fill in okay i'm giving you a lot
02:21
of words sorry about that
02:22
but but you fill in the form you sign up
02:26
for a group you sign up for uh
02:29
a club or a team or some other
02:32
group by writing your name on the form
02:36
okay next we have run
02:39
for office run for office
02:43
this is a little bit of an old picture
02:45
but i recognize him right away
02:47
john mccain he ran for
02:51
president in 2008.
02:55
uh so he ran for print he tried to be
02:58
president he didn't make it
03:00
he wasn't voted as a president but he
03:02
ran for
03:04
president so when people say they're
03:06
going to run for office
03:07
it doesn't mean they're actually running
03:09
it means they're going to try to be
03:11
elected
03:12
as a public official and they run props
03:16
they try to get people to vote for them
03:18
the person with the most
03:19
votes wins the election so the winners
03:22
and the losers
03:23
both run for office so they all run for
03:27
office
03:27
but only a certain number of people
03:31
can be elected to office elected to
03:34
office
03:35
okay disagree if you disagree with
03:39
someone
03:40
you have a different opinion about
03:43
something
03:44
than they do we have two women here the
03:47
one
03:47
on the left side says yes
03:50
i agree but the woman on the right side
03:53
says
03:54
no i don't agree so they disagree
03:58
right if you say no about something and
04:00
somebody says yes
04:02
they disagree with you right okay
04:05
so to disagree this by the way this is
04:09
easy to remember this
04:12
is a prefix it means not so very simply
04:16
not agree you do not agree this means
04:20
not okay
04:24
resolve resolve remember
04:28
in a previous lesson we learned solve
04:32
right so
04:35
solve is to find a solution to a problem
04:38
or to
04:38
solve a problem right but resolve
04:42
means to find a way to solve a problem
04:44
when
04:45
it is in disagreement so some people
04:48
think
04:48
we should do this but other people think
04:50
we should do this to solve a problem
04:52
you resolve the problem is you find
04:56
a way to make everybody agree or
04:58
everybody happy
05:00
in a type of situation when two groups
05:02
or
05:03
two or three or could be four or five it
05:05
could be many groups
05:06
don't agree and you resolve the
05:09
situation
05:10
means you try to find a solution that is
05:13
acceptable to
05:14
all the groups who previously disagreed
05:18
again they still might disagree but at
05:20
least if you resolve the situation you
05:23
find a solution
05:24
that makes them satisfied that satisfies
05:27
all people involved in the disagreement
05:31
okay conflict
05:34
conflict is a disagreement about
05:36
something
05:37
when people are in conflict they do not
05:39
agree
05:40
and they might argue hopefully they
05:43
don't fight
05:43
conflict can also mean fight so for
05:46
example in the middle east
05:47
we hear of many conflicts and that's
05:49
when you know
05:50
not just countries but groups within
05:52
countries are fighting actually fighting
05:54
with each other
05:55
we say this area is under conflict but
05:58
conflict can also mean just
05:59
arguing speaking and that's that's a
06:02
better type of conflict of course
06:04
so conflict means a disagreement about
06:07
something
06:07
okay those are our words for this lesson
06:10
okay now let's take a look at some more
06:13
ideas
06:14
where we can use these words
06:17
okay the first idea we're going to take
06:19
a look at is how to vote
06:21
so if you live in a democratic society
06:24
and of course you probably do if you're
06:25
watching this
06:26
i hope so most people in the world do
06:29
and i hope
06:30
everyone in the world one day will live
06:32
in a democratic society
06:34
where they are able to vote for
06:37
their leaders how to vote but how do you
06:40
vote
06:40
right i mean you're young now so you
06:43
don't have to worry about this but when
06:44
you get older make sure you vote okay
06:46
you want to choose your leaders so how
06:48
to vote first
06:50
what should you do fill out a form
06:52
remember before i said
06:53
fill out and i told you what form is so
06:56
you
06:56
fill out a form means you put your
06:59
information
07:00
on the form right you fill out a form
07:03
and you send it to the election office
07:05
this means you are
07:07
signing up to vote you can't just go and
07:09
vote you show up they don't know who you
07:11
are so before you go there you have to
07:13
let them know
07:14
this is who i am this is where i live
07:17
i'm a real person
07:18
i'm not a fake person i'm actually who i
07:21
say i
07:21
am you need to sign up before you go and
07:25
vote
07:26
and you fill out a form send it to the
07:28
election office so they know who you are
07:30
when you come next you should read
07:34
newspaper articles read as much as you
07:38
can
07:38
about the people who are running for
07:42
office watch debates on tv
07:45
oh i'm just kidding i'm skipping ahead
07:47
so first well it doesn't matter you can
07:48
do these all at the same time but read
07:50
newspaper articles
07:52
talk to people in your neighborhood talk
07:54
to your neighbors talk to your friends
07:56
who do you like why not just who do you
07:58
like but why is it very important
08:00
right don't just vote for somebody
08:02
because your best friend likes them
08:04
ask your best friend why do you like
08:06
them and if they have a good argument
08:08
maybe you will also agree with them
08:11
get information make decisions that's
08:13
important right so you talk to neighbors
08:15
you watch debates on tv
08:17
usually the people running for office
08:19
they will have a debate
08:21
on television right it's not just two it
08:23
could be many people right
08:25
five six seven eight nine ten right it
08:27
could be many
08:29
people running for office i want to
08:31
teach you another word
08:34
candid date
08:38
a candidate is a person who runs for
08:42
office so the candidates will have a
08:44
debate on television
08:46
watch it see who makes the best argument
08:49
see who you
08:50
agree with search for information on the
08:53
internet
08:54
yes the information internet is a great
08:56
place to get
08:57
information but be careful of the places
09:00
you
09:01
go on the internet make sure the source
09:03
of that information
09:05
is trusted and is a good source
09:08
because unfortunately you can get a lot
09:10
of bad information
09:11
on the internet as well so look for
09:14
large organizations
09:16
organizations that have a good
09:18
reputation
09:20
and then you can trust the source of
09:22
that information
09:24
after you get all this info you're
09:26
getting information you're getting
09:27
information from newspapers
09:29
from television from your neighbors from
09:31
the internet get all this information
09:33
and then make a decision in your brain
09:36
right make your own decision then
09:40
when you've made your decision you can
09:42
go to the election office or the
09:43
election
09:44
booth and you can mark your choices on a
09:47
piece of paper
09:48
called a ballot a ballot what is a
09:51
ballot a ballot is another type of
09:54
form and the form will have the names
09:57
of the people the candidates who are
10:01
running for office and you will check or
10:04
you will mark
10:06
make a mark next to the name of the
10:08
person
10:09
you want to vote for okay and that is
10:12
voting that is vote
10:14
to vote when you mark the choices on a
10:15
piece of paper you're voting
10:17
and then like this man here you put your
10:19
piece of paper
10:20
in the box it's a secure box right only
10:23
officials can open the box and they
10:25
count
10:26
those votes and they count your vote and
10:28
your vote
10:29
your vote is counted so
10:32
make sure that your vote
10:37
is counted if you don't
10:41
vote they will not count your vote
10:44
but so make sure that you vote so that
10:47
your vote is
10:48
counted that's an important thing to do
10:51
in a democratic society
10:53
okay good the next idea
10:56
is what citizens and leaders have to do
10:59
well of course a democracy
11:01
is a team effort right it's not just the
11:04
leaders
11:05
but the citizens have to support their
11:07
leaders so citizens have to trust
11:09
leaders
11:11
and they keep telling leaders what they
11:13
want for the community
11:14
as a voter as a citizen
11:18
you should tell your leader what you
11:19
want them to do
11:21
right and hopefully they will do it if
11:22
they don't do it
11:24
they lose the next election they're
11:26
kicked out
11:27
okay leaders what should they do
11:30
they have to resolve conflicts between
11:33
citizens
11:34
and they have to keep listening to them
11:36
if they don't listen to their
11:38
to their uh citizens again
11:41
they get kicked out of office in the
11:43
next election
11:44
okay so it's a teamwork citizens and
11:47
leaders
11:47
should work together okay good
11:51
let's take a look at the reading
11:56
okay let's do the reading together and
11:58
as always you can read along with me
12:00
real silently in your head or out loud
12:03
practice pronunciation
12:05
and focus on the words that we learned
12:08
in the vocabulary section you ready
12:11
here we go choosing
12:14
a leader is important to every society
12:19
a leader makes decisions for all
12:22
citizens it is the job
12:26
of the leader to lead people to a better
12:30
future
12:31
so a leader leads people
12:34
okay next
12:38
if a person feels they will be a good
12:42
leader they can sign up to
12:45
run for office
12:49
if you think you're you could be a good
12:51
leader
12:52
you should sign up to run for office
12:55
when you get older great okay next
12:59
to make sure a good leader is chosen
13:04
citizens get information about
13:07
people who want to become a leader
13:11
from newspapers tv
13:14
the internet etc
13:18
okay etc don't say it's
13:22
okay etc means and so on and so forth
13:26
etc okay
13:29
then the citizens make decisions and
13:32
vote for the person they want to lead
13:36
them
13:37
people sometimes disagree about the
13:40
leader they want
13:41
and voting is a good way to solve
13:45
such disagreements
13:50
people in the community should trust the
13:53
leader
13:54
a good leader should be able to resolve
13:58
conflicts between community members
14:02
and keep order so that everyone
14:05
is happy keep order make sure
14:09
that everybody obeys the rules
14:12
that people don't disrespect each other
14:16
or their society and just do what they
14:18
want without
14:19
thinking about other people so
14:22
as we can see people have
14:24
responsibilities
14:26
citizens have responsibilities leaders
14:28
have responsibilities it's teamwork
14:30
in order to make a good democracy work
14:34
okay that's our reading let's take a
14:36
look at how it is
14:37
organized okay so the idea of this
14:42
reading passage
14:43
is to think about sequence sequence
14:46
means what comes first next
14:49
next and next so first second third
14:52
fourth
14:52
what is the sequence of events
14:56
if you want to run for office you want
14:58
to be mayor
14:59
or president or a senator
15:02
you might want you might think okay well
15:05
how do i do that what is this sequence
15:07
of events
15:08
to do that let's go through them so
15:10
first of all
15:11
first of course the person has to decide
15:14
to become a leader
15:15
if a person feels they will be a good
15:18
leader
15:18
they can beep to beep office
15:22
oh many beeps okay so so first of all
15:24
what do they do
15:25
so you think i want to be a good leader
15:27
so what should you do first well you
15:29
should right put your name down on a
15:33
form
15:34
fill out a form and what we call that in
15:36
the vocabulary is to sign
15:38
up sign up sign
15:44
up now here we have sign up 2 right but
15:47
you can also say
15:48
sign up for
15:52
when you say sign up for you usually
15:54
have a noun here
15:55
so you sign up for a team sign up for a
15:58
club
15:59
but in this case we have two right so
16:02
in this case we need to say to do
16:05
something
16:06
sign up to play soccer sign up to
16:09
uh debate on your school's debate team
16:12
right so we need a verb here they can
16:15
sign up to
16:16
beep office now remember when somebody
16:19
tries to get elected what do we call
16:21
that
16:22
we say they are running for office
16:25
to run r
16:28
u n run
16:31
for two words run for office remember it
16:34
doesn't mean they're actually running
16:36
right it means that they're trying to
16:37
get elected so sign up to run for
16:40
office okay so that's the thing so they
16:42
do that first
16:43
and then citizens get information about
16:47
leaders or
16:47
candidates maybe they're not leaders yet
16:50
but the candidates
16:51
to beep a good leader is chosen so you
16:54
want to what you want
16:56
from the reading it's not a vocabulary
16:57
word but from the reading it said to
17:00
make sure to
17:03
make sure
17:08
yep so citizens get information about
17:10
leaders to make
17:11
sure a good leader is choosing chosen
17:14
sorry
17:14
chosen not chosen chosen choice
17:18
choose chosen well so
17:22
choose chose
17:25
chose okay so choose chose chose many
17:29
students get that mixed up right they
17:30
say choose enter
17:32
or they mispronounce it so chosen make
17:35
sure someone good
17:36
is chosen what did you choose
17:40
okay so make sure a good leader is
17:43
chosen
17:44
make sure means to ensure or
17:47
are to be correct right to make a good
17:50
decision you want to make sure
17:52
it's correct okay so make sure a good
17:54
leader is chosen
17:55
make sure that's the right person for
17:58
the job
17:59
now citizens make decisions right so you
18:02
make a decision
18:03
and then after you made your decision
18:05
you need to go to the
18:07
uh place and where you fill out your
18:10
ballot
18:11
and put it in the box and what do we
18:13
call that citizens make decisions
18:16
and vote
18:19
vote for actually remember these two
18:21
words together
18:23
who did you vote for vote for
18:26
these two words are usually together
18:28

18:31

18:34
vote for okay and vote for the person
18:38
they
18:38
want who is the person you want you will
18:41
vote for
18:42
that person vote for somebody
18:45
okay well that's our lesson today it's
18:47

18:49
voting process
18:50
you don't have to worry about it now but
18:52
