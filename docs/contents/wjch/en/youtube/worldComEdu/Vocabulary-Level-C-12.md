of course you do it's transformers
everybody knows the transformers this is
a good movie
as an example to show robots
as actors in movies and that's what this
lesson is about today
let's take a look though at the
vocabulary so let's start
whoa i'm sorry we went from a very
exciting picture
to a very difficult picture what is all
this math and look at this boy he looks
very serious doesn't he
okay someone who is very smart
someone who is very smart like if this
boy can do
all of these math problems i don't even
know what these math problems are
if he can do those he is a genius
he's a genius genius are you a genius
are you really really smart in math are
you really smart
in languages or maybe you're smart in
something else
there are different types of geniuses
right so
maybe you're a genius in one area or
another okay
so the a person who's very smart
is a genius okay
next one far away so if that city is
really far away we can say
it is distant distant uh
if you see mountains very far away those
mountains
are distant distant far away
okay next one to change into something
else okay so a long time ago this was
all rock
but water and wind came through and
changed these rocks into very
interesting shapes
what happened they transformed
trans trans of course is a cross and
form is shape so across different shapes
transform this is a verb to change
to change into something else remember
the movie uh
poster we saw at the beginning
transformers
of course those are about robots that
can change their
shape into something else and we'll
read about that in the passage whoa
there's a funny guy right he's a funny
looking guy
maybe he wants to hide himself to hide
yourself by looking
different right he doesn't look like
that he doesn't have such big eyebrows
he doesn't have a big nose or a mustache
but he put it on maybe he wants to hide
who he really is so what is he doing
he is disguising to disguise
yourself right also disguise can be a
noun
also right but here it is a verb
in this definition to hide
that is a verb but it can also be a noun
the glasses with the big nose and the
mustache
that is a disguise so you put on a
disguise
you can put on put on
a disguise so you can use
disguise as a verb or as a noun
if you use it as a noun you can say put
on
a disguise put on a disguise and
disguise can be closed
too if you want to hide your true
identity you don't want
anybody to know who you are put on a
disguise
disguise yourself okay next one
hey you know this guy right that's
spider-man the amazing spider-man
he's the good character in a story
now unfortunately in many stories
spider-man people think he's a bad guy
right but spider-man's really he's
really the good guy
who is he he's the hero he's the hero of
the movie
the good character the person who does
good things and helps other people that
is the hero
of the movie okay now movies usually
have heroes
but then also movies have somebody who
fights against the hero
the main bad character in a story
and these are the people who fight
against the hero right
so movies of course many movies show
conflict
you have good and evil good guys
bad guys and they're fighting against
each other well the heroes are the good
guys
who are the bad guys what do we call
them we can call them
villain a villain is a bad guy
so villains are the bad characters
in movies the villains are
fighting the heroes of the movies who
wins
well usually in a movie the hero wins
right
usually especially uh movies about uh
superheroes
the good guy always wins doesn't he or
she there's lots of
uh female heroes too super uh action or
superheroes that are female as well
so it's the the good guy or the good
girl
who always wins in these types of movies
right but the villains usually lose
okay not caring if you hurt
others so if somebody doesn't care if
you hurt others
this is a bad thing right it's not a
good thing it's what the villain would
do right
the villains are ruthless ruthless
is an adjective it's an adjective
it's used to describe
what somebody is like what is their
personality like
what is their character like they are
ruthless
it means they don't care if they hurt
other people
that's very bad right a person who
doesn't care if they hurt other people
right they just do what they want they
want to get what they want they don't
care
about other people that's ruthless it's
bad that would be a villain
a bad guy or a bad character okay
using great force to hurt others like in
this movie oh
no he's kicking him right there that
looks very painful right
so what is this this is violent this is
violent
action violent is also an adjective
it's an oh that's so strange j isn't it
it's an
adjective violent it's a violent scene
it's a violent act he's a violent
person so we use violent as an adjective
in front of a noun to show that
something or somebody's using great
force
to hurt other people it's a violent
movie
it's a violent uh scene it's a violent
person okay so violent is an adjective
to describe person place thing okay
next one do you remember this movie i
don't know if you remember it it's a
little bit old
right maybe before you were born i don't
know it's
of course called robocop it was a cool
movie the first one right
uh there's been others too but this is
robocop
he's a he's a he's part human part
robot right part machine but he's human
inside and this of course is just a
robot
to show as a main part now to show as a
main part
we are to feature so robocop features
this character here and also this is the
bad guy in the end of the movie
this is also a part of the movie to show
as a main part
the main part of a movie especially is
the feature
for example this is usually used to
describe
the actors or actresses in a movie for
example you can say
the new movie is going to feature brad
pitt
that means brad pitt will be a main part
of the movie
you could also say the new movie will
feature new york
which means a place new york the setting
the place will be a main part
of the movie so to show as a main part
it can be a person it can be a thing
it can be you know a machine an animal
it could be
anything really it's just a main part of
something it
features that thing or that person
okay what we use to speak
and write what am i using right now to
speak to you
i'm using english right what is english
english is
a language of course you normally
use korean to speak and write that
is your language right now you are
learning
a different language you're learning
english
so language is what we use to speak
and write notice that this is not
language
be careful these i would call these
letters not alphabets
don't say these are alphabets these are
letters
alphabet is the whole set of letters
from a
to z in english the whole set
is alphabet individual
symbols are letters okay and
of course letters are part of language
these letters
are part of the english language these
letters are a feature of the english
language
okay so yeah we work the vocabulary
together okay next one
oh what happened to him i think he's
drinking too much right
very dangerous okay well he fell down
and he's probably pushing the horn a
short high-pitched
sound so maybe goes beep beep right
look at that that's the word some words
in english
are the same as the sound
that they make right so if you push the
horn
on a car right the horn on a car it
makes a high-pitched sound
we say that sound is a beep and that's
what it sounds like it's beep
the sound and the word are the same
sometimes we hear that right sometimes
that's true
in english okay so that's a good word
there
to show that the the word and the sound
are the same thing
okay next to be successful
in a game or fight ah what happened here
we can see what happened very
easily oh these two uh
ladies were playing a game one person is
going to do what
one person is going to win the other
person
is going to lose so
who do you think won who do you think
lost
when is a past is a irregular verb so i
said one
win won one who won
she won obviously who lost oh
lose lost lost right
she lost okay so somebody will win
somebody will lose after the game who
won
she won she lost okay so
which team won that team won that team
lost
okay next word wow this is a big
airplane right
this is a plane driven by jet engines
jet engine is here and here now
a long time ago there were no jet
engines planes used propellers now i'm
not a very good
artist so i'm trying to draw these it
looks like a flower doesn't it
but these things would spin really fast
and they would catch the air
and push the plane forward and these
were called
propellers propeller
a propeller plane so we said propeller
plane or
sometimes we will say prop plane
propeller plane or prop plane
but then of course technology improves
now we have jet engines
what kind of plane do we call that we
call that a
jet so it's really the same thing a jet
engine it's a jet
if it has a jet engine oh there's two
more over here too
don't forget those okay if it has a jet
engine
it is a jet okay
oh that's too bad what happened here a
problem or
difficulty right there's a problem with
the engine
in this car so a problem or difficulty
is trouble
now this is a good uh picture to show
for this word
because in this case we can say she
has car
trouble and that's a very common
expression right
she has car trouble do you have car
trouble if your car breaks down
it's a very common expression do you
have car trouble
or she has car trouble okay interesting
expression
okay next a vehicle for carrying
goods now a vehicle for carrying goods
this is a special type of vehicle
you would not call this a car it's not a
car
it's a truck a truck is
a big vehicle and it has a big
area a big space you can put many things
inside whether it's
rocks like this or sometimes it's all
closed and it has a roof
and it has a door back here and you can
put stuff inside
that's a tractor trailer okay
that carries you know like electronic
goods from the factory to the store
or many other types of products okay
there's many different kinds of trucks
also a pickup truck which is smaller one
person uses
and they can put their furniture or
their tools in the back of the truck
and drive to the job but it's much
smaller trucks are different shapes and
sizes
okay oh you know this guy who is that
you've seen him in the movies before
that's george clooney
so it's kind of an interesting picture
because here we have oh i think i know
her too she looks familiar
i can't remember her name she was in the
movie fargo
okay so anyway it's funny that their
famous
famous actor and famous actress they're
watching the movies
which is the moving picture movies these
two people
are famous in the movies and they're in
the theater right now
watching a movie so let's go see a movie
there's many expressions we can use with
movie let's
go see a movie go see
a movie let's go see a movie okay
also we say movie theater movie
theater okay a movie theater
and that's where we see moving pictures
moving pictures
is not really a common expression
anymore it was a common expression when
movies were first invented
because people didn't know what movies
were they knew what pictures were
and when the pictures moved very quickly
they called it
moving pictures oh it's moving pictures
but nowadays we don't say moving
pictures often
we say movie okay of course
movies are very important in our lives
we probably watch
many movies every week every month maybe
even every day
don't watch too many movies though it's
not good for your brain
okay take it easy okay now let's
go over the vocabulary exercises now how
well do we remember
those words that we just learned here we
need to complete each sentence with a
word
from the box so we have many words in
the box here
and we have sentences on this and the
other slides
that we need to fill in the blank with
the proper
word let's review the words real quick
the words in the box are
first g sorry excuse me genius
genius that's better distant
distant transform
transform disguised
disguised next is hero
hero then villain villain
next is ruthless ruthless
and then violent violent
okay those are our words where do we put
these words in the sentence
which word goes with which sentence
let's find out number one
though she is little although she is
little
even though she is little she is
a peep in mathematics
okay now this is kind of a strange thing
because it doesn't really matter that
she's
little i mean maybe it's because maybe
you could say even though she is young
she's little maybe she's a little girl
right that they're talking about
you don't expect young children to be
very what
in mathematics very smart yeah you don't
expect
children to be very smart in mathematics
because most children are just learning
mathematics
but if you find a child
or some children or a girl a little boy
who is very good at mathematics we can
call them what they're very smart right
they are a genius in mathematics so even
though she's a little girl
even though she's young she is a genius
in mathematics okay we don't expect that
so that's why we say though even though
it's not expected
it's unexpected number two the
beep businessman made little children
work too much that's a bad businessman
terrible he doesn't care about the
feelings or the
the welfare of other people it doesn't
care about other people
he just wants to get what he wants this
is really bad
bad person what did we say about what is
a
what do we just what word do we use to
describe
people who don't care about other people
we say that those people are ruthless
they are ruthless so a ruthless
businessman
will make children work too much
actually
just making children work is ruthless
right
and especially too much that's terrible
businessmen shouldn't make children work
at all
children should not work they should
have fun and go to school
right they're learning they shouldn't
work until they get older
right making children work is ruthless
number three the king beep himself
as a beggar this is interesting so
imagine
you sometimes you hear about this in
stories right
you hear about a king who wants to know
about the ordinary people
so he wants to change his appearance so
nobody will recognize him
he wants to what he wants to
disguise himself so the king disguised
himself
as a beggar so he could go out
and talk to people normally so they
wouldn't think that oh he's a king you
know
they would tell him what they really
thought okay sometimes we hear stories
like that that's a common
idea in many stories okay number four
the magician magician a person who
performs magic tricks
the magician has an ability to beep
into a bird what would a magician do
what can a magician do it can do
something into a bird
to perhaps change himself
into a bird to change his form into a
bird and fly away
that would be a great magic trick right
well what word here means to
change into something else of course
you're probably looking at this word
here transform
the magician has an ability to transform
into a bird to change himself into a
bird
that's pretty cool five usually the beep
in a movie does not die now think about
that
uh we're talking about characters in the
movie right we talked about there are
good characters
and there are bad characters the good
characters are the heroes
the bad characters are the villains
which ones
usually don't die especially in movies
like superheroes and things like that
of course the hero in a movie does
not die usually doesn't say always
usually in some movies yes the hero dies
those are sad movies right
but usually action movies or superhero
movies
the hero doesn't die the hero wins right
that's what the movie's about
good always wins in those movies but the
hero
does not die okay next one
even though he is a nice person so even
though despite
something unexpected right even though
he is a nice person he usually plays the
beep
in movies so he's a nice person
but even though he's a nice person
despite that fact
something unexpected he usually plays
and that means he acts as what in the
movies so we're looking for something
opposite of a nice person what's the
opposite of the nice person or the good
guy
the opposite of course is the villain
right even though
he is a nice person he usually plays the
villain
in movies so he's a nice actor the
the person is nice but he plays a bad
guy in the movies
right he plays a villain that makes
sense okay
seven i don't like to watch tv because
most
programs are too what are too
what are most programs on television
maybe somebody doesn't like it
uh maybe they don't like the people are
always fighting or that maybe somebody
dies
what kind of movies are those those are
violent movies
i don't like to watch tv because most
programs are too
violent that person doesn't like the
violence on the movies
number eight she lives in a beep city
it's the only word left okay of course
we're looking at this word
she lives in a distant city that means
far away more a while right
she lives in a far away city it's funny
in korean when i was learning korean
it's very
uh chimichanga because in korean you
know you say
yogi is here chogi is over there
and is over there right so that would be
chocky we'd be like distance
right far away distance okay
that's just it's just kind of funny
chemiseo okay
okay so that wraps up the vocabulary
section of this lesson let's take a
short break we'll come back
and we'll do the reading

00:53
let's take a look though at the
00:54
vocabulary so let's start
00:56
whoa i'm sorry we went from a very
00:58
exciting picture
01:00
to a very difficult picture what is all
01:01
this math and look at this boy he looks

01:46
next one far away so if that city is
01:49
really far away we can say
01:51
it is distant distant uh
01:55
if you see mountains very far away those
01:57
mountains
01:58
are distant distant far away
02:01
okay next one to change into something
02:05
else okay so a long time ago this was
02:09
all rock
02:10
but water and wind came through and
02:13
changed these rocks into very
02:15
interesting shapes
02:16
what happened they transformed
02:20
trans trans of course is a cross and
02:25
form is shape so across different shapes
02:28
transform this is a verb to change
02:32
to change into something else remember
02:35
the movie uh
02:36
poster we saw at the beginning
02:39
transformers
02:40
of course those are about robots that
02:42
can change their
02:43
shape into something else and we'll
02:46
read about that in the passage whoa
02:50
there's a funny guy right he's a funny
02:52
looking guy
02:54
maybe he wants to hide himself to hide
02:56
yourself by looking
02:58
different right he doesn't look like
03:00
that he doesn't have such big eyebrows
03:02
he doesn't have a big nose or a mustache
03:04
but he put it on maybe he wants to hide
03:08
who he really is so what is he doing
03:11
he is disguising to disguise
03:15
yourself right also disguise can be a
03:19
noun
03:19
also right but here it is a verb
03:23
in this definition to hide
03:27
that is a verb but it can also be a noun
03:30
the glasses with the big nose and the
03:32
mustache
03:33
that is a disguise so you put on a
03:36
disguise
03:37
you can put on put on
03:41
a disguise so you can use
03:45
disguise as a verb or as a noun
03:49
if you use it as a noun you can say put
03:51
on
03:52
a disguise put on a disguise and
03:54
disguise can be closed
03:55
too if you want to hide your true
03:58
identity you don't want
04:00
anybody to know who you are put on a
04:03
disguise
04:04
disguise yourself okay next one
04:08
hey you know this guy right that's
04:10
spider-man the amazing spider-man
04:13
he's the good character in a story
04:16
now unfortunately in many stories
04:18
spider-man people think he's a bad guy
04:20
right but spider-man's really he's
04:22
really the good guy
04:23
who is he he's the hero he's the hero of
04:28
the movie
04:28
the good character the person who does
04:32
good things and helps other people that
04:35
is the hero
04:36
of the movie okay now movies usually
04:40
have heroes
04:41
but then also movies have somebody who
04:43
fights against the hero
04:45
the main bad character in a story
04:48
and these are the people who fight
04:50
against the hero right
04:52
so movies of course many movies show
04:55
conflict
04:56
you have good and evil good guys
04:59
bad guys and they're fighting against
05:00
each other well the heroes are the good
05:03
guys
05:03
who are the bad guys what do we call
05:05
them we can call them
05:07
villain a villain is a bad guy
05:10
so villains are the bad characters
05:13
in movies the villains are
05:17
fighting the heroes of the movies who
05:20
wins
05:21
well usually in a movie the hero wins
05:24
right
05:24
usually especially uh movies about uh
05:27
superheroes
05:28
the good guy always wins doesn't he or
05:31
she there's lots of
05:32
uh female heroes too super uh action or
05:36
superheroes that are female as well
05:38
so it's the the good guy or the good
05:41
girl
05:41
who always wins in these types of movies
05:44
right but the villains usually lose
05:48
okay not caring if you hurt
05:52
others so if somebody doesn't care if
05:54
you hurt others
05:55
this is a bad thing right it's not a
05:58
good thing it's what the villain would
06:00
do right
06:00
the villains are ruthless ruthless
06:04
is an adjective it's an adjective
06:07
it's used to describe
06:10
what somebody is like what is their
06:13
personality like
06:15
what is their character like they are
06:17
ruthless
06:18
it means they don't care if they hurt
06:20
other people
06:21
that's very bad right a person who
06:24
doesn't care if they hurt other people
06:26
right they just do what they want they
06:28
want to get what they want they don't
06:29
care
06:30
about other people that's ruthless it's
06:32
bad that would be a villain
06:34
a bad guy or a bad character okay
06:39
using great force to hurt others like in
06:42
this movie oh
06:43
no he's kicking him right there that
06:45
looks very painful right
06:47
so what is this this is violent this is
06:50
violent
06:51
action violent is also an adjective
06:55
it's an oh that's so strange j isn't it
06:57
it's an
06:58
adjective violent it's a violent scene
07:02
it's a violent act he's a violent
07:06
person so we use violent as an adjective
07:09
in front of a noun to show that
07:12
something or somebody's using great
07:14
force
07:15
to hurt other people it's a violent
07:17
movie
07:18
it's a violent uh scene it's a violent
07:21
person okay so violent is an adjective
07:25
to describe person place thing okay
07:28
next one do you remember this movie i
07:31
don't know if you remember it it's a
07:33
little bit old
07:34
right maybe before you were born i don't
07:36
know it's
07:37
of course called robocop it was a cool
07:39
movie the first one right
07:40
uh there's been others too but this is
07:43
robocop
07:44
he's a he's a he's part human part
07:48
robot right part machine but he's human
07:51
inside and this of course is just a
07:53
robot
07:54
to show as a main part now to show as a
07:57
main part
07:58
we are to feature so robocop features
08:01
this character here and also this is the
08:04
bad guy in the end of the movie
08:06
this is also a part of the movie to show
08:08
as a main part
08:10
the main part of a movie especially is
08:13
the feature
08:14
for example this is usually used to
08:17
describe
08:17
the actors or actresses in a movie for
08:20
example you can say
08:21
the new movie is going to feature brad
08:24
pitt
08:25
that means brad pitt will be a main part
08:27
of the movie
08:29
you could also say the new movie will
08:31
feature new york
08:33
which means a place new york the setting
08:35
the place will be a main part
08:37
of the movie so to show as a main part
08:40
it can be a person it can be a thing
08:42
it can be you know a machine an animal
08:45
it could be
08:46
anything really it's just a main part of
08:48
something it
08:49
features that thing or that person
08:52
okay what we use to speak
08:56
and write what am i using right now to
08:59
speak to you
09:00
i'm using english right what is english
09:04
english is
09:04
a language of course you normally
09:08
use korean to speak and write that
09:11
is your language right now you are
09:14
learning
09:14
a different language you're learning
09:17
english
09:17
so language is what we use to speak
09:20
and write notice that this is not
09:23
language
09:24
be careful these i would call these
09:28
letters not alphabets
09:32
don't say these are alphabets these are
09:34
letters
09:35
alphabet is the whole set of letters
09:38
from a
09:39
to z in english the whole set
09:42
is alphabet individual
09:45
symbols are letters okay and
09:49
of course letters are part of language
09:51
these letters
09:52
are part of the english language these
09:55
letters are a feature of the english
09:58
language
09:59
okay so yeah we work the vocabulary
10:01
together okay next one
10:04
oh what happened to him i think he's
10:07
drinking too much right
10:08
very dangerous okay well he fell down
10:11
and he's probably pushing the horn a
10:14
short high-pitched
10:15
sound so maybe goes beep beep right
10:18
look at that that's the word some words
10:21
in english
10:23
are the same as the sound
10:26
that they make right so if you push the
10:29
horn
10:30
on a car right the horn on a car it
10:32
makes a high-pitched sound
10:34
we say that sound is a beep and that's
10:36
what it sounds like it's beep
10:39
the sound and the word are the same
10:42
sometimes we hear that right sometimes
10:44
that's true
10:45
in english okay so that's a good word
10:47
there
10:48
to show that the the word and the sound
10:50
are the same thing
10:51
okay next to be successful
10:55
in a game or fight ah what happened here
10:58
we can see what happened very
11:00
easily oh these two uh
11:03
ladies were playing a game one person is
11:06
going to do what
11:07
one person is going to win the other
11:09
person
11:10
is going to lose so
11:14
who do you think won who do you think
11:17
lost
11:18
when is a past is a irregular verb so i
11:21
said one
11:22
win won one who won
11:26
she won obviously who lost oh
11:29
lose lost lost right
11:33
she lost okay so somebody will win
11:36
somebody will lose after the game who
11:38
won
11:39
she won she lost okay so
11:42
which team won that team won that team
11:45
lost
11:46
okay next word wow this is a big
11:49
airplane right
11:50
this is a plane driven by jet engines
11:53
jet engine is here and here now
11:56
a long time ago there were no jet
12:00
engines planes used propellers now i'm
12:03
not a very good
12:04
artist so i'm trying to draw these it
12:07
looks like a flower doesn't it
12:08
but these things would spin really fast
12:11
and they would catch the air
12:12
and push the plane forward and these
12:15
were called
12:16
propellers propeller
12:19
a propeller plane so we said propeller
12:21
plane or
12:22
sometimes we will say prop plane
12:25
propeller plane or prop plane
12:26
but then of course technology improves
12:28
now we have jet engines
12:30
what kind of plane do we call that we
12:33
call that a
12:33
jet so it's really the same thing a jet
12:36
engine it's a jet
12:37
if it has a jet engine oh there's two
12:39
more over here too
12:41
don't forget those okay if it has a jet
12:44
engine
12:44
it is a jet okay
12:48
oh that's too bad what happened here a
12:51
problem or
12:52
difficulty right there's a problem with
12:54
the engine
12:55
in this car so a problem or difficulty
12:58
is trouble
12:59
now this is a good uh picture to show
13:02
for this word
13:03
because in this case we can say she
13:06
has car
13:09
trouble and that's a very common
13:12
expression right
13:13
she has car trouble do you have car
13:15
trouble if your car breaks down
13:18
it's a very common expression do you
13:20
have car trouble
13:21
or she has car trouble okay interesting
13:25
expression
13:26
okay next a vehicle for carrying
13:29
goods now a vehicle for carrying goods
13:32
this is a special type of vehicle
13:34
you would not call this a car it's not a
13:37
car
13:37
it's a truck a truck is
13:41
a big vehicle and it has a big
13:44
area a big space you can put many things
13:47
inside whether it's
13:48
rocks like this or sometimes it's all
13:51
closed and it has a roof
13:52
and it has a door back here and you can
13:55
put stuff inside
13:56
that's a tractor trailer okay
14:00
that carries you know like electronic
14:02
goods from the factory to the store
14:05
or many other types of products okay
14:07
there's many different kinds of trucks
14:09
also a pickup truck which is smaller one
14:13
person uses
14:14
and they can put their furniture or
14:16
their tools in the back of the truck
14:17
and drive to the job but it's much
14:19
smaller trucks are different shapes and
14:22
sizes
14:23
okay oh you know this guy who is that
14:27
you've seen him in the movies before
14:29
that's george clooney
14:30
so it's kind of an interesting picture
14:32
because here we have oh i think i know
14:34
her too she looks familiar
14:36
i can't remember her name she was in the
14:38
movie fargo
14:40
okay so anyway it's funny that their
14:42
famous
14:43
famous actor and famous actress they're
14:45
watching the movies
14:46
which is the moving picture movies these
14:50
two people
14:50
are famous in the movies and they're in
14:53
the theater right now
14:55
watching a movie so let's go see a movie
14:58
there's many expressions we can use with
15:01
movie let's
15:02
go see a movie go see
15:05
a movie let's go see a movie okay
15:09
also we say movie theater movie
15:12
theater okay a movie theater
15:16
and that's where we see moving pictures
15:19
moving pictures
15:20
is not really a common expression
15:21
anymore it was a common expression when
15:23
movies were first invented
15:25
because people didn't know what movies
15:27
were they knew what pictures were
15:29
and when the pictures moved very quickly
15:32
they called it
15:33
moving pictures oh it's moving pictures
15:35
but nowadays we don't say moving
15:37
pictures often
15:38
we say movie okay of course
15:41
movies are very important in our lives
15:44
we probably watch
15:45
many movies every week every month maybe
15:48
even every day
15:49
don't watch too many movies though it's
15:51
not good for your brain
15:52
okay take it easy okay now let's
15:57
go over the vocabulary exercises now how
16:00
well do we remember
16:01
those words that we just learned here we
16:04
need to complete each sentence with a
16:06
word
16:06
from the box so we have many words in
16:09
the box here
16:10
and we have sentences on this and the
16:12
other slides
16:14
that we need to fill in the blank with
16:16
the proper
16:17
word let's review the words real quick
16:19
the words in the box are
16:21
first g sorry excuse me genius
16:25
genius that's better distant
16:29
distant transform
16:33
transform disguised
16:37
disguised next is hero
16:41
hero then villain villain
16:46
next is ruthless ruthless
16:50
and then violent violent
16:53
okay those are our words where do we put
16:56
these words in the sentence
16:58
which word goes with which sentence
17:00
let's find out number one
17:02
though she is little although she is
17:06
little
17:06
even though she is little she is
17:09
a peep in mathematics
17:13
okay now this is kind of a strange thing
17:15
because it doesn't really matter that
17:17
she's
17:18
little i mean maybe it's because maybe
17:21
you could say even though she is young
17:23
she's little maybe she's a little girl
17:24
right that they're talking about
17:26
you don't expect young children to be
17:29
very what
17:30
in mathematics very smart yeah you don't
17:33
expect
17:34
children to be very smart in mathematics
17:37
because most children are just learning
17:39
mathematics
17:40
but if you find a child
17:44
or some children or a girl a little boy
17:47
who is very good at mathematics we can
17:50
call them what they're very smart right
17:52
they are a genius in mathematics so even
17:56
though she's a little girl
17:57
even though she's young she is a genius
18:01
in mathematics okay we don't expect that
18:04
so that's why we say though even though
18:07
it's not expected
18:08
it's unexpected number two the
18:11
beep businessman made little children
18:14
work too much that's a bad businessman
18:18
terrible he doesn't care about the
18:21
feelings or the
18:23
the welfare of other people it doesn't
18:25
care about other people
18:26
he just wants to get what he wants this
18:28
is really bad
18:30
bad person what did we say about what is
18:32
a
18:33
what do we just what word do we use to
18:35
describe
18:36
people who don't care about other people
18:39
we say that those people are ruthless
18:43
they are ruthless so a ruthless
18:45
businessman
18:46
will make children work too much
18:48
actually
18:50
just making children work is ruthless
18:52
right
18:53
and especially too much that's terrible
18:56
businessmen shouldn't make children work
18:57
at all
18:58
children should not work they should
19:00
have fun and go to school
19:01
right they're learning they shouldn't
19:03
work until they get older
19:05
right making children work is ruthless
19:09
number three the king beep himself
19:12
as a beggar this is interesting so
19:15
imagine
19:16
you sometimes you hear about this in
19:18
stories right
19:19
you hear about a king who wants to know
19:21
about the ordinary people
19:23
so he wants to change his appearance so
19:26
nobody will recognize him
19:28
he wants to what he wants to
19:32
disguise himself so the king disguised
19:35
himself
19:36
as a beggar so he could go out
19:40
and talk to people normally so they
19:42
wouldn't think that oh he's a king you
19:44
know
19:44
they would tell him what they really
19:45
thought okay sometimes we hear stories
19:47
like that that's a common
19:49
idea in many stories okay number four
19:53
the magician magician a person who
19:55
performs magic tricks
19:58
the magician has an ability to beep
20:01
into a bird what would a magician do
20:06
what can a magician do it can do
20:08
something into a bird
20:10
to perhaps change himself
20:13
into a bird to change his form into a
20:16
bird and fly away
20:17
that would be a great magic trick right
20:20
well what word here means to
20:22
change into something else of course
20:25
you're probably looking at this word
20:26
here transform
20:27
the magician has an ability to transform
20:31
into a bird to change himself into a
20:34
bird
20:34
that's pretty cool five usually the beep
20:38
in a movie does not die now think about
20:42
that
20:42
uh we're talking about characters in the
20:44
movie right we talked about there are
20:46
good characters
20:47
and there are bad characters the good
20:49
characters are the heroes
20:50
the bad characters are the villains
20:52
which ones
20:54
usually don't die especially in movies
20:56
like superheroes and things like that
20:58
of course the hero in a movie does
21:02
not die usually doesn't say always
21:05
usually in some movies yes the hero dies
21:08
those are sad movies right
21:10
but usually action movies or superhero
21:13
movies
21:13
the hero doesn't die the hero wins right
21:15
that's what the movie's about
21:17
good always wins in those movies but the
21:20
hero
21:21
does not die okay next one
21:24
even though he is a nice person so even
21:27
though despite
21:29
something unexpected right even though
21:31
he is a nice person he usually plays the
21:34
beep
21:34
in movies so he's a nice person
21:38
but even though he's a nice person
21:39
despite that fact
21:41
something unexpected he usually plays
21:45
and that means he acts as what in the
21:48
movies so we're looking for something
21:49
opposite of a nice person what's the
21:51
opposite of the nice person or the good
21:53
guy
21:54
the opposite of course is the villain
21:56
right even though
21:58
he is a nice person he usually plays the
22:00
villain
22:01
in movies so he's a nice actor the
22:05
the person is nice but he plays a bad
22:07
guy in the movies
22:08
right he plays a villain that makes
22:10
sense okay
22:12
seven i don't like to watch tv because
22:15
most
22:15
programs are too what are too
22:19
what are most programs on television
22:21
maybe somebody doesn't like it
22:23
uh maybe they don't like the people are
22:25
always fighting or that maybe somebody
22:27
dies
22:28
what kind of movies are those those are
22:30
violent movies
22:32
i don't like to watch tv because most
22:34
programs are too
22:36
violent that person doesn't like the
22:38
violence on the movies
22:40
number eight she lives in a beep city
22:43
it's the only word left okay of course
22:46
we're looking at this word
22:47
she lives in a distant city that means
22:50
far away more a while right
22:54
she lives in a far away city it's funny
22:56
in korean when i was learning korean
22:58
it's very
22:59
uh chimichanga because in korean you
23:01
know you say
23:02
yogi is here chogi is over there
23:05
and is over there right so that would be
23:08
chocky we'd be like distance
23:10
right far away distance okay
23:13
that's just it's just kind of funny
23:15
chemiseo okay
23:17
okay so that wraps up the vocabulary
23:19
section of this lesson let's take a
23:21
short break we'll come back
23:22
and we'll do the reading
