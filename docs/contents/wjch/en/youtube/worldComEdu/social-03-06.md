hello everyone
welcome back to american textbook
reading series
we're studying social studies book 3
unit
6 today and unit 6 is titled
working for justice so in this unit
we will discover how people work for
justice
and about some famous people who
have worked for justice in the past and
they're heroes today
okay well as usual let's begin with the
vocabulary
okay our first word is democracy
democracy is a type of government
it's a government system in which people
can choose their leaders by vote
we all live in a democracy remember in a
previous lesson
we talked about voting and choosing
leaders when you vote
you cast your ballot to choose your
leader
that is a democratic system it is a
democracy
okay next we have threat
this is an important word threat is
something that causes danger or
harm it's something that could cause
danger
um a threat yet it says causes danger
harm
but it's really a threat is before the
harm
or the injury has occurred it's more
like danger
right it is a threat if you say
something is a threat you're saying it
has the possibility
of causing harm right
it is dangerous it is a threat
so it hasn't done it yet but it is a
threat
maybe it's done it in the past but it is
a threat okay
so that's a threat justice
justice is a very important idea
right and we usually represented by this
picture here
you see the scales the scales of justice
right
and that means being fair in treating
people why do we use scales
because well it's a it's kind of a
capitalist idea i guess if
if you go to buy something right and you
say
well one ounce of gold is
worth this amount of goods
so you have to balance it right so if
it's balanced it's fair
if you pay too much that's not fair
if you pay too little it's not fair to
the other person right you want
something to be fair so justice is about
being
fair fair means treating each other
in an appropriate way so that each
person is satisfied with what they have
each person feels that okay i wasn't
taken
advantage of take advantage of
is the opposite of being just take
ad vantage
if you hire somebody to do something for
you
and they do the job like work on your
house or something like that
and then they do a good job and you
don't pay them
you took advantage of them right
you didn't treat them fairly okay
so justice is the system of being fair
and treating people
making sure that everybody has the same
or equal chances opportunities
and that they are treated well for their
actions
okay and that everybody is treated the
same that's another part of justice
is that everybody has the same
opportunities
and they have the same punishments for
the same actions if they do something
bad
they're all treated the same way okay if
they're if they do something good then
they're all rewarded
in the same way that's what justice is
kind of a big idea
injustice okay so we just talked about
justice
now we have injustice remember in means
not so
not just not fair
it's injustice being unfair in treating
people
in this case again we have the scales so
in this case we're saying that
well actually this is an interesting
picture because we have women
are are more valuable than men in this
usually it's the other way around
that men are treated more valuable than
women you know many people complain that
men are paid more than women for example
but in this scale
this shows that women because they're
heavier they they have more
value than men right so but they should
be equal
right it should be equal opportunity uh
uh
chances for opportunity should be equal
among men and women
among different races it doesn't matter
who you are
what you believe uh what ethnic
background you have
it doesn't matter everybody should be
treated equally and if the system
does not do that then it is
injustice it is not just
it is not just it is an injustice okay
next
allow allow means to permit to to permit
or to let
someone do something you're in class the
teacher is talking
you have to go to the bathroom what do
you do you raise your hand and say
teacher
may i go to the bathroom and the teacher
will say yes
you are allowed to go to the bathroom i
give you permission
i'm going to let you go to the bathroom
so to allow somebody say okay it's no
problem
i allow you to do that okay
next we have march march means to walk
forward with regular steps now usually
when we think of march we think of
soldiers in an army right
and they're they're having some kind of
parade right and they're marching to
or you know they're just going from one
place to another by foot
march means to go some place by foot but
march also has another meaning and it's
important meaning here
and you can see it in the picture so
march
is a political event where many people
get together and they all
walk to a certain place that has some
significance
for example
nowadays early 2020 right there are many
people
marching in america and all over the
world because of
what they see injustice in the police
system so they get together and they
march to city hall
or they march to the police station to
show
protest now we do have a video but this
is a different kind of march
this is this is a parade this isn't a
political march
this is more of kind of like a parade
these guys are just marching through
uh the street and it's more for a
festive or
celebration occasion but marches can
also be
political and they are usually like a
type of political
protest a march is like a political
protest
against injustice okay so that's a march
especially when many people get together
and they walk from one place to another
to show
that they are not happy with the system
okay here we have a couple of ideas
about
um injustice and justice how people
stand up
against injustice in democracy in a
democracy
so in a democracy people have the right
to protest they have the freedom of
speech we talked about that before
they also have the freedom to s to
show their opinion their displeasure if
leaders in the community whether it's at
the city
the county the state or the national
government
if people feel that the system is not
just is not fair to everybody they have
different ways of showing their
uh displeasure with that and they will
protest
by the way these are all protests i use
that word before so let me put it here
pro test now a protest
well to protest means to say i don't
like it i don't agree with it
a protest a noun is when many people get
together
and say look we don't like this this is
not right
we disagree with this that is a protest
there are many different types of
protests there are many different ways
that people
will protest first of all um
if there is a a threat to justice for
example we see a picture here
and i believe it's representing
minorities minority is
usually a racial or sexual group that is
not
the majority they're a small part of the
population
sometimes they are not treated fairly
the the way that the system treats them
is not just
so they feel that this is a threat to
justice
a threat to justice means that society
is not being
fair in the way that it treats everybody
so what happens they will gather
together
they gather together people will
assemble and that's another important
right
the right to assembly right
to sorry about my t's right to
assemble assemble means to gather
assemble gather together many people
getting together in groups
it's a gathering of people that's an
assembly the right to assemble
is an important right in the u.s
constitution it means that people
have the right to get together
especially in protest
to voice their opinion what do they do
they will march on the streets
right again we see another political
protest they'll hold
signs and say this isn't right whatever
the issue is they'll say this is wrong
right or we should do this and they will
get together and they will march on the
street
and they will also speak as they're
marching they may stop someplace at city
hall
or they might stop in front of a police
station or
another place where an act of injustice
happen
and they will have loudspeakers right
and they will speak
out against speak out against
something if you see something that is
not right you think this is not right
you should speak out against it say look
this isn't right we shouldn't do this
right so speaking out against injustice
right people will speak out against
injustice
okay good also who are some famous
people that spoke out
against injustice in the past now
this is american history u.s history uh
two famous people uh who are very
influential and they're heroes to the
civil rights movement i should write
that down civil
civil rights civil rights has to do with
the fact that
civil rights that everybody has the same
rights in a society
i mentioned before minorities minorities
are
people who are grouped together because
of the color of their skin
their ethnic background right or it
could also be
gender based right maybe they have a
different gender than normal right or
they have different gender
preferences than what is the normal and
they might these these are
what we call minorities but everybody
has the same rights
in a civil society we call these civil
rights
nobody should be discriminated against
whether it's access to public services
access to you know normal businesses
opportunities at the workplace or in
government
right everybody should have the same uh
treatment
so let's take a look at two famous
people first of all we have rosa parks
rosa parks is a very famous person
almost every american school child every
american school child learns about rosa
parks
in school what did rosa parks do
well she was a woman who lived in
alabama she was a black woman
who lived in alabama a long time ago
this is i think early 1960s
in the 1960s and the laws in alabama
alabama is a state in the southern part
of the united states
it's part of the what we call the deep
south deep
that's a d not a p deep south
and in the south in america
american history is tragic in some parts
and unfortunately there was slavery and
this was happening in the south it
didn't happen in the north it happened
in the south and so the south has been
traditionally hopefully not these days i
i'm
sure things have changed i hope for the
better obviously for the brother things
have changed a lot but it still has some
ways to go
and in the south traditionally blacks
were
discriminated against very strongly
and one of the rules in alabama even in
the 1960s this is a hundred years after
the civil war
and the ending of slavery 100 years
still
black people were supposed to sit in the
back of the bus
they couldn't sit in the front of the
bus that was for white people
obviously this is terrible this is
unjust so
she bravely refused she came on the bus
i think the story was that she was tired
and she
she didn't want to give up her seat she
sat in the front of the bus then another
person came on a white person said hey
what are you doing here
you should be sitting in the back of the
bus i think the bus driver also got
involved the bus driver said
hey go back to the back of the bus she
said no
okay because it's not just it's not
right for somebody to be told where to
sit on a bus
just because they have a different skin
color that is completely wrong
so she bravely refused to give up her
seat
and her action changed the unfair laws
people saw that and she was arrested
for this and it got into the news and
many people saw this
excuse me and many people say this is
not fair this is unjust
and they came out to support her and it
started
to uh help move well there was already a
movement but it started to
uh snowball to make a bigger movement
and her action actually caused a larger
action
that martin luther king jr got involved
in now martin luther king jr
he is a a pastor he is a religious
leader
but he is also a very good speaker and
he
was involved in this incident with rosa
parks he led many protests
and black people refused to to ride the
buses in that alabama town and all
across
alabama and they said no we're not going
to ride the bus
we're gonna drive ourselves and our
friends has a car a friend of a friend
has a car
we'll take the car or we'll walk and so
the city bus
company was in danger of losing a lot of
money and finally they won
and then those laws about um you know
you have to sit here because you're
black or you have to sit here because
you're white or you can't sit here
because you're white
those were abolished those were done
away with so
martin luther king jr very famous
american he wanted
african americans to be treated equally
of course everybody does
but he was very vocal and he was very
brave
because at this time he was a black man
in the deep south
where people used violence against
people like martin luther
king jr in fact he lost his life he was
killed
by an assassin somebody a white person
shot him a white man
shot him in the late 1960s
but martin luther king led peaceful
marches and he made speeches he's very
famous for his i have a dream speech
that he gave he's a very famous very
powerful person
and it's also interesting he took a lot
of his ideas from gandhi
who also fought against injustice in the
in
india under the british colonial
system so martin luther king studied
gandhi and used many of his ideas
especially his ideas about
non-violent protest okay i'm getting a
very long big subject but anyway
rosa parks and martin luther king jr
they're two
very important people in american
history who fought for
civil rights not just for black people
but for all
racial groups is very important okay
let's take a look at the reading
okay we have the reading here so as
usual
repeat after me or you know use a
pronunciation
in your head silently or repeat out loud
practice the pronunciation
concentrate on the words from the
vocabulary you ready here we go
in a democracy all people are equal
and should be treated with fairness
in the united states when there is a
threat to justice
people can join together to stand up
against injustice
however things were a little different
in the 1960s
the government didn't allow the equal
treatment
of african americans just because of
their skin color
excuse me
faced with such unfairness african
americans
stood up for themselves they marched on
the streets to show their feelings and
spoke out against this unequal
treatment unequal unjust
okay martin luther king jr
was one of the most important leaders in
the fight
finally the unequal treatment against
african americans
was ended by a new law passed in 1964.
that law 1964 was the civil rights
civil rights
act and it guaranteed
under law the fair
treatment of everybody no matter what
their race no matter what their sex
no matter what their gender identity
civil rights act very important
1964. okay now
people believe that everybody deserves
to be treated with fairness
and it is the basic value of american
society
now it is a basic value of american
society but unfortunately sometimes
some people don't
act accordingly and this is a terrible
thing
and so now we still have you know still
even in 2020
we still have people marching and
protesting against
injustice against people based on race
and also against people uh based on
gender identities
so it's important it's a very important
uh
passage uh even though and everybody
people believe most people do i mean
when you think about it
you know over 90 percent of people in
the world are good
and they believe that everybody should
be treated with fairness
just those few people who don't and
sometimes it takes a long time
or it takes a big change in
institutions and laws and practices
of organizations to make sure that
everybody is treated fairly and
sometimes people don't realize
that some groups are not being treated
fairly and it takes
some events to change that okay
so let's take a look at the organization
for this reading passage
okay so how is this reading passage
organized well here we see
sequence sequence again means first
second third so what happens in order
what happens first
what happens next what happens next so
let's take a look and this is talking
about the civil rights movement
in america during the 1960s
in the u.s the government didn't allow
the beep
treatment of peep okay so in the passage
remember
it wasn't one of the vocabulary words
but it's it has to do with justice
making sure everything is
fair and equal for everybody
so didn't allow the equal treatment you
could use
fair there but equal is also commonly
used
equal treatment also fair treatment
these words are usually found
together equal treatment under the law
for example but you can also say fair
treatment but usually you say
everybody should have equal treatment
under the law
who didn't get treatment didn't allow
the equal treatment of
who which group were we talking about
in the passage african americans
african
americans
so the government didn't allow the equal
treatment of african americans
they beep on the streets when people
protest on the streets they gather
together and they walk from one place to
another
what do we call that we call that a
march right so they marched
they marched
on the streets to speak out beep this
equal treatment remember
i i highlighted these three words before
the reading speak
out against you speak out against
something means you protest it
speak out against you speak out against
this unequal treatment so when you speak
out against something
it means you say something you see look
that's not right
right so you should speak out against it
those three words are usually found
together
speak out against something say it is
not right
we shouldn't do that we should speak out
against it
speak out against it okay
the unequal treatment was ended well by
law
the unequal treatment was ended by a new
law passed in 1964.
no that's controversial was it ended
really
it was made punishable by law it didn't
actually end
right people continued to do it and
still up to this day
we see people still treat other people
unequally however there is now a law
that says you cannot do it and if you do
do this
either individually or as an
organization
you will be punished under the law and
that's the way it should be but of
course the way it really should be is
that
we don't have to have a law like this
that we respect each other and treat
everybody equally
regardless okay so there's an
interesting passage
our interesting unit working for justice
we learned some very important words
and i hope you've also learned the
importance of treating everybody equally
whether you know it doesn't matter what
a person's
races it doesn't matter what a person's
sex is
it doesn't matter what a person's
beliefs are
right everybody should be treated
equally under a just
system that is just that is
justice if if people are not treated
equally or fairly that is
injustice so always work for justice do
you see something that is not right
speak out against it okay well that's
our lesson for today
thank you for studying with me and we'll
see you in the next one take care
everybody
bye

hello everyone
00:09
welcome back to american textbook
00:11
reading series
00:13
we're studying social studies book 3
00:15
unit
00:16
6 today and unit 6 is titled
00:19
working for justice so in this unit
00:23
we will discover how people work for
00:26
justice
00:28
and about some famous people who
00:31
have worked for justice in the past and
00:34
they're heroes today
00:36
okay well as usual let's begin with the
00:38
vocabulary
00:40
okay our first word is democracy
00:43
democracy is a type of government
00:45
it's a government system in which people
00:48
can choose their leaders by vote
00:52
we all live in a democracy remember in a
00:55
previous lesson
00:57
we talked about voting and choosing
00:59
leaders when you vote
01:00
you cast your ballot to choose your
01:03
leader
01:03
that is a democratic system it is a
01:06
democracy
01:08
okay next we have threat
01:11
this is an important word threat is
01:13
something that causes danger or
01:16
harm it's something that could cause
01:18
danger
01:19
um a threat yet it says causes danger
01:23
harm
01:23
but it's really a threat is before the
01:26
harm
01:27
or the injury has occurred it's more
01:30
like danger
01:31
right it is a threat if you say
01:32
something is a threat you're saying it
01:35
has the possibility
01:37
of causing harm right
01:40
it is dangerous it is a threat
01:44
so it hasn't done it yet but it is a
01:47
threat
01:48
maybe it's done it in the past but it is
01:50
a threat okay
01:51
so that's a threat justice
01:55
justice is a very important idea
01:58
right and we usually represented by this
02:01
picture here
02:02
you see the scales the scales of justice
02:05
right
02:06
and that means being fair in treating
02:08
people why do we use scales
02:11
because well it's a it's kind of a
02:14
capitalist idea i guess if
02:15
if you go to buy something right and you
02:18
say
02:19
well one ounce of gold is
02:22
worth this amount of goods
02:25
so you have to balance it right so if
02:28
it's balanced it's fair
02:30
if you pay too much that's not fair
02:34
if you pay too little it's not fair to
02:36
the other person right you want
02:37
something to be fair so justice is about
02:39
being
02:40
fair fair means treating each other
02:44
in an appropriate way so that each
02:46
person is satisfied with what they have
02:49
each person feels that okay i wasn't
02:52
taken
02:52
advantage of take advantage of
02:56
is the opposite of being just take
02:59
ad vantage
03:05
if you hire somebody to do something for
03:08
you
03:08
and they do the job like work on your
03:11
house or something like that
03:13
and then they do a good job and you
03:14
don't pay them
03:16
you took advantage of them right
03:20
you didn't treat them fairly okay
03:23
so justice is the system of being fair
03:26
and treating people
03:27
making sure that everybody has the same
03:30
or equal chances opportunities
03:34
and that they are treated well for their
03:37
actions
03:38
okay and that everybody is treated the
03:40
same that's another part of justice
03:42
is that everybody has the same
03:44
opportunities
03:45
and they have the same punishments for
03:48
the same actions if they do something
03:50
bad
03:50
they're all treated the same way okay if
03:53
they're if they do something good then
03:55
they're all rewarded
03:57
in the same way that's what justice is
03:59
kind of a big idea
04:02
injustice okay so we just talked about
04:06
justice
04:06
now we have injustice remember in means
04:08
not so
04:10
not just not fair
04:13
it's injustice being unfair in treating
04:16
people
04:17
in this case again we have the scales so
04:19
in this case we're saying that
04:20
well actually this is an interesting
04:22
picture because we have women
04:24
are are more valuable than men in this
04:26
usually it's the other way around
04:28
that men are treated more valuable than
04:29
women you know many people complain that
04:32
men are paid more than women for example
04:34
but in this scale
04:35
this shows that women because they're
04:37
heavier they they have more
04:39
value than men right so but they should
04:42
be equal
04:43
right it should be equal opportunity uh
04:45
uh
04:46
chances for opportunity should be equal
04:48
among men and women
04:49
among different races it doesn't matter
04:51
who you are
04:52
what you believe uh what ethnic
04:55
background you have
04:56
it doesn't matter everybody should be
04:58
treated equally and if the system
05:00
does not do that then it is
05:03
injustice it is not just
05:06
it is not just it is an injustice okay
05:09
next
05:10
allow allow means to permit to to permit
05:13
or to let
05:14
someone do something you're in class the
05:17
teacher is talking
05:18
you have to go to the bathroom what do
05:20
you do you raise your hand and say
05:22
teacher
05:22
may i go to the bathroom and the teacher
05:25
will say yes
05:26
you are allowed to go to the bathroom i
05:28
give you permission
05:29
i'm going to let you go to the bathroom
05:31
so to allow somebody say okay it's no
05:34
problem
05:34
i allow you to do that okay
05:38
next we have march march means to walk
05:41
forward with regular steps now usually
05:43
when we think of march we think of
05:45
soldiers in an army right
05:46
and they're they're having some kind of
05:48
parade right and they're marching to
05:51
or you know they're just going from one
05:52
place to another by foot
05:55
march means to go some place by foot but
05:57
march also has another meaning and it's
05:59
important meaning here
06:00
and you can see it in the picture so
06:03
march
06:04
is a political event where many people
06:08
get together and they all
06:10
walk to a certain place that has some
06:12
significance
06:13
for example
06:16
nowadays early 2020 right there are many
06:19
people
06:20
marching in america and all over the
06:21
world because of
06:23
what they see injustice in the police
06:25
system so they get together and they
06:27
march to city hall
06:28
or they march to the police station to
06:30
show
06:31
protest now we do have a video but this
06:34
is a different kind of march
06:35
this is this is a parade this isn't a
06:38
political march
06:39
this is more of kind of like a parade
06:41
these guys are just marching through
06:43
uh the street and it's more for a
06:46
festive or
06:47
celebration occasion but marches can
06:50
also be
06:50
political and they are usually like a
06:53
type of political
06:54
protest a march is like a political
06:58
protest
06:59
against injustice okay so that's a march
07:02
especially when many people get together
07:04
and they walk from one place to another
07:06
to show
07:07
that they are not happy with the system
07:10
okay here we have a couple of ideas
07:12
about
07:13
um injustice and justice how people
07:16
stand up
07:17
against injustice in democracy in a
07:20
democracy
07:21
so in a democracy people have the right
07:24
to protest they have the freedom of
07:27
speech we talked about that before
07:28
they also have the freedom to s to
07:31
show their opinion their displeasure if
07:35
leaders in the community whether it's at
07:38
the city
07:39
the county the state or the national
07:42
government
07:43
if people feel that the system is not
07:46
just is not fair to everybody they have
07:50
different ways of showing their
07:53
uh displeasure with that and they will
07:56
protest
07:57
by the way these are all protests i use
07:59
that word before so let me put it here
08:01
pro test now a protest
08:06
well to protest means to say i don't
08:09
like it i don't agree with it
08:11
a protest a noun is when many people get
08:14
together
08:14
and say look we don't like this this is
08:17
not right
08:18
we disagree with this that is a protest
08:22
there are many different types of
08:24
protests there are many different ways
08:25
that people
08:26
will protest first of all um
08:30
if there is a a threat to justice for
08:33
example we see a picture here
08:35
and i believe it's representing
08:36
minorities minority is
08:38
usually a racial or sexual group that is
08:41
not
08:41
the majority they're a small part of the
08:44
population
08:45
sometimes they are not treated fairly
08:48
the the way that the system treats them
08:50
is not just
08:52
so they feel that this is a threat to
08:55
justice
08:56
a threat to justice means that society
08:59
is not being
09:00
fair in the way that it treats everybody
09:02
so what happens they will gather
09:04
together
09:04
they gather together people will
09:06
assemble and that's another important
09:08
right
09:09
the right to assembly right
09:13
to sorry about my t's right to
09:16
assemble assemble means to gather
09:19
assemble gather together many people
09:22
getting together in groups
09:23
it's a gathering of people that's an
09:26
assembly the right to assemble
09:28
is an important right in the u.s
09:30
constitution it means that people
09:32
have the right to get together
09:33
especially in protest
09:35
to voice their opinion what do they do
09:37
they will march on the streets
09:39
right again we see another political
09:41
protest they'll hold
09:42
signs and say this isn't right whatever
09:45
the issue is they'll say this is wrong
09:47
right or we should do this and they will
09:50
get together and they will march on the
09:52
street
09:53
and they will also speak as they're
09:54
marching they may stop someplace at city
09:56
hall
09:57
or they might stop in front of a police
09:59
station or
10:00
another place where an act of injustice
10:03
happen
10:03
and they will have loudspeakers right
10:06
and they will speak
10:07
out against speak out against
10:11
something if you see something that is
10:13
not right you think this is not right
10:15
you should speak out against it say look
10:18
this isn't right we shouldn't do this
10:20
right so speaking out against injustice
10:23
right people will speak out against
10:25
injustice
10:26
okay good also who are some famous
10:30
people that spoke out
10:31
against injustice in the past now
10:34
this is american history u.s history uh
10:37
two famous people uh who are very
10:41
influential and they're heroes to the
10:42
civil rights movement i should write
10:44
that down civil
10:46
civil rights civil rights has to do with
10:50
the fact that
10:52
civil rights that everybody has the same
10:55
rights in a society
10:56
i mentioned before minorities minorities
10:59
are
11:00
people who are grouped together because
11:02
of the color of their skin
11:03
their ethnic background right or it
11:06
could also be
11:06
gender based right maybe they have a
11:11
different gender than normal right or
11:13
they have different gender
11:15
preferences than what is the normal and
11:18
they might these these are
11:19
what we call minorities but everybody
11:22
has the same rights
11:24
in a civil society we call these civil
11:26
rights
11:27
nobody should be discriminated against
11:29
whether it's access to public services
11:32
access to you know normal businesses
11:36
opportunities at the workplace or in
11:39
government
11:39
right everybody should have the same uh
11:42
treatment
11:44
so let's take a look at two famous
11:46
people first of all we have rosa parks
11:49
rosa parks is a very famous person
11:51
almost every american school child every
11:54
american school child learns about rosa
11:56
parks
11:57
in school what did rosa parks do
12:00
well she was a woman who lived in
12:02
alabama she was a black woman
12:04
who lived in alabama a long time ago
12:07
this is i think early 1960s
12:09
in the 1960s and the laws in alabama
12:12
alabama is a state in the southern part
12:15
of the united states
12:16
it's part of the what we call the deep
12:19
south deep
12:21
that's a d not a p deep south
12:25
and in the south in america
12:28
american history is tragic in some parts
12:32
and unfortunately there was slavery and
12:34
this was happening in the south it
12:36
didn't happen in the north it happened
12:37
in the south and so the south has been
12:40
traditionally hopefully not these days i
12:43
i'm
12:43
sure things have changed i hope for the
12:45
better obviously for the brother things
12:47
have changed a lot but it still has some
12:49
ways to go
12:50
and in the south traditionally blacks
12:53
were
12:53
discriminated against very strongly
12:57
and one of the rules in alabama even in
12:59
the 1960s this is a hundred years after
13:01
the civil war
13:02
and the ending of slavery 100 years
13:04
still
13:06
black people were supposed to sit in the
13:08
back of the bus
13:09
they couldn't sit in the front of the
13:11
bus that was for white people
13:13
obviously this is terrible this is
13:15
unjust so
13:16
she bravely refused she came on the bus
13:19
i think the story was that she was tired
13:20
and she
13:21
she didn't want to give up her seat she
13:22
sat in the front of the bus then another
13:24
person came on a white person said hey
13:26
what are you doing here
13:27
you should be sitting in the back of the
13:28
bus i think the bus driver also got
13:30
involved the bus driver said
13:31
hey go back to the back of the bus she
13:34
said no
13:35
okay because it's not just it's not
13:38
right for somebody to be told where to
13:40
sit on a bus
13:41
just because they have a different skin
13:43
color that is completely wrong
13:45
so she bravely refused to give up her
13:48
seat
13:49
and her action changed the unfair laws
13:51
people saw that and she was arrested
13:55
for this and it got into the news and
13:57
many people saw this
13:59
excuse me and many people say this is
14:02
not fair this is unjust
14:04
and they came out to support her and it
14:06
started
14:07
to uh help move well there was already a
14:09
movement but it started to
14:11
uh snowball to make a bigger movement
14:15
and her action actually caused a larger
14:18
action
14:18
that martin luther king jr got involved
14:21
in now martin luther king jr
14:23
he is a a pastor he is a religious
14:26
leader
14:27
but he is also a very good speaker and
14:30
he
14:31
was involved in this incident with rosa
14:33
parks he led many protests
14:35
and black people refused to to ride the
14:37
buses in that alabama town and all
14:39
across
14:40
alabama and they said no we're not going
14:42
to ride the bus
14:43
we're gonna drive ourselves and our
14:44
friends has a car a friend of a friend
14:46
has a car
14:47
we'll take the car or we'll walk and so
14:49
the city bus
14:51
company was in danger of losing a lot of
14:53
money and finally they won
14:55
and then those laws about um you know
14:58
you have to sit here because you're
15:00
black or you have to sit here because
15:01
you're white or you can't sit here
15:02
because you're white
15:04
those were abolished those were done
15:06
away with so
15:07
martin luther king jr very famous
15:09
american he wanted
15:11
african americans to be treated equally
15:13
of course everybody does
15:14
but he was very vocal and he was very
15:16
brave
15:18
because at this time he was a black man
15:20
in the deep south
15:22
where people used violence against
15:24
people like martin luther
15:26
king jr in fact he lost his life he was
15:29
killed
15:30
by an assassin somebody a white person
15:32
shot him a white man
15:33
shot him in the late 1960s
15:36
but martin luther king led peaceful
15:39
marches and he made speeches he's very
15:41
famous for his i have a dream speech
15:44
that he gave he's a very famous very
15:47
powerful person
15:48
and it's also interesting he took a lot
15:50
of his ideas from gandhi
15:52
who also fought against injustice in the
15:55
in
15:55
india under the british colonial
15:58
system so martin luther king studied
16:00
gandhi and used many of his ideas
16:02
especially his ideas about
16:04
non-violent protest okay i'm getting a
16:06
very long big subject but anyway
16:08
rosa parks and martin luther king jr
16:11
they're two
16:12
very important people in american
16:14
history who fought for
16:16
civil rights not just for black people
16:18
but for all
16:19
racial groups is very important okay
16:24
let's take a look at the reading
16:29
okay we have the reading here so as
16:31
usual
16:32
repeat after me or you know use a
16:35
pronunciation
16:36
in your head silently or repeat out loud
16:39
practice the pronunciation
16:40
concentrate on the words from the
16:42
vocabulary you ready here we go
16:47
in a democracy all people are equal
16:50
and should be treated with fairness
16:55
in the united states when there is a
16:57
threat to justice
16:58
people can join together to stand up
17:02
against injustice
17:05
however things were a little different
17:08
in the 1960s
17:10
the government didn't allow the equal
17:13
treatment
17:14
of african americans just because of
17:16
their skin color
17:19
excuse me
17:22
faced with such unfairness african
17:25
americans
17:26
stood up for themselves they marched on
17:30
the streets to show their feelings and
17:32
spoke out against this unequal
17:35
treatment unequal unjust
17:38
okay martin luther king jr
17:42
was one of the most important leaders in
17:44
the fight
17:46
finally the unequal treatment against
17:49
african americans
17:50
was ended by a new law passed in 1964.
17:56
that law 1964 was the civil rights
18:00
civil rights
18:03
act and it guaranteed
18:07
under law the fair
18:10
treatment of everybody no matter what
18:12
their race no matter what their sex
18:15
no matter what their gender identity
18:17
civil rights act very important
18:19
1964. okay now
18:22
people believe that everybody deserves
18:24
to be treated with fairness
18:26
and it is the basic value of american
18:29
society
18:30
now it is a basic value of american
18:33
society but unfortunately sometimes
18:35
some people don't
18:38
act accordingly and this is a terrible
18:41
thing
18:42
and so now we still have you know still
18:44
even in 2020
18:46
we still have people marching and
18:47
protesting against
18:49
injustice against people based on race
18:52
and also against people uh based on
18:55
gender identities
18:57
so it's important it's a very important
19:00
uh
19:00
passage uh even though and everybody
19:04
people believe most people do i mean
19:06
when you think about it
19:07
you know over 90 percent of people in
19:09
the world are good
19:10
and they believe that everybody should
19:12
be treated with fairness
19:13
just those few people who don't and
19:16
sometimes it takes a long time
19:18
or it takes a big change in
19:21
institutions and laws and practices
19:24
of organizations to make sure that
19:27
everybody is treated fairly and
19:28
sometimes people don't realize
19:30
that some groups are not being treated
19:32
fairly and it takes
19:33
some events to change that okay
19:37
so let's take a look at the organization
19:40
for this reading passage
19:43
okay so how is this reading passage
19:45
organized well here we see
19:47
sequence sequence again means first
19:50
second third so what happens in order
19:53
what happens first
19:54
what happens next what happens next so
19:56
let's take a look and this is talking
19:58
about the civil rights movement
19:59
in america during the 1960s
20:03
in the u.s the government didn't allow
20:05
the beep
20:06
treatment of peep okay so in the passage
20:10
remember
20:11
it wasn't one of the vocabulary words
20:13
but it's it has to do with justice
20:15
making sure everything is
20:16
fair and equal for everybody
20:20
so didn't allow the equal treatment you
20:23
could use
20:23
fair there but equal is also commonly
20:27
used
20:27
equal treatment also fair treatment
20:30
these words are usually found
20:34
together equal treatment under the law
20:37
for example but you can also say fair
20:39
treatment but usually you say
20:41
everybody should have equal treatment
20:43
under the law
20:44
who didn't get treatment didn't allow
20:46
the equal treatment of
20:48
who which group were we talking about
20:51
in the passage african americans
20:57
african
21:00
americans
21:06
so the government didn't allow the equal
21:08
treatment of african americans
21:11
they beep on the streets when people
21:14
protest on the streets they gather
21:15
together and they walk from one place to
21:17
another
21:18
what do we call that we call that a
21:19
march right so they marched
21:22
they marched
21:27
on the streets to speak out beep this
21:30
equal treatment remember
21:31
i i highlighted these three words before
21:33
the reading speak
21:34
out against you speak out against
21:37
something means you protest it
21:39
speak out against you speak out against
21:44
this unequal treatment so when you speak
21:47
out against something
21:48
it means you say something you see look
21:50
that's not right
21:52
right so you should speak out against it
21:54
those three words are usually found
21:56
together
21:57
speak out against something say it is
21:59
not right
22:00
we shouldn't do that we should speak out
22:03
against it
22:04
speak out against it okay
22:07
the unequal treatment was ended well by
22:10
law
22:11
the unequal treatment was ended by a new
22:13
law passed in 1964.
22:16
no that's controversial was it ended
22:18
really
22:21
it was made punishable by law it didn't
22:24
actually end
22:25
right people continued to do it and
22:26
still up to this day
22:28
we see people still treat other people
22:31
unequally however there is now a law
22:34
that says you cannot do it and if you do
22:37
do this
22:37
either individually or as an
22:40
organization
22:41
you will be punished under the law and
22:43
that's the way it should be but of
22:44
course the way it really should be is
22:46
that
22:46
we don't have to have a law like this
22:48
that we respect each other and treat
22:49
everybody equally
22:51
regardless okay so there's an
22:53
interesting passage
22:54
our interesting unit working for justice
22:56
we learned some very important words
22:59
and i hope you've also learned the
23:00
importance of treating everybody equally
23:03
whether you know it doesn't matter what
23:05
a person's
23:07
races it doesn't matter what a person's
23:09
sex is
23:10
it doesn't matter what a person's
23:12
beliefs are
23:13
right everybody should be treated
23:15
equally under a just
23:17
system that is just that is
23:20
justice if if people are not treated
23:23
equally or fairly that is
23:24
injustice so always work for justice do
23:27
you see something that is not right
23:29
speak out against it okay well that's
23:31
our lesson for today
23:33
thank you for studying with me and we'll
23:34
see you in the next one take care
23:36
everybody
23:42
bye
