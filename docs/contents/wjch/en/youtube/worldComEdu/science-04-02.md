hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading my name is brian stewart
and today we're going over science book
four
lesson two how seeds are
scattered so in this unit we will
discover
what kinds of seeds there
are and of course how seeds
are scattered
as usual we start with the vocabulary
and you may have noticed a difficult
word
in the unit title how seeds are
scattered
well what does scatter mean scatter
means
to throw or drop objects
over an area usually a wide
area think about your room right if you
come home
and you take off your clothes you know
you change from your school clothes
to your home comfortable clothes and
how do you do it you just throw your
shirt over there maybe your pants over
there
your belt over there you scatter your
clothes all over the room
okay hopefully don't do that mom doesn't
like it
right so but to scatter is to throw
objects or things
in a wide area not very neatly like the
picture
shows we see seeds are just tossed on
the ground
randomly okay
next we have blow
right how strong can you blow if you're
young
you can blow really strongly usually if
you have a birthday cake
you have many candles on your cake and
you blow them out
we believe that if you blow out all the
candles in one blow
your wish will come true so to blow is
to make something move
by a current of air of course we blow
but it blowing doesn't mean that a
person
or animal has to do it it could just
happen in nature
naturally from the wind right if there's
a strong wind
the wind blows and we have a video
to show what's going on here also this
is very important because as you can see
the boy
he's blowing on a flower and i just want
to point this out before we watch the
video
what kind of flower is that that is
called
a dan oops sorry d-a-n
dan de lion it's not a lion
it's a dandelion a dandelion is that
type of flower
let's watch a video of the dandelion
being blown
in the wind here we go there's the
dandelion
let's watch as the wind blows it
okay here we go there's the wind the
wind comes along and
blows it now what happened all these
little things here
actually you see these little pieces
here those are seeds
right the wind comes along and blows the
dandelion seeds
and they are scattered okay and that's
how
the plant reproduces itself because new
plants will grow
by the way it's very interesting that
people will say
dandelions you can predict the weather
by looking at the dandelion if it's nice
weather
the dandelion has a nice ball shape like
we saw at the beginning of the video
but if it's if there's high humidity
it's going to rain then the petals of
the dandelion
close up over the flower so if you see
they say oh
it's going to rain interesting okay
next word is land now if something is
flying in the air
like a dandelion seed that's blowing in
the wind
after a while the wind will stop or get
weaker and the dandelion seed will come
down
and touch back onto land onto land
and then we say that it lands so land is
a noun
right it's the the ground that you stand
on
but land is also a verb because we use
it to say that something that was flying
comes back to the ground so to come to
the ground
after moving in the air to come
back to the ground to land
okay next we have ripe
ripe is an important word especially if
you're going to eat fruit
or other types of plants or vegetables
right
ripe ripe means that it is fully grown
and ready to eat so you don't want to
eat
an unripe apple ugh that doesn't taste
very good
you want to eat a ripe apple or a ripe
orange
or ripe corn whatever the plant is that
you eat it should be ripe that means
it's
fully grown and it is ready to
eat our next word
is stick now stick has a couple of
different meanings of course
you can say i have a stick right you
have a tree branch
and you wave around that's a noun but
we're not talking about that definition
here
stick here is a verb
it's a verb in this definition it means
for one object to become attached
to another and you can see in this
picture
oh you you're probably familiar with
this situation
you walk in the woods or you walk in a
grassy
area where there's a lot of plants and
after you go through you look down at
your pants
or your socks especially and you see
these little
things that are sticking to your socks
or your pants and of course that's what
it means to stick to
to attach to something tape is sticky
right if you want to stick two things
together
use a piece of tape if or glue glue is
also
sticky so stick can be used as a noun
it can be used as a verb it can also be
used as an
adjective sticky it
is sticky glue is sticky tape
is sticky parts of plants are sticky
they will stick to you okay
next drop drop of course just means to
let
something fall or or to fall by itself
of course it's a verb if you just let go
of something it will drop
of course when the earlier example we
looked at with the dandelion seeds
they're
flying in the wind the wind is blowing
so the dandelion seed is
is flying in the air what happens when
the wind stops
the dandelion seed drops to the ground
it lands okay so to drop means to fall
from the air or fall from a high place
down to a lower place it can mean to
land
if the object winds up on the ground
okay so there's different kinds of
landings there's good landings and
not so good landings okay anyway to drop
burr now we talked about stit remember
when we saw that picture for stick we
saw those little pieces of the plant
that sticks to your socks
they're really hard to get out aren't
they well what
part of the plant is that we call that
a bur burr burr little hooks on a
seed that can stick to things and of
course many plants
will do this they'll have the little
tiny hooks very small but if you look at
them carefully
especially with a magnifying glass you
can see that the little parts of the
part of the plant they're like little
hooks and those hooks
grab on to your clothing and they really
like socks
but also pants and they'll grab on to
those
and stick with you as you move so burr
is little hooks on a seed
that can stick to things and those are
the things
that are on your socks or your pants
and your shoes okay
fur well first we had burr now we have
fur
er the ending sound of r
bur fur in this case fur
of course is the hair that covers some
animals okay i've got kind of hairy arms
but
don't call this fur right it's not that
thick
i don't have that much hair but if it's
a really a lot of hair
growing really close together and you
cannot see the skin
we call that fur look at your dog maybe
you have a pet dog
or a cat or a mouse that
if you look at the animal they have very
thick hair growing out of their skin
we call that fur it's the hair that
covers
some animals not all animals but many
animals especially
mammals have fur but not humans
we don't have fur so don't don't say
that about a human being it's not nice
okay anyway good okay so those are our
words
for the lesson
okay the first idea for this lesson of
course is how
are seeds scattered when you think about
plants
don't really move right i mean they grow
in one spot
sure they can move this way but they
don't really move from where they're
growing out of the ground they don't
have legs they can't get up and walk
around
so how do plants produce other plants if
if they
make smaller plants right where they are
well then they will die
right because there's not enough land or
water or sunlight in that
area around the plant to support many
plants so this
the plants have to have some way to
spread out
and to grow in other areas so to do that
they need to scatter their seeds how do
they do that
well we saw one example when we saw the
video
we saw the dandelion will scatter their
seeds by the wind
and these seeds can travel very far and
make new plants
far away from the mother plant or the
parent plant
okay now seeds can also be scattered by
water right and here we see this looks
like a coconut right a coconut and a
little
um coconut plant a baby coconut tree is
growing out of the coconut
while it's floating in the water and
that's why coconuts will float on
water because uh the plant if it drops a
coconut hits water
it might float to another island and
then
the new coconut tree will will grow on
another island
far away from the parent plant so that's
interesting
also seeds are scattered by animals
you'll notice we talked about fur we
talked about
burr and we talked about stick right so
animals when they walk through plants
they the seeds might stick to the
animal's fur
and then drop off later and that's how
they are scattered
in nature and that's how plants can
spread out
and make sure that they you know
propagate or
propagate reproduce over larger areas
of land okay the second idea
is different kinds of seeds and we can
kind of get the idea of different kinds
of seeds
when we talked about the first main idea
how seeds are scattered right
we see that some are small and they can
blow in the wind while others might be
heavier or bigger but they can float on
water so there are many different
kinds of seeds in this
chart we can see three different types
of seeds
and we can see also how they are
scattered
for example we first we have the maple
tree
the maple tree has interesting looking
seeds
of course that's not the whole seed the
seeds are down in here right
but they have a covering or or
case i guess you could say that looks
like
wings right they don't flap it's not
like a butterfly
actually moving the wings they don't
move but they're shaped
very well so that the wind can catch
them and the seeds of the maple tree are
scattered through the air because
in that with that shape the wind can
easily pick them up
and carry them very far away and that's
how the maple tree
will spread or scatter its
seeds next we have the water lily
and water lily we can see right away
okay those seeds are scattered by water
but the water lily has seeds that
float on lakes float means to stay at
the surface of the water
so the seeds will stay at the surface of
the water if they sink they'll get stuck
on the bottom right
so they stay on the surface of the water
and they can move to different parts of
the lake
or even down rivers to other parts or
other
areas of land and that's how the water
lily will spread
its seeds now chestnut tree
of course you know chestnuts i think in
korean you say pam
right those are delicious especially in
the
late fall around november and even in
december
people will cook chestnuts on a fire
they're very warm and they're very
delicious aren't they
but of course when you see the chestnut
that you see
that you get from the store or from the
people selling them on the street
they're brown they have a thick smooth
uh
covering right but that's not how they
grow in the tree
on the tree they have another skin
around them with
it looks like fur and that's actually
little birds it's a little hooks
and chestnut burrs right you can see
them here it looks like the hair here
but these have the little hooks on them
and they'll stick onto
the fur uh they'll stick on the fur
or feathers of animals so
fur of normal uh animal abnormal animals
of mammals or they get stuck on the
feathers
of birds and especially if you get stuck
on the feather bird you can travel very
far right because birds
will fly long distances and then they
fall off in another area
so different kinds of seeds will use
different types of techniques or
methods to spread out right maybe
they're light
and they're small so they can be carried
by the wind
maybe they're they might be larger but
they can float on water they're not
heavy they're very light so they float
on water
and some seeds even use little hooks to
stick onto
animals or birds that do move
and can move the seeds for them so it's
very interesting idea
okay now it's time for the reading so as
usual read along with me
or read along in your mind practice the
pronunciation
and focus on the vocabulary for this
lesson
are you ready let's begin
plants grow from seeds
it is difficult for a seed to grow
in the same space as its parent
if seeds are scattered they are more
likely to grow into new plants
seeds are scattered in many ways
the wind can blow seeds away from a
plant
whereas seed lands it might grow
into a new plant
sometimes the seeds are inside fruits
animals like to eat ripe fruit
sometimes birds take fruit from a plant
and fly away when they
land and eat the fruit the seeds fall
out
birds can scatter seeds over
a large area as we talked about
some seeds have burrs these seeds can
stick to an animal's fur
the animal moves around and the seeds
can
drop off the animal in different areas
seeds can be scattered this way
the wind and animals help scatter seeds
and so plants have more space to live in
okay that's the reading and it's
interesting as we talked about before
this reading kind of shows you how
plants
can continue to grow and how they can
make sure
that there's enough room for their
descendants or their babies if you will
to grow because as the reading pointed
out if
there's not enough area around the
mother or parent plant
to for more plants to grow it gets too
crowded
right there's not enough resources so
they have to spread out
okay how is this reading
organized now here we're looking at
cause and effect
and basically we have three different
causes and three different effects
that's what they're breaking this this
down into
the wind can be a cause the animals can
be a cause
and also seeds with burrs can be a cause
that's there are three causes here so
let's fill in the blanks
in this chart first we have the cause
and that results in an effect for what
is the cause
the cause is the wind can beep seeds
away from a plant so what do we talk
about remember this action right
what am i doing i am blowing so the wind
can
the wind can blow the wind can blow
seeds away from a plant that's the cause
what is the effect well the seeds
land in different
areas that's the effect and so seeds
have
new areas new a lot of resources they
have enough resources
to grow hopefully if they land in the
right area
okay next we have animals like to eat
beep fruit and move around so fruit is
our noun
right so we need some kind of adjective
to describe fruit
what kind of fruit do animals eat well
of course animals aren't going to eat
fruit that is not
ready to eat so they're going to eat
ripe fruit ripe means
ready to eat fully grown and ready to
eat
it doesn't always mean ready to eat i
mean some things can be ripe and you
don't eat them
it just means fully grown but when we're
talking about plants vegetables fruits
things like that
right means ready to eat
so animals eat ripe fruit they move
around
and then this way animals can do what
they can
scatter seeds they can scatter
scatter seeds
there's different ways in the in the
reading it said that birds when they eat
the fruit right the seeds fall out
other animals when they eat the fruit
the seed passes through their body
and comes out the other end when they go
to the bathroom so that's another way
that seeds
can be distributed or scattered
throughout
a large area didn't say that in the
reading but that's an interesting thing
that does happen okay seeds with burrs
can what okay remember if you're walking
through a field there's a lot of grass
those birds do what
they stick to you so seeds with burrs
can
stick
can stick to and
beep animals so stick to animals
and drop off animals
so first they stick of course after a
while maybe the
animal scratches you know or licks it or
rubs up against a tree
and the seed will drop off so
seeds with birds can stick to and drop
off
animals stick to animals and drop off
animals you don't have to repeat animals
right so it's the same
object you don't have to repeat it stick
to animals and drop off animals
stick to and drop off animals okay good
and of course the effect of that is that
the seeds will be scattered in fact
all of the effects are all of the
effects are that
seeds are scattered but through
different means
through different causes but it's always
the same effect
seeds are scattered plants have room to
grow more plants can grow
in a larger area and this is how plants
can spread out
and ensure the survival of their species
okay interesting interesting lesson so
if you ever wondered you know
how do plants spread out how do they you
know how do they
how does a forest grow don't all the
trees grow shouldn't all the trees grow
in the same area
no they're scattered around and now you
know how plants
can occupy large areas of land or even
travel to new lands
new islands or downstream or far away
by the wind so it's very interesting to
see how nature works okay
well that's your lesson for today thanks
for studying with me we'll see you next
time
take care bye-bye

hello everybody
00:10
welcome back to american textbook
00:12
reading my name is brian stewart
00:14
and today we're going over science book
00:16
four
00:17
lesson two how seeds are
00:20
scattered so in this unit we will
00:24
discover
00:25
what kinds of seeds there
00:28
are and of course how seeds
00:31
are scattered
00:35
as usual we start with the vocabulary
00:37
and you may have noticed a difficult
00:39
word
00:40
in the unit title how seeds are
00:43
scattered
00:44
well what does scatter mean scatter
00:48
means
00:48
to throw or drop objects
00:51
over an area usually a wide
00:55
area think about your room right if you
00:58
come home
00:59
and you take off your clothes you know
01:01
you change from your school clothes
01:03
to your home comfortable clothes and
01:06
how do you do it you just throw your
01:08
shirt over there maybe your pants over
01:10
there
01:11
your belt over there you scatter your
01:13
clothes all over the room
01:15
okay hopefully don't do that mom doesn't
01:17
like it
01:18
right so but to scatter is to throw
01:21
objects or things
01:22
in a wide area not very neatly like the
01:26
picture
01:26
shows we see seeds are just tossed on
01:29
the ground
01:30
randomly okay
01:33
next we have blow
01:38
right how strong can you blow if you're
01:42
young
01:42
you can blow really strongly usually if
01:45
you have a birthday cake
01:47
you have many candles on your cake and
01:50
you blow them out
01:52
we believe that if you blow out all the
01:54
candles in one blow
01:56
your wish will come true so to blow is
01:59
to make something move
02:01
by a current of air of course we blow
02:05
but it blowing doesn't mean that a
02:07
person
02:08
or animal has to do it it could just
02:11
happen in nature
02:12
naturally from the wind right if there's
02:15
a strong wind
02:16
the wind blows and we have a video
02:20
to show what's going on here also this
02:22
is very important because as you can see
02:24
the boy
02:25
he's blowing on a flower and i just want
02:28
to point this out before we watch the
02:29
video
02:30
what kind of flower is that that is
02:32
called
02:33
a dan oops sorry d-a-n
02:38
dan de lion it's not a lion
02:42
it's a dandelion a dandelion is that
02:45
type of flower
02:46
let's watch a video of the dandelion
02:49
being blown
02:50
in the wind here we go there's the
02:53
dandelion
02:54
let's watch as the wind blows it
03:00
okay here we go there's the wind the
03:02
wind comes along and
03:04
blows it now what happened all these
03:06
little things here
03:07
actually you see these little pieces
03:09
here those are seeds
03:11
right the wind comes along and blows the
03:14
dandelion seeds
03:15
and they are scattered okay and that's
03:18
how
03:19
the plant reproduces itself because new
03:22
plants will grow
03:24
by the way it's very interesting that
03:26
people will say
03:27
dandelions you can predict the weather
03:31
by looking at the dandelion if it's nice
03:34
weather
03:35
the dandelion has a nice ball shape like
03:38
we saw at the beginning of the video
03:40
but if it's if there's high humidity
03:43
it's going to rain then the petals of
03:46
the dandelion
03:48
close up over the flower so if you see
03:51
they say oh
03:52
it's going to rain interesting okay
03:56
next word is land now if something is
04:00
flying in the air
04:01
like a dandelion seed that's blowing in
04:04
the wind
04:05
after a while the wind will stop or get
04:08
weaker and the dandelion seed will come
04:11
down
04:12
and touch back onto land onto land
04:15
and then we say that it lands so land is
04:18
a noun
04:19
right it's the the ground that you stand
04:21
on
04:22
but land is also a verb because we use
04:25
it to say that something that was flying
04:28
comes back to the ground so to come to
04:31
the ground
04:31
after moving in the air to come
04:35
back to the ground to land
04:38
okay next we have ripe
04:42
ripe is an important word especially if
04:45
you're going to eat fruit
04:46
or other types of plants or vegetables
04:49
right
04:50
ripe ripe means that it is fully grown
04:53
and ready to eat so you don't want to
04:57
eat
04:57
an unripe apple ugh that doesn't taste
05:01
very good
05:02
you want to eat a ripe apple or a ripe
05:04
orange
05:05
or ripe corn whatever the plant is that
05:09
you eat it should be ripe that means
05:11
it's
05:11
fully grown and it is ready to
05:14
eat our next word
05:18
is stick now stick has a couple of
05:21
different meanings of course
05:22
you can say i have a stick right you
05:25
have a tree branch
05:26
and you wave around that's a noun but
05:28
we're not talking about that definition
05:30
here
05:31
stick here is a verb
05:35
it's a verb in this definition it means
05:38
for one object to become attached
05:42
to another and you can see in this
05:45
picture
05:45
oh you you're probably familiar with
05:48
this situation
05:50
you walk in the woods or you walk in a
05:52
grassy
05:53
area where there's a lot of plants and
05:55
after you go through you look down at
05:57
your pants
05:58
or your socks especially and you see
06:00
these little
06:01
things that are sticking to your socks
06:05
or your pants and of course that's what
06:07
it means to stick to
06:09
to attach to something tape is sticky
06:13
right if you want to stick two things
06:14
together
06:15
use a piece of tape if or glue glue is
06:19
also
06:19
sticky so stick can be used as a noun
06:23
it can be used as a verb it can also be
06:26
used as an
06:27
adjective sticky it
06:30
is sticky glue is sticky tape
06:34
is sticky parts of plants are sticky
06:37
they will stick to you okay
06:41
next drop drop of course just means to
06:46
let
06:46
something fall or or to fall by itself
06:49
of course it's a verb if you just let go
06:52
of something it will drop
06:54
of course when the earlier example we
06:56
looked at with the dandelion seeds
06:58
they're
06:59
flying in the wind the wind is blowing
07:01
so the dandelion seed is
07:02
is flying in the air what happens when
07:05
the wind stops
07:06
the dandelion seed drops to the ground
07:09
it lands okay so to drop means to fall
07:14
from the air or fall from a high place
07:17
down to a lower place it can mean to
07:20
land
07:21
if the object winds up on the ground
07:25
okay so there's different kinds of
07:27
landings there's good landings and
07:29
not so good landings okay anyway to drop
07:33
burr now we talked about stit remember
07:36
when we saw that picture for stick we
07:37
saw those little pieces of the plant
07:39
that sticks to your socks
07:40
they're really hard to get out aren't
07:42
they well what
07:44
part of the plant is that we call that
07:47
a bur burr burr little hooks on a
07:51
seed that can stick to things and of
07:53
course many plants
07:55
will do this they'll have the little
07:57
tiny hooks very small but if you look at
07:59
them carefully
08:00
especially with a magnifying glass you
08:02
can see that the little parts of the
08:05
part of the plant they're like little
08:06
hooks and those hooks
08:08
grab on to your clothing and they really
08:11
like socks
08:12
but also pants and they'll grab on to
08:14
those
08:15
and stick with you as you move so burr
08:18
is little hooks on a seed
08:20
that can stick to things and those are
08:23
the things
08:24
that are on your socks or your pants
08:27
and your shoes okay
08:30
fur well first we had burr now we have
08:33
fur
08:34
er the ending sound of r
08:37
bur fur in this case fur
08:41
of course is the hair that covers some
08:44
animals okay i've got kind of hairy arms
08:48
but
08:48
don't call this fur right it's not that
08:51
thick
08:52
i don't have that much hair but if it's
08:54
a really a lot of hair
08:56
growing really close together and you
08:58
cannot see the skin
09:00
we call that fur look at your dog maybe
09:02
you have a pet dog
09:04
or a cat or a mouse that
09:07
if you look at the animal they have very
09:10
thick hair growing out of their skin
09:12
we call that fur it's the hair that
09:15
covers
09:16
some animals not all animals but many
09:19
animals especially
09:20
mammals have fur but not humans
09:24
we don't have fur so don't don't say
09:26
that about a human being it's not nice
09:28
okay anyway good okay so those are our
09:31
words
09:31
for the lesson
09:38
okay the first idea for this lesson of
09:40
course is how
09:41
are seeds scattered when you think about
09:44
plants
09:45
don't really move right i mean they grow
09:47
in one spot
09:48
sure they can move this way but they
09:50
don't really move from where they're
09:51
growing out of the ground they don't
09:53
have legs they can't get up and walk
09:54
around
09:55
so how do plants produce other plants if
09:59
if they
10:00
make smaller plants right where they are
10:02
well then they will die
10:04
right because there's not enough land or
10:07
water or sunlight in that
10:11
area around the plant to support many
10:13
plants so this
10:14
the plants have to have some way to
10:16
spread out
10:18
and to grow in other areas so to do that
10:21
they need to scatter their seeds how do
10:24
they do that
10:25
well we saw one example when we saw the
10:28
video
10:29
we saw the dandelion will scatter their
10:31
seeds by the wind
10:32
and these seeds can travel very far and
10:35
make new plants
10:37
far away from the mother plant or the
10:40
parent plant
10:41
okay now seeds can also be scattered by
10:44
water right and here we see this looks
10:47
like a coconut right a coconut and a
10:49
little
10:50
um coconut plant a baby coconut tree is
10:54
growing out of the coconut
10:56
while it's floating in the water and
10:58
that's why coconuts will float on
11:00
water because uh the plant if it drops a
11:03
coconut hits water
11:04
it might float to another island and
11:07
then
11:08
the new coconut tree will will grow on
11:10
another island
11:11
far away from the parent plant so that's
11:14
interesting
11:16
also seeds are scattered by animals
11:20
you'll notice we talked about fur we
11:22
talked about
11:23
burr and we talked about stick right so
11:26
animals when they walk through plants
11:29
they the seeds might stick to the
11:31
animal's fur
11:32
and then drop off later and that's how
11:35
they are scattered
11:36
in nature and that's how plants can
11:39
spread out
11:40
and make sure that they you know
11:43
propagate or
11:44
propagate reproduce over larger areas
11:48
of land okay the second idea
11:52
is different kinds of seeds and we can
11:54
kind of get the idea of different kinds
11:56
of seeds
11:57
when we talked about the first main idea
11:59
how seeds are scattered right
12:01
we see that some are small and they can
12:03
blow in the wind while others might be
12:05
heavier or bigger but they can float on
12:07
water so there are many different
12:10
kinds of seeds in this
12:13
chart we can see three different types
12:15
of seeds
12:16
and we can see also how they are
12:18
scattered
12:19
for example we first we have the maple
12:22
tree
12:23
the maple tree has interesting looking
12:25
seeds
12:26
of course that's not the whole seed the
12:28
seeds are down in here right
12:30
but they have a covering or or
12:33
case i guess you could say that looks
12:36
like
12:36
wings right they don't flap it's not
12:39
like a butterfly
12:40
actually moving the wings they don't
12:42
move but they're shaped
12:44
very well so that the wind can catch
12:46
them and the seeds of the maple tree are
12:49
scattered through the air because
12:52
in that with that shape the wind can
12:54
easily pick them up
12:55
and carry them very far away and that's
12:58
how the maple tree
13:00
will spread or scatter its
13:03
seeds next we have the water lily
13:07
and water lily we can see right away
13:09
okay those seeds are scattered by water
13:12
but the water lily has seeds that
13:15
float on lakes float means to stay at
13:18
the surface of the water
13:20
so the seeds will stay at the surface of
13:22
the water if they sink they'll get stuck
13:23
on the bottom right
13:24
so they stay on the surface of the water
13:26
and they can move to different parts of
13:28
the lake
13:29
or even down rivers to other parts or
13:32
other
13:33
areas of land and that's how the water
13:35
lily will spread
13:37
its seeds now chestnut tree
13:40
of course you know chestnuts i think in
13:42
korean you say pam
13:43
right those are delicious especially in
13:46
the
13:46
late fall around november and even in
13:49
december
13:51
people will cook chestnuts on a fire
13:54
they're very warm and they're very
13:55
delicious aren't they
13:57
but of course when you see the chestnut
13:59
that you see
14:00
that you get from the store or from the
14:02
people selling them on the street
14:04
they're brown they have a thick smooth
14:07
uh
14:07
covering right but that's not how they
14:09
grow in the tree
14:11
on the tree they have another skin
14:13
around them with
14:14
it looks like fur and that's actually
14:17
little birds it's a little hooks
14:18
and chestnut burrs right you can see
14:22
them here it looks like the hair here
14:24
but these have the little hooks on them
14:26
and they'll stick onto
14:28
the fur uh they'll stick on the fur
14:31
or feathers of animals so
14:35
fur of normal uh animal abnormal animals
14:38
of mammals or they get stuck on the
14:41
feathers
14:42
of birds and especially if you get stuck
14:44
on the feather bird you can travel very
14:46
far right because birds
14:47
will fly long distances and then they
14:49
fall off in another area
14:51
so different kinds of seeds will use
14:54
different types of techniques or
14:58
methods to spread out right maybe
15:01
they're light
15:02
and they're small so they can be carried
15:04
by the wind
15:05
maybe they're they might be larger but
15:07
they can float on water they're not
15:09
heavy they're very light so they float
15:11
on water
15:12
and some seeds even use little hooks to
15:14
stick onto
15:16
animals or birds that do move
15:19
and can move the seeds for them so it's
15:22
very interesting idea
15:27
okay now it's time for the reading so as
15:29
usual read along with me
15:31
or read along in your mind practice the
15:33
pronunciation
15:34
and focus on the vocabulary for this
15:37
lesson
15:38
are you ready let's begin
15:41
plants grow from seeds
15:45
it is difficult for a seed to grow
15:48
in the same space as its parent
15:52
if seeds are scattered they are more
15:56
likely to grow into new plants
16:02
seeds are scattered in many ways
16:06
the wind can blow seeds away from a
16:10
plant
16:11
whereas seed lands it might grow
16:14
into a new plant
16:19
sometimes the seeds are inside fruits
16:23
animals like to eat ripe fruit
16:27
sometimes birds take fruit from a plant
16:31
and fly away when they
16:34
land and eat the fruit the seeds fall
16:37
out
16:38
birds can scatter seeds over
16:41
a large area as we talked about
16:47
some seeds have burrs these seeds can
16:51
stick to an animal's fur
16:54
the animal moves around and the seeds
16:57
can
16:57
drop off the animal in different areas
17:02
seeds can be scattered this way
17:08
the wind and animals help scatter seeds
17:12
and so plants have more space to live in
17:17
okay that's the reading and it's
17:19
interesting as we talked about before
17:21
this reading kind of shows you how
17:23
plants
17:25
can continue to grow and how they can
17:27
make sure
17:28
that there's enough room for their
17:32
descendants or their babies if you will
17:35
to grow because as the reading pointed
17:37
out if
17:38
there's not enough area around the
17:40
mother or parent plant
17:42
to for more plants to grow it gets too
17:44
crowded
17:45
right there's not enough resources so
17:47
they have to spread out
17:49
okay how is this reading
17:52
organized now here we're looking at
17:54
cause and effect
17:56
and basically we have three different
17:59
causes and three different effects
18:01
that's what they're breaking this this
18:03
down into
18:04
the wind can be a cause the animals can
18:06
be a cause
18:08
and also seeds with burrs can be a cause
18:11
that's there are three causes here so
18:13
let's fill in the blanks
18:14
in this chart first we have the cause
18:18
and that results in an effect for what
18:20
is the cause
18:21
the cause is the wind can beep seeds
18:24
away from a plant so what do we talk
18:28
about remember this action right
18:31
what am i doing i am blowing so the wind
18:34
can
18:35
the wind can blow the wind can blow
18:38
seeds away from a plant that's the cause
18:42
what is the effect well the seeds
18:45
land in different
18:49
areas that's the effect and so seeds
18:51
have
18:52
new areas new a lot of resources they
18:55
have enough resources
18:56
to grow hopefully if they land in the
18:59
right area
19:00
okay next we have animals like to eat
19:04
beep fruit and move around so fruit is
19:07
our noun
19:08
right so we need some kind of adjective
19:10
to describe fruit
19:11
what kind of fruit do animals eat well
19:14
of course animals aren't going to eat
19:17
fruit that is not
19:18
ready to eat so they're going to eat
19:21
ripe fruit ripe means
19:22
ready to eat fully grown and ready to
19:26
eat
19:27
it doesn't always mean ready to eat i
19:28
mean some things can be ripe and you
19:30
don't eat them
19:31
it just means fully grown but when we're
19:33
talking about plants vegetables fruits
19:35
things like that
19:36
right means ready to eat
19:39
so animals eat ripe fruit they move
19:42
around
19:43
and then this way animals can do what
19:46
they can
19:47
scatter seeds they can scatter
19:51
scatter seeds
19:54
there's different ways in the in the
19:56
reading it said that birds when they eat
19:58
the fruit right the seeds fall out
20:00
other animals when they eat the fruit
20:02
the seed passes through their body
20:04
and comes out the other end when they go
20:06
to the bathroom so that's another way
20:08
that seeds
20:09
can be distributed or scattered
20:12
throughout
20:13
a large area didn't say that in the
20:15
reading but that's an interesting thing
20:17
that does happen okay seeds with burrs
20:21
can what okay remember if you're walking
20:24
through a field there's a lot of grass
20:26
those birds do what
20:27
they stick to you so seeds with burrs
20:30
can
20:32
stick
20:34
can stick to and
20:38
beep animals so stick to animals
20:42
and drop off animals
20:46
so first they stick of course after a
20:48
while maybe the
20:49
animal scratches you know or licks it or
20:52
rubs up against a tree
20:54
and the seed will drop off so
20:57
seeds with birds can stick to and drop
20:59
off
21:00
animals stick to animals and drop off
21:03
animals you don't have to repeat animals
21:05
right so it's the same
21:06
object you don't have to repeat it stick
21:09
to animals and drop off animals
21:10
stick to and drop off animals okay good
21:14
and of course the effect of that is that
21:16
the seeds will be scattered in fact
21:18
all of the effects are all of the
21:21
effects are that
21:22
seeds are scattered but through
21:24
different means
21:26
through different causes but it's always
21:28
the same effect
21:30
seeds are scattered plants have room to
21:32
grow more plants can grow
21:34
in a larger area and this is how plants
21:37
can spread out
21:38
and ensure the survival of their species
21:42
okay interesting interesting lesson so
21:44
if you ever wondered you know
21:46
how do plants spread out how do they you
21:48
know how do they
21:49
how does a forest grow don't all the
21:50
trees grow shouldn't all the trees grow
21:52
in the same area
21:54
no they're scattered around and now you
21:56
know how plants
21:58
can occupy large areas of land or even
22:01
travel to new lands
22:03
new islands or downstream or far away
22:06
by the wind so it's very interesting to
22:09
see how nature works okay
22:12
well that's your lesson for today thanks
22:13
for studying with me we'll see you next
22:15
time
22:16
take care bye-bye
