in a neighborhood neighborhood is
the area in which you live
so in this lesson we will discover
different places in our neighborhood and
we will also talk about the types of
people
you can find in those places okay
well as usual let's start with the
vocabulary
our first vocabulary word is
park park it's a place a public area
public area what does that mean you have
a public area
and a private area a public area
everybody can go there there it's not
private property somebody's house where
they say you

public area all the citizens can go
there
all the people can go there you can go
there to rest right
lay in the sun you can walk you can play
you can walk your dog
ride your bike just be careful and
respect
other people in the park park is an
outdoor area okay that's our first word
the park second a zoo
great is this your favorite place to go
to
have you been to a zoo before if not
i recommend that you go to a zoo
soon you can see many different kinds of
animals for example in the picture we
can see a giraffe
can you see a giraffe in the park no
of course not that's crazy but you can
go to a zoo
and see giraffes and maybe lions
monkeys penguins
you can see all sorts of animals from
all
over the world so a zoo is a place
where various kinds of animals are kept
for people that's you and me to go
and see them okay so if you haven't been
to a zoo
i recommend it okay
our next word is cha it's actually two
words
child care center child care
center there are many centers
in your neighborhood child care is an
adjective
it's the type of center right you might
have a
sports center right but in this case we
have a
child care center so center
is a place that is made for a specific
purpose
in this case it's a place where
children are taken care of while their
parents
go to work if your mom and your
dad both work they're not
at home to take care of you and if
you're
too young to go to school you should go
to a
child care center sometimes people
call them day care center it's the same
thing child care center day care center
same thing so people other than your
parents
can take care of you while your parents
are busy
during the day okay so that's a child
care center our next word
is a type of person the type of person
here
is an artist artist
an artist is a person
who paints in this case
paints or draws or makes
some kind of art artists
are very creative they have a big
imagination
and they use that imagination to make
art whether it's painting or
making a sculpture or drawing
or whatever they're artists
okay next
we have a word improve now this
is a verb it talks about
an action to make
something better than before when you
improve something you make it better
than it was before now you can also
improve yourself every day
you can learn something new and that's
how you
improve yourself so good word right
okay let's continue
next we have avenue
avenue now an avenue we can also say
it's a street but there are many
kinds of street and avenue
is a wide street in a city
right it's a nice
street maybe trees lots of
well lots of cars in some cities though
avenues can be a little smaller
but they have many trees and in a nice
neighborhood
it's an avenue we can also call it a
street
we can call it a road some streets are
boulevards boulevard is a very wide
avenue
in a city so an avenue it's just a wide
street in a city
it's another word for street there are
many
kinds of streets okay
next we have another type of
person this type of person is
a scientist a scientist
notice the white lab coat and the gloves
sometimes they wear protective glasses
because sometimes scientists do
experiments
with dangerous chemicals right just a
scientist is
someone who is looking for more
knowledge
they are constantly improving
their mind their knowledge so a person
a scientist is a person who studies
science but really it's a person who
studies
nature and things that happen
in the natural world and they want to
know
why how right they want to know these
questions
maybe you want to know these questions
maybe you will grow up
to be a scientist one day okay
next we have an architect oh that's a
difficult word
repeat after me
architect architect an
architect is a person who designs
buildings
they don't make the buildings they
design the building
so if you like to draw and you like big
buildings
maybe you can become an architect
you can draw and plan buildings
and then many people will build
a building based on your design
pretty cool huh so architect
okay next we have
an inventor many things that we use in
our life
right they were made for the first time
by someone a long time ago or
may nowadays just a few years ago
these people are inventors they
make new machines they make
new tools so an inventor is
someone who makes something new a person
who makes something new
and we have a picture of a famous
inventor
thomas edison he's famous for
many inventions probably the most famous
invention is the light bulb right
we have electric light bulbs thanks to
thomas
edison okay
let's move on to living in a
neighborhood
what are the places in your neighborhood
so you think about your neighborhood the
area
around your house what are some
different places that you can think of
in the area around your house
well first of all you probably think of
school right
because we go there every day or we used
to go there every day hopefully we are
still going there every
day a school a school is where you go
to learn right next we have
a zoo we talked about zoo in the
vocabulary section
you can go there to see many different
kinds of
animals also we talked about
a child care center a child
care center or daycare center
where you go somebody takes
care of you when your parents are busy
during the day next
we didn't talk about this place i hope
you don't have to go there
it's called the police station the
police station
is where police officers
gather before their work many police
officers
work in the police station some police
officers go there to change into their
uniform
to get their police car and drive around
it's where the police are who can help
you
in case of an emergency so the police
are there to protect you
and this is their office building the
police station
next we have the library
you go there often don't you okay
the library is when you is where you can
find
many books and also videos
you can find a lot of knowledge a lot of
information in a library and usually
kids can go there adults go there to
study
to pick up new books and to read
to improve your minds
last we have park and we talked about
park before
a park is a big open outdoor
space where you can walk you can rest
you can ride a bike you can do many
things
it's a public place anybody can go there
okay so these are different places in
our neighborhood
okay we talked about different places in
the neighborhood
now let's talk about some people in the
neighborhood
who can help you or who can
do things for you there are many people
in your neighborhood that make your
neighborhood a good
place to live let's look at four
different types of
helpers first we have
a zookeeper we talked about zoos before
right
zoos are places you can go and see many
animals but
who takes care of the animals who
feeds the animals who makes sure
that the animals are healthy and doing
well
that person is a zoo keeper
a zookeeper takes care of
the animals they feed the animals
they give medicine to the animals
they make sure the animals are healthy
and happy i hope okay good that's a
zookeeper
next we have volunteer
volunteer maybe a little difficult word
what is a volunteer a volunteer
is someone who helps other people
not for their job not for money
just because they are a good person
right
they want to help other people so
you might volunteer to help
older people in a nursing home for
example
you can go and read stories to the older
people
you can help them with their meals
you can help clean up trash pick up
trash
in your neighborhood that's being a
volunteer
and it helps everybody in your
neighborhood
so if you like to help people maybe you
can be
a volunteer it's a good thing to do
next we have teacher
now you know what a teacher is in your
school
there are many teachers and you have
different teachers
for different subjects you have an
english teacher
you have a math teacher you have a
science teacher
you have many different kinds of
teachers
they teach other people
okay finally we have police officer
remember we talked about police station
places in the neighborhood well at the
police station
of course you can find police officers
but you can also find police officers
on the streets in your neighborhood
because police officers
walk around your neighborhood they drive
around your neighborhood to make sure
everyone
is safe and if you need help
you can always go to a police officer
and say
excuse me mr police officer or
ms police officer can you help me
and they will help you so those are
different types of helpers
in your neighborhood
now let's read the reading passage about
living in a neighborhood so all the
vocabulary we learned
and all the ideas that we looked at
we'll find many of those in the reading
passage
so let's read together read with me
if you want in your mind or out loud
read out loud with me to practice
understanding the words and saying the
words too
you guys ready let's begin
in our neighborhood we can see
many different kinds of places
and people there is a park
near my home my family
and i go for picnics there
in the summer the park
is a good place for everybody
next to the park there is
a zoo the zoo
is home to different kinds of
amazing animals
among those animals i
really enjoy watching monkeys
and elephants
close to my home there is also
a child care center
we take our baby sister there
every morning before school
scientists architects
and artists work
hard to improve our neighborhood
making wide avenues and
beautiful buildings
good
inventors also create
important things our neighborhood
is a clean and safe place
to live in many different
kinds of people work
together to make our
neighborhood better and
you can too okay
very good story you can too you can be a
volunteer
okay
now it's time for the reading skill and
this is to
classify classify means to
put uh words or objects
into certain categories or
groups right here we have
two groups one group is
places and one group is
people right so places and people
two groups we need to put the words
into the right group okay and we have
three blanks so from
our vocabulary think about the
vocabulary that we
studied what words would we put in each
blank
one word a is a place
b and c are people
okay so let's take a look
places we see a park
a zoo and a child care
center we take our baby sister
to the peep every morning
so every morning they take the baby
sister
to this place do they take her to the
park
every morning that's possible but they
probably
every morning they probably take their
baby sister
and they leave her at that place
during the day and then in the evening
they come
and get her or the afternoon they come
and get her back so you don't want to
leave a baby sister in the park
every morning no that's not good and
don't leave her in the zoo
that's dangerous that could be dangerous
right but
if you leave her at the child care
center ah then at the child care center
there are people who will take care of
her
during the day so that's our answer
we take our baby sister to the child
care center every morning okay
good okay so child care center is a
place
good next we have people and there are
two blanks so we need to
find words that describe two different
uh people okay so remember
the vocabulary that we talked about
so there are people like scientists
and artists oh by the way pronunciation
scientists scientists
artists right so don't make an
extra syllable for the s at the end
it's not scientists no it's just
scientists
scientists okay scientists
artists okay there are people
like scientists peep
and artists they work
to make this place peep
okay so what can we put in the blanks
well we learned a lot about different
types of people
scientists uh you could
put um different words there
but what i think they're looking for is
someone who makes the place
better yeah you could put architects
that's true
but what about inventors inventors make
new things they really do make your
whole life better
architects just make buildings yeah that
makes your life better but inventors
make
all sorts of things so there are people
like
scientists inventors and
artists they work to make
this place this place or neighborhood
what they want to improve it they want
to make it
better so remember improve is to make
something better
we can't use improve here we can you
can't say they work to make this place
improve
that doesn't make sense because improve
is a verb
it should be an adjective better so they
work to make this
place better right they work
to improve this place is another
way you could say that okay so we have
places
and we have people places park zoo child
care center
people scientists inventors
artists architects right and those
people what do they do
they make our neighborhoods better okay
very good job everybody i hope you
learned a lot
in that lesson we'll see you next time
take care
bye bye

person this type of person is
06:17
a scientist a scientist
06:20

06:30
experiments
06:31
with dangerous chemicals right just a

scientist is
06:36
someone who is looking for more
06:39
knowledge

science but really it's a person who
06:53
studies
06:54
nature and things that happen

architect is a person who designs
07:31
buildings
07:32
they don't make the buildings they
07:34
design the building
07:36
so if you like to draw and you like big
07:39
buildings
07:40
maybe you can become an architect
07:44
you can draw and plan buildings
07:47
and then many people will build
07:50
a building based on your design
07:54

just because they are a good person
13:04

13:05
they want to help other people so
13:08

13:12
older people in a nursing home for

15:28

15:31
words too
15:32

15:36
in our neighborhood we can see
15:39
many different kinds of places
15:43
and people there is a park
15:47
near my home my family
15:51
and i go for picnics there
15:55
in the summer the park
15:58
is a good place for everybody
16:04
next to the park there is
16:07
a zoo the zoo
16:10
is home to different kinds of
16:14
amazing animals
16:18
among those animals i
16:22
really enjoy watching monkeys
16:26
and elephants
16:30
close to my home there is also
16:33
a child care center
16:37
we take our baby sister there
16:40
every morning before school
16:45
scientists architects
16:50
and artists work
16:53
hard to improve our neighborhood
16:57
making wide avenues and
17:00
beautiful buildings
17:04
good
17:08
inventors also create
17:11
important things our neighborhood
17:15
is a clean and safe place
17:19
to live in many different
17:22
kinds of people work
17:25
together to make our
17:29
neighborhood better and
17:32
you can too okay
17:35
very good story you can too you can be a
17:38
volunteer
17:40
okay
17:44
now it's time for the reading skill and
17:47
this is to
17:48
classify classify means to
17:52
put uh words or objects
17:55
into certain categories or
17:59
groups right here we have
18:02
two groups one group is
18:05
places and one group is
18:09
people right so places and people
18:12
two groups we need to put the words
18:15
into the right group okay and we have
18:19
three blanks so from
18:22
our vocabulary think about the
18:25
vocabulary that we
18:26
studied what words would we put in each
18:30
blank
18:30
one word a is a place
18:34
b and c are people
18:38
okay so let's take a look
18:41
places we see a park
18:46
a zoo and a child care
18:49
center we take our baby sister
18:54
to the peep every morning
18:58
so every morning they take the baby
19:01
sister
19:02
to this place do they take her to the
19:05
park
19:06
every morning that's possible but they
19:09
probably
19:09
every morning they probably take their
19:11
baby sister
19:12
and they leave her at that place
19:15
during the day and then in the evening
19:18
they come
19:19
and get her or the afternoon they come
19:21
and get her back so you don't want to
19:23
leave a baby sister in the park
19:25
every morning no that's not good and
19:28
don't leave her in the zoo
19:29
that's dangerous that could be dangerous
19:32
right but
19:33
if you leave her at the child care
19:37
center ah then at the child care center
19:40
there are people who will take care of
19:43
her
19:44
during the day so that's our answer
19:47
we take our baby sister to the child
19:50
care center every morning okay
19:54
good okay so child care center is a
19:57
place
19:58
good next we have people and there are
20:02
two blanks so we need to
20:04
find words that describe two different
20:07
uh people okay so remember
20:10
the vocabulary that we talked about
20:15
so there are people like scientists
20:19
and artists oh by the way pronunciation
20:24
scientists scientists
20:27
artists right so don't make an
20:31
extra syllable for the s at the end
20:34
it's not scientists no it's just
20:37
scientists
20:39
scientists okay scientists
20:43
artists okay there are people
20:46
like scientists peep
20:50
and artists they work
20:53
to make this place peep
20:56
okay so what can we put in the blanks
21:00
well we learned a lot about different
21:02
types of people
21:03
scientists uh you could
21:06
put um different words there
21:09
but what i think they're looking for is
21:11
someone who makes the place
21:12
better yeah you could put architects
21:15
that's true
21:16
but what about inventors inventors make
21:20
new things they really do make your
21:22
whole life better
21:23
architects just make buildings yeah that
21:26
makes your life better but inventors
21:28
make
21:28
all sorts of things so there are people
21:31
like
21:32
scientists inventors and
21:35
artists they work to make
21:38
this place this place or neighborhood
21:41
what they want to improve it they want
21:44
to make it
21:45
better so remember improve is to make
21:47
something better
21:48
we can't use improve here we can you
21:51
can't say they work to make this place
21:52
improve
21:53
that doesn't make sense because improve
21:55
is a verb
21:56
it should be an adjective better so they
21:59
work to make this
22:00
place better right they work
22:04
to improve this place is another
22:07
way you could say that okay so we have
22:09
places
22:10
and we have people places park zoo child
22:13
care center
22:14
people scientists inventors
22:17
artists architects right and those
22:21
people what do they do
22:22
they make our neighborhoods better okay
22:26
very good job everybody i hope you
22:29
learned a lot
22:29
in that lesson we'll see you next time
22:32
take care
22:33
bye bye
