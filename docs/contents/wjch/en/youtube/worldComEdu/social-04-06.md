hello everybody how are you today
my name is brian stewart and today we're
going over
social studies book for lesson 6
american heritage in this unit
you will discover different ways
americans remember
their nation's history and some famous
american symbols so let's get started
as always we start with the vocabulary
section
and our first word is an interesting
word it's
heritage what is heritage this is a
little bit of a difficult word isn't it
heritage means the important traditions
and
values that are handed down from
one generation to the next so heritage
is something that you get from your
parents and their parents
and their parents before them it's
traditions and values
customs and traditional beliefs
that are handed down from generation
to generation that is heritage
next we have memorial every nation
has statues around their country
to remind the people of important events
in the past and also famous people who
helped
make or shape the nation that the statue
is in
so a memorial is a statue or some stone
that is built in memory of someone
or something important so again a
memorial can be a statue
to a famous person or it can just be
maybe a stone a carved stone
that remembers an event that happened in
the past like for example
a famous battle or some other
event that was very important to the
nation's history
of course the next word is remind and
that's what memorials do
they remind us of things that happened
in the past
people and events that happened in the
past
so remind means to make someone remember
something or someone else and of course
in this lesson we're talking about
important
events or important people in the past
we should
remember them so there are statues or
monuments
to remind us of those people or
events
arch now this is a famous arch in
america we'll talk about it later
but an arch is basically a structure
that has a curved
top just like this of course there's a
very
famous restaurant that's almost in every
country in the world
that is very famous for its double
arches
do you know what restaurant i mean i'm
sure you probably do
okay but this is just a single arch and
we'll talk about this
later on banner now there are many types
of banners
a long time ago when people fought wars
especially in
in medieval europe and of course in
other parts of the world too
different armies or different groups in
the battle would have these
poles with a flag on it and it's type
it's a type of banner and it had this
symbol of their group of their clan
or of their family and you could see the
banner
and know where your group or where your
enemy was
so of course there are many types of
banners a flag is a type of banner but a
flag represents
a country so every nation in the world
of course has a flag
and these are types of banners not
every banner is a national flag but flag
country flags are types of
banners okay
next we have national anthem
what is the national anthem of your
country do you know it
it's a song that is very patriotic
it it's a song that reminds us of our
country
and of the values of our country and
it's usually the
official song of a country now countries
have official songs
those are called national anthems sports
teams
might have their own song and those
would be of course just sports songs or
team songs
but countries will have an official song
and it's called the national
anthem next we have
star spangled now star spangled really
refers to the american flag
because star spangled means it's covered
or decorated with stars
and as you can see in this picture the
red circle
is around the stars on the flag
now star spangled what do those stars
represent
there are many many stars on the
american flag
why are there so many because each star
represents one state in
the united states and if you know about
america
uh you may know that there are 50 states
in america
so there are 50 stars on the flag
a lot of stars so when you cover or
decorate something with a lot
of stars we say star spangled
and that's part of the national anthem
of the us they talk about the
star-spangled banner
they're referring to the united states
or the american flag
fort of course a fort is a very old type
of building
it goes back thousands of years when
civilizations
first started becoming a feature of
human life
people built forts to protect their
civilization
but a fort is usually a smaller building
it's not a city
or a village it's a smaller area
where only soldiers they work or they
may
live there a long time ago they might
live there but nowadays they just work
there
and it's a walled building of course
forts aren't very important anymore
in modern times but they are still
places for soldiers to work and to train
and to do their jobs okay so
that's our vocabulary for this lesson
okay one of the main ideas of this unit
is that we can see the history of the
united
states through various things one thing
that we can see the history of the
united states is
is through heritage and remember
heritage is the customs and beliefs
and the traditions that are handed down
from generation
to generation in america americans
celebrate many different holidays
in a previous lesson we talked about
veterans day
and memorial day well these holidays and
these events
are part of the american heritage
so heritage is a very important way to
celebrate your nation's
history another way that people
celebrate their nation's history or to
show to remind themselves
of their history is to make memorials
and there's a very famous memorial
in washington dc and it is the lincoln
memorial the lincoln memorial reminds us
of course of abraham lincoln it's a
statue of him
it's in his likeness and i was lucky
enough to go and visit it in person
it's very impressive if you ever do
visit washington dc
i strongly recommend going to see the
lincoln memorial
this the memorial is huge it's really
big i mean
you feel very small when you look up at
the memorial
and behind uh abraham lincoln you can't
really see it in the picture
and on the sides of the walls are the
words from his
famous speeches so
it's a very impressive place and if you
turn around and you look over the
washington mall
you can see the or the national mall you
can see the washington monument
right there and on the other side is the
capitol building that's the us
congress so it's a very famous spot in
washington dc
next we have a song now every country
has their own
official song and we call that the
national anthem
the star-spangled banner now you know
what that means of course
because of the vocabulary star spangled
covered with stars
banner is a flag so the star-spangled
banner
is the idea of the um
of the american flag it is the national
anthem
of the us and in fact this
song is about a very famous battle that
took place
at i think at the beginning of the
revolutionary war
uh when america was winning its
independence from britain
and of course the words were inspired uh
by the uh by the flag
of the of america the star-spangled
banner banner
shall ever wave and that that's a very
famous song that all americans sing
usually in front of before sports games
and of course politic
large political events there will be
somebody who sings the song
before these events so it's a very
famous song in america the star-spangled
banner
so think about what is your country's
anthem okay
now we have different symbols of the u.s
of course the lincoln memorial
is one symbol but there are many other
famous
symbols of the united states uh first
one is the liberty bell the liberty bell
is a very famous uh uh
icon or uh symbol of the united states
it's also famous for its crack
in the bell that's a very famous part of
the bell
statue of liberty of course stands in
new york harbor
stat the statue of liberty was actually
a gift by the
government of france to because
uh france also had a revolution for
independence
to promote democracy in their country
and so
after their revolution after democracy
was established in france
they sent a statue of liberty to america
and america put a big monument in new
york and the statue of liberty has
greeted
immigrants from mostly europe for
many years it's the first thing if you
were in europe
a hundred years ago 150 years ago and
you wanted to come to america like many
immigrants
many boats went to new york and the
first thing that those immigrants
saw when they came to america was the
statue of liberty in the harbor
holding up the torch of freedom so it's
a very symbolic
icon of america next as i said before
the washington monument
you can see the washington monument from
the lincoln memorial
right if you turn around so the lincoln
memorial is behind you
you're looking straight at the
washington monument and you can see it's
a very tall
pillar and it's it's actually honoring
george washington
who was the first president of the
united states and that's right in the
middle
of the uh washington mall here
that's interesting okay okay so that's
the washington monument
and then of course many countries have a
symbolic
animal just like many countries have a
symbolic song
they might have a symbolic flower they
might have a symbolic
animal in america it's the bald eagle
the bald eagle is supposed to represent
power and
strength and independence as well did
you know that benjamin franklin
didn't like the bald eagle he actually
wanted the turkey
to be the uh national bird of america
but um that would be interesting but
anyway
uh the vote was that the bald eagle
became
the national bird and it's the symbol on
many government
of uh buildings and also if you look at
the president when the president gives a
speech
there's a symbol uh in on the podium
where he gives a speech
and it's of the eagle and the eagle is
also on many
coins american coins you can also see
the eagle on
many different american coins so it is
the also a symbol
of america okay now it's time for the
reading
so as usual i will read out loud
practice along in your mind or practice
out loud
practice the pronunciation and focus on
the vocabulary
words that we have learned are you ready
i'm ready let's begin okay
the history of the united states can be
seen
in the heritage passed down from person
to person it can also be
seen in the famous memorials and songs
the americans have made
there are many famous memorials in the
united states
perhaps one of the most famous is the
lincoln memorial
this reminds us of abraham lincoln
who was the president during the civil
war
the gateway arch in missouri
is another memorial this one
is dedicated to the first pioneers
who moved out west
so this is the famous arch i told you
about the arch of course is in
saint louis missouri st louis is a
very famous city in missouri and
missouri is kind of considered
the gateway to the west many people who
were
on the east coast of america who went
and settled the west
they probably passed through st louis
and the arch is like a gateway
the arch wasn't there of course it was
built much later
to remember those brave people who
went across the nation to settle in the
west
okay the most famous
song for americans is the star-spangled
banner
this song was written about the defense
of a fort
by american soldiers and became the
national
anthem of the united states
the banner of the united states has a
similar name and
it is called the stars and stripes
so again we talked about the
star-spangled banner
we said there are many stars on the flag
but there's
also many stripes and those red and
white stripes
represent the original 13 colonies
of the united states so you have the 13
original colonies
and 50 states and that's the
star-spangled banner
the stars and stripes okay let's talk
about the reading skill
and how was the information in the
reading passage organized
so here we have main idea and details
what is the main idea here the main idea
is
the us history can be seen in the beep
memorials and songs
and actually we have one two three four
five
five blanks in this chart here so we
have the main idea we'll fill in the
blank in a second
but then we have three supporting ideas
that support the main idea
so first of all let's talk about the
main idea there's a blank in here so
to think about or to remind us of a
nation's history
right we can have national songs we can
have memorials
what was the other thing that we talked
about that reminds us
of our nation's history and of course
this is passed down from generation to
generation
of course it is heritage
heritage
okay good so heritage is the customs and
beliefs
traditions that are handed down from
generation to generation
that's the main idea so the details
should be supporting this sentence we
can see examples maybe of each
in the details down below now we have
b is a blank d is a blank and then over
here
we have aha so we need something that's
similar to star
spangled banner star-spangled banner of
course is a song
so it's a song that's part of the
american heritage
it reminds us of the u.s history so
we're looking for
similar ideas for b and d well
we don't have much on b just a blank so
let's look
at the details below b and that is this
beep
of abraham lincoln aha so we're talking
about either a memorial
you know the song goes with
star-spangled banner so we're looking at
a memorial or some type of heritage
well of course in the uh reading passage
we talked about what
we talked about the lincoln memorial
it is about abraham lincoln so
we would put that here lincoln
memorial
[Music]
because that supports the idea
of memorials right just as songs
star-spangled banner supports the idea
of songs
so that's what we would put there and
the lincoln memorial what does it do
it beep us of abraham lincoln of course
when we see the statue
what do we think about what are we
reminded of
it reminds us of abraham lincoln so this
reminds
us of abraham lincoln
okay good next we have just a blank so
we need to look at the details here
to figure out what do we put in this
blank well the detail
is this is dedicated
to the first pioneers who moved out west
and remember it was also part of our
vocabulary right not the whole word but
the last part of the word was part of
our vocabulary and the last part of our
word was
arch so which arch did we talk about in
the reading passage
we talked about the gateway arch
the gate way arch because
the gateway arch in saint louis missouri
reminds us of the pioneers who went
out west actually the arch it also
reminds me of
many pioneers when they went out west
they had a
covered a wagon right
and uh you know i'm not a very good
artist so please bear with me
um a wheel here maybe they had a wheel
here and then they had the horses i'm
not even gonna draw the horses
but this is like a covered wagon and the
arches remind me
of the arches on the covered wagon of
course this is covered with
tent or some kind of fabric and so many
pioneers that's kind of symbolic
of the pioneers who moved out west they
had a long wagon train
and it's interesting that these arches
are very similar to the gateway arch
in st louis okay next we have the
star-spangled banner that's a song
right this is the beep of the united
states
so remember i talked about many
countries might have a particular song
and that song is called the national
anthem the national
anthem i don't have enough room i go
anthem that's okay
national anthem and that is the official
song
of a country so the star-spangled banner
refers to the american flag because
it has a lot of stars on it it is the
national anthem
of the united states okay great
well that wraps up our lesson about the
american heritage
and it's interesting of course to think
about the heritage of your country
just going to fix that wheel there it's
too small i don't know if that's a good
fix
but anyway every country has their own
heritage
and think about your own country's
heritage what are the
famous memorials songs or
customs maybe you have certain holidays
throughout the year
to remind yourself of your country's
heritage how do you celebrate your
country and you should know your own
national anthem
if you don't know ask your mom or dad or
look it up
because it's important to know your
country's anthem
okay well that's our lesson for today
thanks for studying with me
take care everybody see you in the next
one
you

hello everybody how are you today
00:10
my name is brian stewart and today we're
00:12
going over
00:13
social studies book for lesson 6
00:17
american heritage in this unit
00:20
you will discover different ways
00:23
americans remember
00:24
their nation's history and some famous
00:28
american symbols so let's get started
00:34
as always we start with the vocabulary
00:37
section
00:38
and our first word is an interesting
00:40
word it's
00:41
heritage what is heritage this is a
00:45
little bit of a difficult word isn't it
00:47
heritage means the important traditions
00:50
and
00:51
values that are handed down from
00:54
one generation to the next so heritage
00:58
is something that you get from your
00:59
parents and their parents
01:02
and their parents before them it's
01:04
traditions and values
01:06
customs and traditional beliefs
01:09
that are handed down from generation
01:13
to generation that is heritage
01:19
next we have memorial every nation
01:23
has statues around their country
01:26
to remind the people of important events
01:30
in the past and also famous people who
01:33
helped
01:34
make or shape the nation that the statue
01:38
is in
01:39
so a memorial is a statue or some stone
01:42
that is built in memory of someone
01:46
or something important so again a
01:49
memorial can be a statue
01:51
to a famous person or it can just be
01:55
maybe a stone a carved stone
01:58
that remembers an event that happened in
02:01
the past like for example
02:02
a famous battle or some other
02:06
event that was very important to the
02:08
nation's history
02:13
of course the next word is remind and
02:15
that's what memorials do
02:17
they remind us of things that happened
02:20
in the past
02:21
people and events that happened in the
02:24
past
02:24
so remind means to make someone remember
02:28
something or someone else and of course
02:32
in this lesson we're talking about
02:34
important
02:35
events or important people in the past
02:38
we should
02:38
remember them so there are statues or
02:42
monuments
02:42
to remind us of those people or
02:46
events
02:49
arch now this is a famous arch in
02:52
america we'll talk about it later
02:54
but an arch is basically a structure
02:56
that has a curved
02:57
top just like this of course there's a
03:00
very
03:00
famous restaurant that's almost in every
03:04
country in the world
03:05
that is very famous for its double
03:08
arches
03:09
do you know what restaurant i mean i'm
03:11
sure you probably do
03:13
okay but this is just a single arch and
03:16
we'll talk about this
03:17
later on banner now there are many types
03:21
of banners
03:22
a long time ago when people fought wars
03:25
especially in
03:26
in medieval europe and of course in
03:28
other parts of the world too
03:29
different armies or different groups in
03:31
the battle would have these
03:33
poles with a flag on it and it's type
03:36
it's a type of banner and it had this
03:38
symbol of their group of their clan
03:41
or of their family and you could see the
03:44
banner
03:44
and know where your group or where your
03:47
enemy was
03:48
so of course there are many types of
03:49
banners a flag is a type of banner but a
03:52
flag represents
03:54
a country so every nation in the world
03:57
of course has a flag
03:59
and these are types of banners not
04:02
every banner is a national flag but flag
04:05
country flags are types of
04:07
banners okay
04:11
next we have national anthem
04:14
what is the national anthem of your
04:16
country do you know it
04:18
it's a song that is very patriotic
04:21
it it's a song that reminds us of our
04:24
country
04:25
and of the values of our country and
04:28
it's usually the
04:29
official song of a country now countries
04:32
have official songs
04:34
those are called national anthems sports
04:36
teams
04:37
might have their own song and those
04:39
would be of course just sports songs or
04:42
team songs
04:43
but countries will have an official song
04:46
and it's called the national
04:48
anthem next we have
04:51
star spangled now star spangled really
04:54
refers to the american flag
04:57
because star spangled means it's covered
04:59
or decorated with stars
05:01
and as you can see in this picture the
05:04
red circle
05:05
is around the stars on the flag
05:08
now star spangled what do those stars
05:11
represent
05:12
there are many many stars on the
05:14
american flag
05:16
why are there so many because each star
05:19
represents one state in
05:22
the united states and if you know about
05:25
america
05:26
uh you may know that there are 50 states
05:29
in america
05:30
so there are 50 stars on the flag
05:33
a lot of stars so when you cover or
05:36
decorate something with a lot
05:38
of stars we say star spangled
05:42
and that's part of the national anthem
05:44
of the us they talk about the
05:46
star-spangled banner
05:47
they're referring to the united states
05:49
or the american flag
05:52
fort of course a fort is a very old type
05:55
of building
05:56
it goes back thousands of years when
05:59
civilizations
06:00
first started becoming a feature of
06:04
human life
06:05
people built forts to protect their
06:07
civilization
06:09
but a fort is usually a smaller building
06:11
it's not a city
06:12
or a village it's a smaller area
06:16
where only soldiers they work or they
06:19
may
06:20
live there a long time ago they might
06:21
live there but nowadays they just work
06:23
there
06:24
and it's a walled building of course
06:26
forts aren't very important anymore
06:28
in modern times but they are still
06:31
places for soldiers to work and to train
06:35
and to do their jobs okay so
06:39
that's our vocabulary for this lesson
06:43
okay one of the main ideas of this unit
06:45
is that we can see the history of the
06:47
united
06:48
states through various things one thing
06:51
that we can see the history of the
06:52
united states is
06:54
is through heritage and remember
06:56
heritage is the customs and beliefs
06:59
and the traditions that are handed down
07:01
from generation
07:02
to generation in america americans
07:05
celebrate many different holidays
07:07
in a previous lesson we talked about
07:09
veterans day
07:10
and memorial day well these holidays and
07:14
these events
07:15
are part of the american heritage
07:19
so heritage is a very important way to
07:21
celebrate your nation's
07:23
history another way that people
07:26
celebrate their nation's history or to
07:28
show to remind themselves
07:30
of their history is to make memorials
07:33
and there's a very famous memorial
07:35
in washington dc and it is the lincoln
07:39
memorial the lincoln memorial reminds us
07:42
of course of abraham lincoln it's a
07:44
statue of him
07:45
it's in his likeness and i was lucky
07:48
enough to go and visit it in person
07:50
it's very impressive if you ever do
07:52
visit washington dc
07:54
i strongly recommend going to see the
07:57
lincoln memorial
07:58
this the memorial is huge it's really
08:00
big i mean
08:01
you feel very small when you look up at
08:04
the memorial
08:04
and behind uh abraham lincoln you can't
08:07
really see it in the picture
08:08
and on the sides of the walls are the
08:11
words from his
08:12
famous speeches so
08:15
it's a very impressive place and if you
08:17
turn around and you look over the
08:19
washington mall
08:20
you can see the or the national mall you
08:22
can see the washington monument
08:24
right there and on the other side is the
08:26
capitol building that's the us
08:28
congress so it's a very famous spot in
08:30
washington dc
08:33
next we have a song now every country
08:36
has their own
08:37
official song and we call that the
08:39
national anthem
08:41
the star-spangled banner now you know
08:43
what that means of course
08:45
because of the vocabulary star spangled
08:47
covered with stars
08:48
banner is a flag so the star-spangled
08:51
banner
08:52
is the idea of the um
08:55
of the american flag it is the national
08:58
anthem
08:59
of the us and in fact this
09:02
song is about a very famous battle that
09:04
took place
09:05
at i think at the beginning of the
09:07
revolutionary war
09:08
uh when america was winning its
09:10
independence from britain
09:12
and of course the words were inspired uh
09:15
by the uh by the flag
09:18
of the of america the star-spangled
09:20
banner banner
09:22
shall ever wave and that that's a very
09:24
famous song that all americans sing
09:27
usually in front of before sports games
09:30
and of course politic
09:31
large political events there will be
09:34
somebody who sings the song
09:37
before these events so it's a very
09:39
famous song in america the star-spangled
09:41
banner
09:41
so think about what is your country's
09:43
anthem okay
09:46
now we have different symbols of the u.s
09:48
of course the lincoln memorial
09:50
is one symbol but there are many other
09:52
famous
09:53
symbols of the united states uh first
09:56
one is the liberty bell the liberty bell
09:59
is a very famous uh uh
10:02
icon or uh symbol of the united states
10:05
it's also famous for its crack
10:09
in the bell that's a very famous part of
10:12
the bell
10:13
statue of liberty of course stands in
10:15
new york harbor
10:16
stat the statue of liberty was actually
10:18
a gift by the
10:20
government of france to because
10:23
uh france also had a revolution for
10:26
independence
10:27
to promote democracy in their country
10:29
and so
10:30
after their revolution after democracy
10:32
was established in france
10:34
they sent a statue of liberty to america
10:37
and america put a big monument in new
10:39
york and the statue of liberty has
10:42
greeted
10:42
immigrants from mostly europe for
10:45
many years it's the first thing if you
10:48
were in europe
10:49
a hundred years ago 150 years ago and
10:52
you wanted to come to america like many
10:54
immigrants
10:55
many boats went to new york and the
10:58
first thing that those immigrants
11:00
saw when they came to america was the
11:02
statue of liberty in the harbor
11:04
holding up the torch of freedom so it's
11:07
a very symbolic
11:10
icon of america next as i said before
11:13
the washington monument
11:15
you can see the washington monument from
11:17
the lincoln memorial
11:19
right if you turn around so the lincoln
11:21
memorial is behind you
11:22
you're looking straight at the
11:23
washington monument and you can see it's
11:26
a very tall
11:27
pillar and it's it's actually honoring
11:31
george washington
11:32
who was the first president of the
11:34
united states and that's right in the
11:36
middle
11:36
of the uh washington mall here
11:39
that's interesting okay okay so that's
11:42
the washington monument
11:44
and then of course many countries have a
11:46
symbolic
11:47
animal just like many countries have a
11:50
symbolic song
11:51
they might have a symbolic flower they
11:54
might have a symbolic
11:55
animal in america it's the bald eagle
11:58
the bald eagle is supposed to represent
12:01
power and
12:02
strength and independence as well did
12:05
you know that benjamin franklin
12:07
didn't like the bald eagle he actually
12:09
wanted the turkey
12:10
to be the uh national bird of america
12:14
but um that would be interesting but
12:16
anyway
12:17
uh the vote was that the bald eagle
12:19
became
12:20
the national bird and it's the symbol on
12:23
many government
12:24
of uh buildings and also if you look at
12:26
the president when the president gives a
12:28
speech
12:29
there's a symbol uh in on the podium
12:32
where he gives a speech
12:33
and it's of the eagle and the eagle is
12:35
also on many
12:36
coins american coins you can also see
12:39
the eagle on
12:40
many different american coins so it is
12:42
the also a symbol
12:44
of america okay now it's time for the
12:47
reading
12:47
so as usual i will read out loud
12:49
practice along in your mind or practice
12:52
out loud
12:53
practice the pronunciation and focus on
12:55
the vocabulary
12:57
words that we have learned are you ready
13:00
i'm ready let's begin okay
13:04
the history of the united states can be
13:07
seen
13:08
in the heritage passed down from person
13:12
to person it can also be
13:15
seen in the famous memorials and songs
13:19
the americans have made
13:25
there are many famous memorials in the
13:28
united states
13:29
perhaps one of the most famous is the
13:33
lincoln memorial
13:35
this reminds us of abraham lincoln
13:39
who was the president during the civil
13:42
war
13:45
the gateway arch in missouri
13:49
is another memorial this one
13:52
is dedicated to the first pioneers
13:56
who moved out west
13:59
so this is the famous arch i told you
14:01
about the arch of course is in
14:03
saint louis missouri st louis is a
14:07
very famous city in missouri and
14:09
missouri is kind of considered
14:11
the gateway to the west many people who
14:14
were
14:15
on the east coast of america who went
14:17
and settled the west
14:18
they probably passed through st louis
14:21
and the arch is like a gateway
14:24
the arch wasn't there of course it was
14:25
built much later
14:27
to remember those brave people who
14:30
went across the nation to settle in the
14:33
west
14:34
okay the most famous
14:37
song for americans is the star-spangled
14:41
banner
14:42
this song was written about the defense
14:44
of a fort
14:45
by american soldiers and became the
14:48
national
14:49
anthem of the united states
14:53
the banner of the united states has a
14:56
similar name and
14:58
it is called the stars and stripes
15:01
so again we talked about the
15:03
star-spangled banner
15:04
we said there are many stars on the flag
15:07
but there's
15:08
also many stripes and those red and
15:11
white stripes
15:12
represent the original 13 colonies
15:16
of the united states so you have the 13
15:18
original colonies
15:20
and 50 states and that's the
15:22
star-spangled banner
15:23
the stars and stripes okay let's talk
15:27
about the reading skill
15:28
and how was the information in the
15:30
reading passage organized
15:32
so here we have main idea and details
15:36
what is the main idea here the main idea
15:38
is
15:39
the us history can be seen in the beep
15:42
memorials and songs
15:46
and actually we have one two three four
15:48
five
15:49
five blanks in this chart here so we
15:52
have the main idea we'll fill in the
15:54
blank in a second
15:55
but then we have three supporting ideas
15:58
that support the main idea
16:01
so first of all let's talk about the
16:03
main idea there's a blank in here so
16:05
to think about or to remind us of a
16:08
nation's history
16:09
right we can have national songs we can
16:12
have memorials
16:13
what was the other thing that we talked
16:15
about that reminds us
16:17
of our nation's history and of course
16:20
this is passed down from generation to
16:22
generation
16:23
of course it is heritage
16:28
heritage
16:30
okay good so heritage is the customs and
16:33
beliefs
16:34
traditions that are handed down from
16:36
generation to generation
16:38
that's the main idea so the details
16:41
should be supporting this sentence we
16:43
can see examples maybe of each
16:46
in the details down below now we have
16:49
b is a blank d is a blank and then over
16:51
here
16:52
we have aha so we need something that's
16:54
similar to star
16:55
spangled banner star-spangled banner of
16:57
course is a song
17:00
so it's a song that's part of the
17:02
american heritage
17:04
it reminds us of the u.s history so
17:06
we're looking for
17:07
similar ideas for b and d well
17:10
we don't have much on b just a blank so
17:13
let's look
17:14
at the details below b and that is this
17:17
beep
17:18
of abraham lincoln aha so we're talking
17:21
about either a memorial
17:23
you know the song goes with
17:25
star-spangled banner so we're looking at
17:27
a memorial or some type of heritage
17:29
well of course in the uh reading passage
17:32
we talked about what
17:34
we talked about the lincoln memorial
17:37
it is about abraham lincoln so
17:40
we would put that here lincoln
17:44
memorial
17:45
[Music]
17:48
because that supports the idea
17:51
of memorials right just as songs
17:54
star-spangled banner supports the idea
17:56
of songs
17:57
so that's what we would put there and
17:59
the lincoln memorial what does it do
18:02
it beep us of abraham lincoln of course
18:05
when we see the statue
18:06
what do we think about what are we
18:08
reminded of
18:09
it reminds us of abraham lincoln so this
18:13
reminds
18:15
us of abraham lincoln
18:18
okay good next we have just a blank so
18:21
we need to look at the details here
18:24
to figure out what do we put in this
18:26
blank well the detail
18:27
is this is dedicated
18:30
to the first pioneers who moved out west
18:34
and remember it was also part of our
18:37
vocabulary right not the whole word but
18:39
the last part of the word was part of
18:41
our vocabulary and the last part of our
18:43
word was
18:44
arch so which arch did we talk about in
18:47
the reading passage
18:48
we talked about the gateway arch
18:51
the gate way arch because
18:55
the gateway arch in saint louis missouri
18:58
reminds us of the pioneers who went
19:02
out west actually the arch it also
19:04
reminds me of
19:05
many pioneers when they went out west
19:07
they had a
19:08
covered a wagon right
19:12
and uh you know i'm not a very good
19:15
artist so please bear with me
19:17
um a wheel here maybe they had a wheel
19:19
here and then they had the horses i'm
19:20
not even gonna draw the horses
19:21
but this is like a covered wagon and the
19:23
arches remind me
19:25
of the arches on the covered wagon of
19:28
course this is covered with
19:29
tent or some kind of fabric and so many
19:33
pioneers that's kind of symbolic
19:34
of the pioneers who moved out west they
19:37
had a long wagon train
19:38
and it's interesting that these arches
19:40
are very similar to the gateway arch
19:43
in st louis okay next we have the
19:46
star-spangled banner that's a song
19:48
right this is the beep of the united
19:51
states
19:51
so remember i talked about many
19:53
countries might have a particular song
19:56
and that song is called the national
19:59
anthem the national
20:05
anthem i don't have enough room i go
20:07
anthem that's okay
20:09
national anthem and that is the official
20:12
song
20:13
of a country so the star-spangled banner
20:15
refers to the american flag because
20:17
it has a lot of stars on it it is the
20:20
national anthem
20:21
of the united states okay great
20:24
well that wraps up our lesson about the
20:27
american heritage
20:29
and it's interesting of course to think
20:31
about the heritage of your country
20:33
just going to fix that wheel there it's
20:34
too small i don't know if that's a good
20:36
fix
20:36
but anyway every country has their own
20:39
heritage
20:40
and think about your own country's
20:41
heritage what are the
20:43
famous memorials songs or
20:46
customs maybe you have certain holidays
20:49
throughout the year
20:50
to remind yourself of your country's
20:53
heritage how do you celebrate your
20:55
country and you should know your own
20:57
national anthem
20:58
if you don't know ask your mom or dad or
21:01
look it up
21:02
because it's important to know your
21:03
country's anthem
21:05
okay well that's our lesson for today
21:06
thanks for studying with me
21:08
take care everybody see you in the next
21:14
one
21:16
you
