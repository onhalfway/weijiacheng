well of course we have to ask what is
mount rushmore right there's a little
clue by the way
mount means mountain
mountain mountain
and as we can see whoa there it is this
is a mountain
it's one big rock that's amazing
look at how big it is here are a couple
of people on motorcycles
here's a road and look at how big this
rock
is now can you see something special
about this mountain
sure there are some faces in the
mountain
how did they get there well we'll figure
that out
when we look at the reading here are
some more pictures
of mount rushmore this is a
coin that's used in america it's a coin
uh that shows famous people or places
many coins in america will do that
they're special coins
this coin here shows mount
rushmore look at the date 1889
this coin is very old but it celebrates
the making of mount rushmore and we can
see the four
faces here we'll talk about those four
faces in the reading
next we can see another type of example
of this
this is a stamp in america a stamp of
course
you lick it of course in korea you put
glue on it
and you put it on your envelope punji
right and then you can mail it well this
is a stamp
like this that we can see that like
these things the coin
and the stamp famous people famous
places famous events are
used as pictures on coins and stamps
and again we saw the coin now we see the
stamp
of mount rushmore and this is a special
stamp
that's made for a certain time so mount
rushmore is very
important in american history finally
we can see this picture shows the park
entrance there's a park in front of
mount rushmore
where many millions of people go there
every year
to look at mount rushmore when i was a
little boy
i went to this park i can still remember
standing there it was a nice sunny day i
think it was spring so it wasn't too hot
not too cold but it's a very beautiful
day and
my family and i we looked up at the
mount rushmore and we looked at the
shops in the park
okay so it's a very important place
in america let's learn some words that
we need to know
when we look at the reading passage
about mount rushmore
who made it what's it all about okay
well let's start with the words of
course
here we have having a high price
look at this car that car costs
a lot of money what can we say about the
car
we can say that it is expensive
it is expensive it takes
a lot of money you need a lot of money
to buy this car or to pay for this car
having a high price cars can be
expensive
buildings can be expensive construction
projects if you're building something
that can be expensive too
expensive means it needs a lot of money
number two whoa joshua mayo be careful
tnt of course uh these things what are
these things
uh of course you can have one alone or
you can tie many together
in movies about the old west you know
cowboys and indians
sometimes you see them being used in the
movie right people will light them
and throw them and they go boom right a
powerful bomb
is called dynamite dynamite
di na might three sounds
die na might put them all together
dynamite dynamite by the way
it's interesting dynamite means a bomb
but dynamite
is also used by young kids to say
something is
cool or wonderful hey man that's
dynamite means that's great cho is oil
that's dynamite because boom it's really
good
right so sometimes people will say
that's dynamite that's really good
but dynamite also means that it's a bomb
okay the the actual meaning number three
whoa be careful santa claus santa claus
is playing a fiddle
but look where he is he's in a very
what kind of position able to cause harm
he's in a very
dangerous position it's very dangerous
to be
sitting on the edge of a building don't
do that
that situation is very dangerous
so when you're talking about a situation
that can cause harm that can hurt
somebody that is a dangerous
situation or we can say that it
is dangerous okay next one
number four finish right
to come to the end of something all
these people are running
they look like they're in a marathon
they were in a race
they ran for a long time finally they
come to the
ending point the end of something of
course the word we're looking for
is the same as the word on the sign
finish
right finish finish when you finish
something
you come to the end of it whether it's
running
in a marathon or doing your homework you
finish
your homework or if you're in some long
project you finish you come to a finish
five wow that's really cool this guy's
at the beach
did you ever build something like this
right this
is of course we call this a sand castle
a sand castle
now can you build this sand castle
that's
very difficult this man is
really good at creating art
we can call him an artist
so he's an artist now artists make
many different things this man is making
a sand castle it looks like art it's
very beautiful
but of course artists also paint right
they can also make music we call these
people who create
things that we like and we enjoy that
are beautiful
we call them artists okay next one five
six sorry six where are your
eyes your nose and your mouth where are
they of course they're here
what do we call this part of our body
this part of our body here
we call it our face okay she's having
fun she's hiding
one of her eyes right so where your eyes
nose and mouth
are that's a person's face remember when
we looked at mount rushmore
we saw four faces so of course we need
to know
what a face is seven
wow that's really cool looking isn't it
this of course is a volcano
volcano volcano right a very high hill
a very high hill now it's interesting
because these are hills
right these down here are hills
they're not very high but if you look at
this that's not a hill
that's really really high we call it a
mountain
that's a mountain so the difference
between a hill
and a mountain hill versus mountain
hills are small as you can see they're
not that
tall but a mountain wow look at that
that's really steep and
really high that's a mountain
some people argue and they say that's a
mountain
another person saying that's not a
mountain that's a hill
right it depends also where people are
from
if somebody's from a place that's very
flat they might think wow that's a
mountain
but people who live in the mountains
saying that's not a mountain
that's a mountain over there okay very
high
okay next one eight now these two people
are doing something interesting what
happened looks like some
earthquake maybe came through an
earthquake shook
the earth and and what did it do it made
small
openings in something what do we call
this here
this of course is called a crack cr
cur cur the c is hard
cr put them together cur
cur crack okay
a c k crack now that's maybe difficult
to pronounce
crack crack so when you see a small
opening
especially in stone or
even metal a little opening looks like
it might
break soon you see cracks if you see
cracks
be careful because that means that
something might
break okay or something is not strong
it got weak somehow so if you see a
crack
be careful it's not strong anymore
number nine wow this is pretty cool do
you have one of these
this is a it's like a puzzle board right
there are many different
what the outline of something here we
have an
outline what is that and we have a
different outline
these of course are different shapes
okay this is a circle a triangle a
square
those are different shapes okay so the
outline of something
is its shape next one number 10
looks like junior is wearing daddy's
clothing
right he's got clothes that are too big
for him
he looks kind of cute but it looks kind
of strange his feet are so big
right for his face but of course those
are his dad's shoes
his feet are probably very small inside
that big shoe
big another word for big is
large large the boy's clothes
are too large for him
too large for him too big
for him okay so large large is something
that's very
big or you know huge huge is another
word you can use
huge has more emphasis
strength it's huge right
really really big not just big but huge
big and large and huge okay next one
11. wow that's a lot of money
my gosh that's a lot of money right here
we have
one zero zero zero zero zero zero
what is that what number do we call it
we call it
million remember in english we put zero
zero
zero then comma zero zero zero
then comma okay so three zeros comma
three zeros comma and then one we go
all right one ten hundred thousand
ten thousand one hundred thousand then
one
million okay so one million that's a
really big number
one million it i don't think there is a
i think this picture is not real i don't
think there's a real
1 million dollar bill that's crazy
can you imagine going to a store yeah
i'd like some milk
please here a million dollars do you
have change
that's crazy okay next one 12.
far above the ground far above the
ground
is high these balloons
that looks really cool by the way right
these balloons are
high in the air right they're far above
the ground they're very high
like that mountain we talked about
before right the mountain is really high
the hills are lower than the mountain so
something that's far above the ground is
high
13 not hard so
in other words it means that it's not
difficult right if somebody got
took a test they got an a plus that test
was not hard
it was easy it was very easy
that test was easy i hope your tests
are easy of course if you want your
tests to be
easy study hard then your tests
will be easier okay number fourteen
whoa what kind of car is that that's
really long
by the way just kunyang algoshibaio we
call that a limousine
you could call it a limo for short it's
a limo
it's a really long car it looks like
it's been
stretched right it's been stretched
stretch
it's great in distance or time great in
distance or times you're talking about
great
big or long in distance or time i just
told you long
it's long it's great in distance or
time to feel painful
oh no to feel painful poor guy looks
like he was playing soccer
and boom maybe somebody hit him on the
knee
it feels painful we say it hurts
so if you're playing sports and
something hits you
or you get a bruise by the way we could
call this a
bruise bruise
that's you know like a purple or blue
maybe red
because you hit something on your leg or
your arm and you have a strange color
that's a bruise a bruise hurts ow
right right
you say it hurts it hurts
do not say it's sick andeo
don't say it sick hajima don't say that
don't say my arm is sick that's crazy if
you say my arm is sick it's like i chew
at you oh poor arm drink some orange
juice right that's crazy
your arm can't be sick your whole body
is sick
sick is like kung gi right cough
or you're you have a cold right you're
sneezing
then you're sick but if your arm is
injured or your arm has a bruise
then you say my arm hurts
don't say my arm is sick that's konglish
my arm sorry my uh
my arm is sick is konglish
do not say that undale say my
arm hurts
that's correct okay my arm hurts yeah
sorry about that
is sick is wrong and you know it's it's
hard for me to write that right
because it's wrong but many students say
that it's
konglish don't say my arm is sick don't
say that
say my arm hurts i hope not but that's
what you say
okay to feel painful to hurt and
here we have hurt hurt hurt because hurt
here hurts is a verb right it hurts
it hurt yesterday it has hurt
for a long time so hurt hurt hurt
the verb doesn't change we don't use ed
don't say my
arm hurted yesterday no my arm
hurt yesterday my arm hurts now
it hurt yesterday and it has hurt
for a long time okay good
so that's hurt be careful with that word
as you can see
16 to stop living
this is very sad right to stop living
uh the person there's a body inside the
box right it used to be a person
that person died okay to die
means to stop living and that's very
unfortunate looks like a soldier lost
his or her life in a battle so to die
is to stop living okay well that wraps
up our
words let's uh use the words
to complete each sentence so we're going
to complete a sentence with the word
from the box we have many sentences
parts of the sentence are missing we
need to complete the sentence with these
words here
let's go over these words first we have
expensive expensive
expensive dynamite
dynamite next one
artist artist
that's easy face face
dangerous dangerous mountain
mountain finish
finish and crack
crack okay those are our words let's see
how they fit into
these sentences number one i dropped my
phone i hope you don't drop your phone
now it has a what and that's too bad
sometimes i see students
they're carrying their phone and the
glass on the front
has many what well of course many what
they have many cracks now it has a crack
do you see that sometimes your friends
or you're on the subway or the bus
you see somebody with their phone and it
looks like their phone they drop their

and there's a lot of cracks in the glass
that's too bad right oh that's terrible
if that happens
you drop your phone now it has a crack
or it has
many cracks usually it has many cracks
not just
one number two i climbed up a very big
what what would you climb up now of
course when you say climb
this means climb right if you walk up
you you hike up so you could also say
i hiked probably you guys hike
i don't think too many of you will climb
with ropes
and expensive gear right so i climbed up
a very big what what do you climb up
what do you
hike up you hike up a
mountain i hiked up a very big mountain
or i climbed up a very big mountain
okay we climb up we hike up mountains
i hike i don't really climb it's kind of
dangerous
and you need special equipment to climb
a mountain
three your eyes your eyes and your nose
are on your what on your elbow no
on your knee no they're on your
face of course we know that that's easy
your eyes and nose are on your face
okay number four it took
14 years it took 14 years
that means i needed 14 years
start finish 14 years
in between it took 14 years to beep
mount rushmore it took 14 years to do

finish something right
you can say it took certain amount of
time to finish

years

years to finish my homework what
that's crazy what kind of homework did
you have right
usually hopefully it took you one hour
to finish
your homework it took me uh
five minutes to finish washing the
dishes
right so it takes you a certain amount
of time
to finish to complete doing something
okay five don't run across the street
that's good advice don't run across the
street
why because there are cars right
if you do that you could get hurt
it's a situation that can cause harm
it is what it's dangerous
don't run across the street walk across
the street and be careful look
both ways and cross where you're
supposed to cross

in the middle right
okay number six beep makes
a loud noise if you light it what makes
a loud noise
if you use fire to light something
of course we're talking about dynamite
dynamite makes a loud noise
if you light it it doesn't just make a
loud noise
it also makes a really powerful
explosion
that's very dangerous right so it's not
just a loud noise
dynamite makes a loud explosion
explosion
nx sorry explosion it makes a loud
explosion boom lots of force very
dangerous
be careful of course you shouldn't be
around dynamite
you know you'll probably never
experience dynamite in your life

mount rushmore and we looked at the
03:10
shops in the park
03:12
okay so it's a very important place
03:15
in america let's learn some words that
03:18
we need to know
03:19
when we look at the reading passage
03:22
about mount rushmore
03:23
who made it what's it all about okay
03:26
well let's start with the words of
03:27
course
03:28
here we have having a high price
03:31
look at this car that car costs
03:34
a lot of money what can we say about the
03:37
car
03:38
we can say that it is expensive
03:42
it is expensive it takes
03:46
a lot of money you need a lot of money
03:49
to buy this car or to pay for this car
03:53
having a high price cars can be
03:56
expensive
03:57
buildings can be expensive construction
04:00
projects if you're building something
04:03
that can be expensive too
04:05
expensive means it needs a lot of money
04:09
number two whoa joshua mayo be careful
04:12
tnt of course uh these things what are
04:15
these things
04:16
uh of course you can have one alone or
04:19
you can tie many together
04:21
in movies about the old west you know
04:24
cowboys and indians
04:26
sometimes you see them being used in the
04:28
movie right people will light them
04:30
and throw them and they go boom right a
04:33
powerful bomb
04:34
is called dynamite dynamite
04:38
di na might three sounds
04:42
die na might put them all together
04:46
dynamite dynamite by the way
04:49
it's interesting dynamite means a bomb
04:52
but dynamite
04:53
is also used by young kids to say
04:56
something is
04:56
cool or wonderful hey man that's
05:00
dynamite means that's great cho is oil
05:05
that's dynamite because boom it's really
05:08
good
05:08
right so sometimes people will say
05:11
that's dynamite that's really good
05:13
but dynamite also means that it's a bomb
05:17
okay the the actual meaning number three
05:20
whoa be careful santa claus santa claus
05:23
is playing a fiddle
05:24
but look where he is he's in a very
05:29
what kind of position able to cause harm
05:31
he's in a very
05:33
dangerous position it's very dangerous
05:37
to be
05:38
sitting on the edge of a building don't
05:40
do that
05:41
that situation is very dangerous
05:44
so when you're talking about a situation
05:48
that can cause harm that can hurt
05:51
somebody that is a dangerous
05:54
situation or we can say that it
05:57

06:12
they ran for a long time finally they
06:14
come to the
06:15
ending point the end of something of
06:18
course the word we're looking for
06:20
is the same as the word on the sign
06:22
finish
06:23
right finish finish when you finish
06:26

06:26
you come to the end of it whether it's

06:42

06:48
right this
06:48
is of course we call this a sand castle
06:52
a sand castle
06:55
now can you build this sand castle
06:58
that's
06:59
very difficult this man is
07:02
really good at creating art
07:06
we can call him an artist
07:09
so he's an artist now artists make
07:13
many different things this man is making
07:16
a sand castle it looks like art it's
07:20
very beautiful
07:21
but of course artists also paint right
07:24
they can also make music we call these
07:27
people who create
07:29

07:56
nose and mouth
07:57
are that's a person's face remember when
08:00
we looked at mount rushmore
08:02
we saw four faces so of course we need
08:05
to know
08:06
what a face is seven
08:10
wow that's really cool looking isn't it
08:12
this of course is a volcano
08:16
volcano volcano right a very high hill
08:20
a very high hill now it's interesting
08:22
because these are hills
08:24
right these down here are hills
08:27
they're not very high but if you look at
08:30
this that's not a hill
08:31
that's really really high we call it a
08:34
mountain
08:35
that's a mountain so the difference
08:37
between a hill
08:39
and a mountain hill versus mountain
08:42
hills are small as you can see they're
08:45
not that
08:46
tall but a mountain wow look at that
08:49
that's really steep and
08:50
really high that's a mountain
08:53
some people argue and they say that's a
08:56
mountain
08:56
another person saying that's not a
08:58
mountain that's a hill
09:00
right it depends also where people are
09:03
from
09:03
if somebody's from a place that's very
09:05
flat they might think wow that's a
09:07
mountain
09:08
but people who live in the mountains
09:10
saying that's not a mountain
09:12
that's a mountain over there okay very
09:15
high
09:16
okay next one eight now these two people
09:19
are doing something interesting what
09:21
happened looks like some
09:22
earthquake maybe came through an
09:24
earthquake shook
09:25
the earth and and what did it do it made
09:28
small
09:29
openings in something what do we call
09:31
this here
09:32
this of course is called a crack cr
09:36
cur cur the c is hard
09:40
cr put them together cur
09:43
cur crack okay
09:46
a c k crack now that's maybe difficult
09:50
to pronounce
09:52
crack crack so when you see a small
09:55
opening
09:56
especially in stone or
09:59
even metal a little opening looks like
10:02
it might
10:03
break soon you see cracks if you see
10:06
cracks
10:07
be careful because that means that
10:09
something might
10:10
break okay or something is not strong
10:13
it got weak somehow so if you see a
10:16
crack
10:16
be careful it's not strong anymore
10:20
number nine wow this is pretty cool do
10:23
you have one of these
10:24
this is a it's like a puzzle board right
10:27
there are many different
10:29
what the outline of something here we
10:31
have an
10:32
outline what is that and we have a
10:35
different outline
10:36
these of course are different shapes
10:39
okay this is a circle a triangle a
10:42
square
10:43
those are different shapes okay so the
10:46
outline of something
10:48
is its shape next one number 10
10:52
looks like junior is wearing daddy's
10:55
clothing
10:56

10:59
for him
11:00
he looks kind of cute but it looks kind
11:02
of strange his feet are so big
11:04
right for his face but of course those
11:06
are his dad's shoes
11:07
his feet are probably very small inside
11:10
that big shoe
11:11
big another word for big is
11:14
large large the boy's clothes
11:18
are too large for him
11:21

11:27
that's very
11:28
big or you know huge huge is another
11:31
word you can use
