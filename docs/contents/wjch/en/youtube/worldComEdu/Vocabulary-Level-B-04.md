there's many types of gemstones
okay but when you take these gemstones

human resources in a mine but the mine
looked like this
it was an open pit mine right
it was not underground it was a pit
in the ground big trucks huge trucks so
mines can be
underground like this mines can also be
just a hole in the ground too so there's
different kinds
of minds okay
five to give money to buy things
when you give money to buy something
what are you doing you are paying
you pay money for something
pay money
for something something could be
toys could be games could be clothes
food right you pay money for something
be careful pay is an irregular verb we

banja banja
what can you say bright and full of
light it's
shiny right shiny is like punjab very

this is an interesting picture these
books look very
very old right a long time ago they
didn't make many books
and a lot of books have been destroyed
because they got
old there's been fires water
rain you know people throw them away so
very old books are hard to find some of
the original books
are hard to find what are they what can
we say about them
they are rare be careful pronunciation
you have two
r sounds r remember when you make r
sound your tongue is in the back of you
near the back of your throat
er er it kind of forms a u in the back
of your throat
er er from side to side
er rare rare
okay so one more time rare so
something that is hard to find is rare
okay next one oh that's cute right
kept you okay the little kitten right
little cat
the cat is not hard that means if you if
you touch the cat it's not a hard
surface it's not like
touching a table or or this screen it's
not
hard like that it's very what what's the
opposite
pandero of hard soft
sure if you put your hand on the kitten
it's very soft very nice right very soft
okay next one number nine okay looks
like somebody has been very busy today
they've
paid a lot of money for many things
to get something by paying money for it
what were they doing they were buying
they were buying many things
if you said shopping that's okay too
shop
right when people shop that's what she's
been doing
but she was buying things she was
shopping okay also she was paying money
for things she would buy buying things
now remember buy
is irregular it changes form
for the past by bought
bought what did you buy i
bought shoes i bought
a jacket i bought what did you buy
okay i bought something okay next one
number ten
what's this guy crazy what's he doing
don't do that hajima
joshua okay he's got to be careful
right that's crazy right he's going to
electrocute himself that's really
dangerous
don't do that right very
foolish we could say crazy
you could also say stupid
okay this boy is stupid i think in
korean you say pablo right is that right
pablo
pablo would be like stupid but crazy is
michiso
right michi so he's crazy
okay don't do that he's
crazy if he does that that's really nuts
you can all say nuts he is nuts
he's nuts he's crazy we do this to mean
he's crazy
okay very foolish don't do that okay
next one
hey these kids are having a good time
they're
not outside they're not outside they are
inside inside so pandero out
in inside is the same outside is
outside with uh trees and nature
grass dirt sky above you
that's outside inside is in a bus
or in a building in a in a home
in an office right you're inside not
outside
means you are inside okay next one
what is she doing well it's a very nice
thing that she has
she's imagining what will happen so
she's thinking in her mind
she's has pictures in her mind about
what
will happen in the future maybe
tomorrow next week next year
she's imagining she is guessing
she is guessing what will happen
it's a guess i don't know but i'm
guessing when you imagine what will
happen
you can guess you can also especially
when you say imagine what
will happen it's like predict
you can also say predict you predict
what will happen okay next one okay what
is this person doing looks like they're
in their garden right and they're
growing plants
so when you garden you make a hole in
the ground
with a tool right what are you doing
it's a very
simple word to dig dig
dig in the ground dig is an
irregular verb so it changes form
dig dug dug not a person's name
all right be careful because a person's
name can be
doug right hi doug
how are you but it doesn't mean doug as
in past tense of dig right
it's a different thing okay dig dug dug
okay next one this is under water some
very
pretty fish beautiful fish but if you
think about the surface of the water is
here and you go down and down and down
and down and down
if you get really far down to be far
down
where are you you are deep
to be deep under water deep
underground right you go down into
something
and to be far down in something
deep underwater deep underground
so to be very deep is to be far down
okay next one this is a beautiful
countryside right we have some
water here and the water is moving
right it's a natural flow of water
coming through somewhere
you've got land on both sides the water
is moving
what do we call this we call it a river
it's a river remember rivers are wide
right if it's really small and you could
step across it
or walk across it very easily it's not a
river
we would call it a stream
right a stream or you could call it a
creek
right those are very small but very wide
you have to swim across it right
that's a river okay that would be a
river
okay 16. water surrounded by land
so we have water here and on all sides
on all sides we can't see the rest of
picture but just imagine
there's land all around it well look at
that i drew that with my hand
okay all around there there's there's
land so water surrounded by land
is called a lake a lake
by the way it's interesting what do you
call land
surrounded
surrounded by water
right think about the opposite pandero
what do you call it
you would call that an island
right that would be an island so island
is the opposite pandero of lake
okay so water surrounded by land is a
lake land surrounded by
water is island okay
now we've taken a look at all of our
words let's do

12:20
the ground
12:20
with a tool right what are you doing
12:23
it's a very
12:24
simple word to dig dig
12:27
dig in the ground dig is an
12:30
irregular verb so it changes form
12:34
dig dug dug not a person's name
12:38
all right be careful because a person's
12:40
name can be
12:41
doug right hi doug
12:44
how are you but it doesn't mean doug as
12:47
in past tense of dig right
12:49
it's a different thing okay dig dug dug
12:53
okay next one this is under water some
12:57
very
12:57
pretty fish beautiful fish but if you
13:00
think about the surface of the water is
13:02
here and you go down and down and down
13:05
and down and down
13:06
if you get really far down to be far
13:08
down
13:09
where are you you are deep
13:12
to be deep under water deep
13:16
underground right you go down into
13:19
something
13:20
and to be far down in something
13:23
deep underwater deep underground
13:26
so to be very deep is to be far down
13:30
okay next one this is a beautiful
13:33
countryside right we have some
13:34
water here and the water is moving
13:37
right it's a natural flow of water
13:39
coming through somewhere
13:41
you've got land on both sides the water
13:44
is moving
13:45
what do we call this we call it a river
13:48
it's a river remember rivers are wide
13:52
right if it's really small and you could
13:54
step across it
13:55
or walk across it very easily it's not a
13:58
river
13:58
we would call it a stream
14:02
right a stream or you could call it a
14:04
creek
14:05
right those are very small but very wide
14:09
you have to swim across it right
14:11
that's a river okay that would be a
14:13
river
14:15

by the way it's interesting what do you
14:41
call land
14:43
surrounded
14:47
surrounded by water
14:50
right think about the opposite pandero
14:53
what do you call it
14:54
you would call that an island
14:58
right that would be an island so island
15:00
is the opposite pandero of lake
