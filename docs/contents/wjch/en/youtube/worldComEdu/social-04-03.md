hello everybody and welcome back to
american textbook reading my name is
brian stewart
and today we're going over social
studies book for
lesson three and lesson three is about
we are part of the world so if you think
about it
we are all one big community in the
world
so in this unit we will discover
different
types of communities and types of
aid communities can give to each other
so let's begin as usual with the
vocabulary the first word is
nation nation simply means a country
right
so what country are you in right now
what country are you from
are you watching this from korea which
is a country
are you watching this from turkey that's
a country as well
are you watching this from the united
states also another country
so of course the world is divided into
many countries
and we call these countries we can also
say nations
disaster a disaster oh it's terrible
a disaster is something really
bad it's a very bad event what are types
of disasters
well fires like a big fire a flood
we see sometimes in the news certain
parts of the world have terrible floods
when it rains too much or earthquakes
very
terrible events that happen and usually
many people lose their lives
and many other people are injured or
lose their homes
or in danger because they have no food
to eat
after some type of disaster so disasters
are really
bad events
aid aid simply means help it's a more
formal word it's a fancier word than
help
help is a very common word but aid is a
little bit more of a
formal word aid just means help or
support
so aid can be a noun it can also be a
verb
aid as a noun is the things that you
give to somebody to help them
especially in a disaster but you can
also aid
somebody that's a verb that means to
help them so of course help can be a
noun or a verb
as well but aid is just more formal than
help
supply supply
can also be a noun or a verb in this
case
it's a noun because it means things that
are needed
such as food medicines or clothes
and usually when we talk about you know
if we say
supplies things we usually say supplies
right so supplies when you're talking
about a noun
and let's say you want to give some
things that are needed
to another person they had a fire in
their house right you know the family
you know they had a fire
they lost their home so you say well gee
you know i want to help them out so
let's give them water let's give them
food let's give them blankets clothing
those are supplies okay so supply is a
count noun
and we usually use it in the plural
because you don't just give one supply
you give
supplies to people and it's various
things food
medicine clothes those are supplies
okay next we have
discuss disqus means to talk about
something
to make a decision and be careful
because many
of my korean students will use the
preposition about after discuss
but do not do that that's
wrong because disgust means to talk
about
so when you say let's discuss about the
problem
you're saying let's talk about about the
problem why would you say about twice
you don't need to
discuss already means talk about so just
say
we should discuss the problem
we should discuss our plans
but do not use the preposition about
after discuss
it sounds very strange and native
speakers do not do that
so please if you don't get into that
habit
okay don't use about after discuss
it's just discuss discuss the problem
discuss the plans discuss the meeting
discuss
something okay good next we have
meeting meeting of course is when many
people get together
and they talk about something they
discuss something
an occasion an occasion is like an event
or a time
when people and you can see many people
a meeting could just be two people of
course you could have a two-person
meeting
this is more typical though of a
business meeting many people get
together
and why do they get together because
they want to discuss
an issue they want to discuss something
and usually they
come to a decision not always but
usually they try to come to a decision
they try to decide something so decide
is a verb
decision is a noun so we would we want
to discuss something in order to make a
decision
or in order to decide uh something a
course of action
next we have be made up of
four words right but this is a
phrasal verb that means
that various parts combine
to make a whole be made up of it says be
composed of but what is composed of mean
composed of means that you you have many
different parts and you put them all
together
and that makes a whole thing and you can
say it's made up of
this is a good example because if you
think of a hamburger
right what is a hamburger made up
of a hamburger has many different parts
it has bread
it has vegetables tomato it has meat it
has more vegetables
pickles and lettuce and it has bread on
the top
so it is made up of all these things
it's missing something
what is it missing ketchup
there's no ketchup okay but many people
put ketchup on their hamburgers
so a hamburger is made up of many
different things
and of course you could put different
things on your hamburgers some people
get very creative
with what they make their hamburgers up
with
okay so to be made up of is to
be composed of or to contain many
different parts to make a whole thing
okay finally we have
keep in touch this is very important
also a phrase it's kind of an idiomatic
expression
keep in touch means to keep
communicating
that's a big word communicating talking
with
somebody so if you have a friend
and your friend moves away to a
different town or
a different nation you don't want to
lose that friend
so you want to keep in touch with that
person so maybe sometimes you send them
email maybe you call them on the phone
that's a very old phone
on your cell phone or you text them you
can text
internationally these days as well but
you want to stay in touch
stay in touch keep in touch means the
same thing
so stay in touch keep in touch it
doesn't matter they both mean the same
thing
it means you don't lose touch with
a friend who has moved away friend or
relative
who has moved away okay so that is our
vocabulary for this lesson
let's talk about the two main ideas in
this lesson the first idea
is the idea of our world remember at the
beginning of this lesson i said
we all live in the same community the
same global
community but when you think about it
you can break that community down into
different
parts or different groups and from the
smallest
to the largest so the smallest
community or part of your world is your
home
it includes your parents your brothers
and your sisters
maybe some extended family members aunts
uncles right maybe your grandma grandma
lives with you
that is your home that's that's your
very small
community then if we get bigger from
that
think about your neighborhood think
about the families who live
next to you your neighbors your
neighbors live
in your neighborhood a neighborhood of
course is the area around
your house or apartment or or wherever
you're living in
right and that is your neighborhood it's
a small community
of many families living next to each
other
then we have community so a community is
made up of many different neighborhoods
and a community might be a village a
town
or a city right those are different
types of communities but even in a city
you might have smaller districts in the
city those are separate communities
so community is larger than a
neighborhood but
maybe smaller than a city could be
inside the city or it could be the whole
city
but it's just you know a group of people
living in the same
area a larger area than just a
neighborhood
an estate now different countries will
divide the
the area inside their country using
different
names some countries use the word uh
province for example to divide their
nation into different
areas in america they use the word state
of course
united states of america it's many
different states that are
united and form the nation of america
so a state is a subdivision or a
division
of a large country and of course in many
other countries they don't use state
they use
province or they might use an even
another word than that
to describe the the smaller regions
within
a nation and of course the last one
nation
nation of course is a country and
nations can be small
or they can be very large right nations
can be small like uh
was it luxembourg i'm thinking of or you
know very small
some very small european countries or
nations
or they could be very large like india
huge nation or russia
very big land mass okay
now that's not the final part though we
also have
other nations and you see a bunch of
flags there looks like that's might be
in front of the united nations
which is a group of it's a political
organization where many nations get
together and they work because they're
part of the world or global community
so nations all the nations the world
also form another type of community
and that is of course the world okay so
nations work together
to help each other and that is the whole
point of the united nations
which is an important organization
united
nations so basically this
organization the united nations
headquartered in new york city
they are many member states
they call them member states but it's
actually member nations get together and
discuss
uh how to help each other and how to
solve problems that everybody has
in the world okay next we have types of
aid now of course if we all live in the
same community
it's important to help each other
whether our community is small
or whether a community is larger or our
community is global
right so what are different types of aid
and remember
aid means help well if you want to help
somebody you can
send them different you can help them in
different ways
one way you could send them money money
of course is very useful because
it it doesn't take you don't need to
transport it you can send it
electronically
and it can be used in every part of the
world to purchase things that are needed
like food medicine
shelter things like that you can also
send services and in fact many countries
do send services let's say there's an
earthquake in a in a
in a nation many countries will send
like medical services
emergency medical people doctors emts
things like that and ambulances
equipment
so they'll send medical service to that
area to help that's a type of aid
they might also send military troops
especially if there's an area of the
world
where two groups are fighting and
there's no real government to control
the area
unfortunately some regions of the world
are like that
there's a very weak or no government
so the people living there they really
have no protection from
bad people in their community so other
countries will send military troops
to help keep peace and act like
policemen
until that region can develop their own
police force
and military to keep the peace in their
own community
so those are types of services you can
also send
goods as aid right we talked about that
before
supplies right we usually say supplies
so what are supplies of course
food is a type of supply or good that
you can send as
aid but medicine is very important
because
especially after disaster or flooding
people might get sick there might be
disease
in an area so you want to make sure that
people have
enough medicine to prevent disease and
keep
everyone healthy so these are all
different types of aid
money services and goods
okay
let's do the reading now as usual i'll
read it out loud
please repeat after me focus on
pronunciation
and also remember the vocabulary words
that we went over
at the beginning of this lesson are you
guys ready
here we go we are all
part of the world and the world
is made up of many different
nations
these nations need each other
to survive and get through
difficult times therefore
nations should work together to help
each other
during difficult times like when there
is a disaster nations give
aid and supplies to the nation
having trouble
in 2011 when japan
had a terrible earthquake many countries
sent aid to help the japanese people
the nations of the world should do
some things to help each other well
for example it is important for
nations to keep in touch with each other
this can happen if the leaders of
nations
meet regularly and discuss
problems in the world
discussing problems means that the
nation's leaders
will learn to help the people in trouble
from the meetings
okay let's take a look
at how this reading passage was
organized
what kind of organizational model does
it follow
well this follows the idea of main idea
and details again
you have a main idea and then you
support that main idea
with many different details or examples
in this case what is the main idea the
main idea is
nations should work together to beep
each other
what should nations do actually what
should people do
you know on an individual basis or on a
family basis
community-wide basis national basis
nations should work together of course
to
help each other we are all
in the same boat we are all in the same
world
we should all work to help each other
out so
when there is a blank in a nation
other nations give blank and supplies to
the nation
so what type of situation
happens in which other nations give
supplies to that nation
remember we talked about a situation
remember 2011 they talked about an
earthquake in japan
an earthquake is a type of what it is a
type of
disaster disaster
so there are many kinds of disasters
earthquakes fires floods
unfortunately and these things happen
every year
so when there is a disaster in a nation
other nations give what they give
supplies
and they also give you know in the
reading passage it says that they give
beep and supplies although you could
argue that
supplies is a type of aid
right so aid aid
and supplies but really aid aided
supplies
is a type of aid so that's okay but you
know they give help
and supplies to the nation okay aid
next one leaders of nations meet
regularly
and be problems in the world what do
they
do about problems of course they can't
really take action right
right right away first they have to
figure out
or decide what action to take before you
decide
you need to talk about
or discuss the problems remember
discuss not discuss about just
discuss so be careful with that one
that's a common mistake
and discuss problems in the world now if
you use talk of course you're going to
say talk about
meet regularly and talk about problems
in the world
but with discuss just discuss problems
in the world okay last one
the nation's leaders will help i'm sorry
the nation's leaders
will learn to help the people in trouble
from the beep okay when they're meeting
and they're discussing the problems
of course their meeting meeting what do
we call that
we call that a meeting from the meetings
from the meetings that was in the
reading passage
from the meetings okay so meetings
because
they get together regularly there they
get together often so they have many
meetings
because unfortunately there's many
disasters but of course the nation's
leaders don't just get together
in times of disaster they also get
together regularly to talk about other
types of problems
or to talk about how they can help each
other or work
together to solve problems that might
occur in the future
and this is basically it sounds you know
they didn't mention it specifically
but obviously they're talking about the
united nations here especially in this
one and we just call that the u.n
right the united nations okay so
this lesson was about the fact that we
live in different types of communities
right we live in small communities our
home
but there's also larger types of
communities neighborhood
community uh states
nation world right so
we all are connected and we all should
think about how can we help each other
you know
sometimes bad things happen
we can try to prevent them but they'll
happen and
how do we help other people who are
having a bad time
or who experienced a disaster this
passage was about what kind of aid or
what kind of supplies
how can we help other people when they
are
in need and it's very important to help
other people even if they're
in a different community even if they're
in a different nation because when you
think about it
we are all really in the same community
the same global community our or the
worldwide
community so it's important to help each
other out because who knows
sometimes you might need their help but
of course if we help each other out
usually or normally then we can all live
together
much more productively okay
well that was this lesson thank you for
studying with me hope you learned a lot
of good words
and maybe some good ideas to think about
and read more about
anyway thank you for studying with me
we'll see you in the next lesson
take care everybody bye-bye
you

hello everybody and welcome back to
00:10
american textbook reading my name is
00:12
brian stewart
00:13
and today we're going over social
00:14
studies book for
00:16
lesson three and lesson three is about
00:19
we are part of the world so if you think
00:23
about it
00:24
we are all one big community in the
00:27
world
00:27
so in this unit we will discover
00:30
different
00:31
types of communities and types of
00:34
aid communities can give to each other
00:40
so let's begin as usual with the
00:42
vocabulary the first word is
00:45
nation nation simply means a country
00:48
right
00:49
so what country are you in right now
00:51
what country are you from
00:53
are you watching this from korea which
00:55
is a country
00:56
are you watching this from turkey that's
00:59
a country as well
01:00
are you watching this from the united
01:02
states also another country
01:04
so of course the world is divided into
01:06
many countries
01:08
and we call these countries we can also
01:10
say nations
01:14
disaster a disaster oh it's terrible
01:17
a disaster is something really
01:20
bad it's a very bad event what are types
01:23
of disasters
01:24
well fires like a big fire a flood
01:28
we see sometimes in the news certain
01:30
parts of the world have terrible floods
01:32
when it rains too much or earthquakes
01:35
very
01:36
terrible events that happen and usually
01:39
many people lose their lives
01:41
and many other people are injured or
01:44
lose their homes
01:45
or in danger because they have no food
01:48
to eat
01:48
after some type of disaster so disasters
01:52
are really
01:53
bad events
01:56
aid aid simply means help it's a more
02:00
formal word it's a fancier word than
02:03
help
02:04
help is a very common word but aid is a
02:07
little bit more of a
02:08
formal word aid just means help or
02:10
support
02:11
so aid can be a noun it can also be a
02:14
verb
02:14
aid as a noun is the things that you
02:18
give to somebody to help them
02:19
especially in a disaster but you can
02:22
also aid
02:23
somebody that's a verb that means to
02:24
help them so of course help can be a
02:27
noun or a verb
02:28
as well but aid is just more formal than
02:31
help
02:33
supply supply
02:37
can also be a noun or a verb in this
02:39
case
02:40
it's a noun because it means things that
02:43
are needed
02:44
such as food medicines or clothes
02:47
and usually when we talk about you know
02:50
if we say
02:51
supplies things we usually say supplies
02:54
right so supplies when you're talking
02:57
about a noun
02:58
and let's say you want to give some
03:01
things that are needed
03:03
to another person they had a fire in
03:05
their house right you know the family
03:07
you know they had a fire
03:08
they lost their home so you say well gee
03:10
you know i want to help them out so
03:12
let's give them water let's give them
03:14
food let's give them blankets clothing
03:16
those are supplies okay so supply is a
03:20
count noun
03:21
and we usually use it in the plural
03:23
because you don't just give one supply
03:25
you give
03:26
supplies to people and it's various
03:28
things food
03:29
medicine clothes those are supplies
03:32
okay next we have
03:35
discuss disqus means to talk about
03:38
something
03:39
to make a decision and be careful
03:42
because many
03:43
of my korean students will use the
03:46
preposition about after discuss
03:50
but do not do that that's
03:53
wrong because disgust means to talk
03:55
about
03:56
so when you say let's discuss about the
03:59
problem
04:00
you're saying let's talk about about the
04:02
problem why would you say about twice
04:04
you don't need to
04:05
discuss already means talk about so just
04:08
say
04:09
we should discuss the problem
04:12
we should discuss our plans
04:15
but do not use the preposition about
04:18
after discuss
04:19
it sounds very strange and native
04:21
speakers do not do that
04:23
so please if you don't get into that
04:26
habit
04:27
okay don't use about after discuss
04:30
it's just discuss discuss the problem
04:33
discuss the plans discuss the meeting
04:36
discuss
04:37
something okay good next we have
04:40
meeting meeting of course is when many
04:43
people get together
04:44
and they talk about something they
04:46
discuss something
04:48
an occasion an occasion is like an event
04:51
or a time
04:52
when people and you can see many people
04:55
a meeting could just be two people of
04:57
course you could have a two-person
04:59
meeting
04:59
this is more typical though of a
05:01
business meeting many people get
05:03
together
05:04
and why do they get together because
05:05
they want to discuss
05:07
an issue they want to discuss something
05:10
and usually they
05:11
come to a decision not always but
05:14
usually they try to come to a decision
05:16
they try to decide something so decide
05:20
is a verb
05:21
decision is a noun so we would we want
05:23
to discuss something in order to make a
05:26
decision
05:27
or in order to decide uh something a
05:30
course of action
05:33
next we have be made up of
05:37
four words right but this is a
05:42
phrasal verb that means
05:45
that various parts combine
05:48
to make a whole be made up of it says be
05:52
composed of but what is composed of mean
05:54
composed of means that you you have many
05:56
different parts and you put them all
05:58
together
05:59
and that makes a whole thing and you can
06:02
say it's made up of
06:03
this is a good example because if you
06:05
think of a hamburger
06:06
right what is a hamburger made up
06:09
of a hamburger has many different parts
06:12
it has bread
06:14
it has vegetables tomato it has meat it
06:17
has more vegetables
06:18
pickles and lettuce and it has bread on
06:20
the top
06:21
so it is made up of all these things
06:23
it's missing something
06:25
what is it missing ketchup
06:28
there's no ketchup okay but many people
06:31
put ketchup on their hamburgers
06:32
so a hamburger is made up of many
06:35
different things
06:35
and of course you could put different
06:37
things on your hamburgers some people
06:39
get very creative
06:40
with what they make their hamburgers up
06:43
with
06:43
okay so to be made up of is to
06:47
be composed of or to contain many
06:50
different parts to make a whole thing
06:52
okay finally we have
06:56
keep in touch this is very important
06:59
also a phrase it's kind of an idiomatic
07:02
expression
07:03
keep in touch means to keep
07:05
communicating
07:06
that's a big word communicating talking
07:09
with
07:09
somebody so if you have a friend
07:12
and your friend moves away to a
07:14
different town or
07:16
a different nation you don't want to
07:18
lose that friend
07:19
so you want to keep in touch with that
07:21
person so maybe sometimes you send them
07:23
email maybe you call them on the phone
07:26
that's a very old phone
07:28
on your cell phone or you text them you
07:30
can text
07:31
internationally these days as well but
07:33
you want to stay in touch
07:35
stay in touch keep in touch means the
07:38
same thing
07:39
so stay in touch keep in touch it
07:42
doesn't matter they both mean the same
07:43
thing
07:44
it means you don't lose touch with
07:47
a friend who has moved away friend or
07:50
relative
07:51
who has moved away okay so that is our
07:54
vocabulary for this lesson
08:00
let's talk about the two main ideas in
08:02
this lesson the first idea
08:03
is the idea of our world remember at the
08:06
beginning of this lesson i said
08:08
we all live in the same community the
08:11
same global
08:12
community but when you think about it
08:14
you can break that community down into
08:16
different
08:17
parts or different groups and from the
08:20
smallest
08:21
to the largest so the smallest
08:24
community or part of your world is your
08:27
home
08:28
it includes your parents your brothers
08:30
and your sisters
08:31
maybe some extended family members aunts
08:34
uncles right maybe your grandma grandma
08:37
lives with you
08:38
that is your home that's that's your
08:40
very small
08:41
community then if we get bigger from
08:43
that
08:44
think about your neighborhood think
08:46
about the families who live
08:47
next to you your neighbors your
08:50
neighbors live
08:51
in your neighborhood a neighborhood of
08:53
course is the area around
08:55
your house or apartment or or wherever
08:58
you're living in
08:59
right and that is your neighborhood it's
09:00
a small community
09:02
of many families living next to each
09:05
other
09:06
then we have community so a community is
09:09
made up of many different neighborhoods
09:12
and a community might be a village a
09:14
town
09:15
or a city right those are different
09:17
types of communities but even in a city
09:20
you might have smaller districts in the
09:22
city those are separate communities
09:24
so community is larger than a
09:26
neighborhood but
09:28
maybe smaller than a city could be
09:30
inside the city or it could be the whole
09:31
city
09:32
but it's just you know a group of people
09:34
living in the same
09:35
area a larger area than just a
09:37
neighborhood
09:39
an estate now different countries will
09:41
divide the
09:43
the area inside their country using
09:46
different
09:46
names some countries use the word uh
09:50
province for example to divide their
09:53
nation into different
09:54
areas in america they use the word state
09:58
of course
09:59
united states of america it's many
10:02
different states that are
10:04
united and form the nation of america
10:07
so a state is a subdivision or a
10:10
division
10:11
of a large country and of course in many
10:13
other countries they don't use state
10:15
they use
10:15
province or they might use an even
10:17
another word than that
10:19
to describe the the smaller regions
10:22
within
10:23
a nation and of course the last one
10:26
nation
10:27
nation of course is a country and
10:29
nations can be small
10:30
or they can be very large right nations
10:33
can be small like uh
10:35
was it luxembourg i'm thinking of or you
10:38
know very small
10:39
some very small european countries or
10:42
nations
10:43
or they could be very large like india
10:45
huge nation or russia
10:48
very big land mass okay
10:52
now that's not the final part though we
10:55
also have
10:55
other nations and you see a bunch of
10:57
flags there looks like that's might be
10:59
in front of the united nations
11:02
which is a group of it's a political
11:05
organization where many nations get
11:08
together and they work because they're
11:09
part of the world or global community
11:12
so nations all the nations the world
11:14
also form another type of community
11:17
and that is of course the world okay so
11:20
nations work together
11:21
to help each other and that is the whole
11:24
point of the united nations
11:26
which is an important organization
11:28
united
11:30
nations so basically this
11:34
organization the united nations
11:36
headquartered in new york city
11:38
they are many member states
11:42
they call them member states but it's
11:43
actually member nations get together and
11:45
discuss
11:46
uh how to help each other and how to
11:48
solve problems that everybody has
11:51
in the world okay next we have types of
11:55
aid now of course if we all live in the
11:57
same community
11:58
it's important to help each other
12:00
whether our community is small
12:01
or whether a community is larger or our
12:03
community is global
12:05
right so what are different types of aid
12:08
and remember
12:08
aid means help well if you want to help
12:11
somebody you can
12:11
send them different you can help them in
12:14
different ways
12:15
one way you could send them money money
12:17
of course is very useful because
12:20
it it doesn't take you don't need to
12:23
transport it you can send it
12:24
electronically
12:25
and it can be used in every part of the
12:28
world to purchase things that are needed
12:30
like food medicine
12:31
shelter things like that you can also
12:35
send services and in fact many countries
12:38
do send services let's say there's an
12:40
earthquake in a in a
12:42
in a nation many countries will send
12:45
like medical services
12:47
emergency medical people doctors emts
12:50
things like that and ambulances
12:52
equipment
12:53
so they'll send medical service to that
12:55
area to help that's a type of aid
12:57
they might also send military troops
13:00
especially if there's an area of the
13:02
world
13:03
where two groups are fighting and
13:05
there's no real government to control
13:07
the area
13:08
unfortunately some regions of the world
13:10
are like that
13:11
there's a very weak or no government
13:15
so the people living there they really
13:17
have no protection from
13:19
bad people in their community so other
13:22
countries will send military troops
13:24
to help keep peace and act like
13:26
policemen
13:27
until that region can develop their own
13:29
police force
13:30
and military to keep the peace in their
13:33
own community
13:34
so those are types of services you can
13:37
also send
13:38
goods as aid right we talked about that
13:41
before
13:41
supplies right we usually say supplies
13:44
so what are supplies of course
13:45
food is a type of supply or good that
13:48
you can send as
13:49
aid but medicine is very important
13:52
because
13:53
especially after disaster or flooding
13:55
people might get sick there might be
13:57
disease
13:58
in an area so you want to make sure that
14:00
people have
14:01
enough medicine to prevent disease and
14:04
keep
14:04
everyone healthy so these are all
14:06
different types of aid
14:07
money services and goods
14:11
okay
14:14
let's do the reading now as usual i'll
14:17
read it out loud
14:18
please repeat after me focus on
14:21
pronunciation
14:22
and also remember the vocabulary words
14:24
that we went over
14:26
at the beginning of this lesson are you
14:28
guys ready
14:29
here we go we are all
14:32
part of the world and the world
14:36
is made up of many different
14:40
nations
14:43
these nations need each other
14:46
to survive and get through
14:50
difficult times therefore
14:53
nations should work together to help
14:57
each other
15:00
during difficult times like when there
15:03
is a disaster nations give
15:07
aid and supplies to the nation
15:11
having trouble
15:14
in 2011 when japan
15:17
had a terrible earthquake many countries
15:21
sent aid to help the japanese people
15:28
the nations of the world should do
15:31
some things to help each other well
15:35
for example it is important for
15:38
nations to keep in touch with each other
15:42
this can happen if the leaders of
15:45
nations
15:47
meet regularly and discuss
15:50
problems in the world
15:54
discussing problems means that the
15:57
nation's leaders
15:59
will learn to help the people in trouble
16:03
from the meetings
16:06
okay let's take a look
16:10
at how this reading passage was
16:12
organized
16:14
what kind of organizational model does
16:16
it follow
16:17
well this follows the idea of main idea
16:20
and details again
16:21
you have a main idea and then you
16:23
support that main idea
16:24
with many different details or examples
16:27
in this case what is the main idea the
16:30
main idea is
16:31
nations should work together to beep
16:34
each other
16:35
what should nations do actually what
16:37
should people do
16:38
you know on an individual basis or on a
16:41
family basis
16:42
community-wide basis national basis
16:46
nations should work together of course
16:48
to
16:49
help each other we are all
16:52
in the same boat we are all in the same
16:56
world
16:58
we should all work to help each other
16:59
out so
17:01
when there is a blank in a nation
17:04
other nations give blank and supplies to
17:07
the nation
17:08
so what type of situation
17:11
happens in which other nations give
17:14
supplies to that nation
17:15
remember we talked about a situation
17:17
remember 2011 they talked about an
17:19
earthquake in japan
17:21
an earthquake is a type of what it is a
17:24
type of
17:24
disaster disaster
17:29
so there are many kinds of disasters
17:32
earthquakes fires floods
17:33
unfortunately and these things happen
17:36
every year
17:37
so when there is a disaster in a nation
17:40
other nations give what they give
17:42
supplies
17:43
and they also give you know in the
17:45
reading passage it says that they give
17:47
beep and supplies although you could
17:50
argue that
17:51
supplies is a type of aid
17:54
right so aid aid
17:57
and supplies but really aid aided
18:00
supplies
18:01
is a type of aid so that's okay but you
18:04
know they give help
18:05
and supplies to the nation okay aid
18:08
next one leaders of nations meet
18:11
regularly
18:12
and be problems in the world what do
18:14
they
18:15
do about problems of course they can't
18:17
really take action right
18:19
right right away first they have to
18:21
figure out
18:22
or decide what action to take before you
18:25
decide
18:26
you need to talk about
18:29
or discuss the problems remember
18:33
discuss not discuss about just
18:36
discuss so be careful with that one
18:39
that's a common mistake
18:41
and discuss problems in the world now if
18:44
you use talk of course you're going to
18:45
say talk about
18:46
meet regularly and talk about problems
18:49
in the world
18:50
but with discuss just discuss problems
18:53
in the world okay last one
18:56
the nation's leaders will help i'm sorry
18:59
the nation's leaders
19:00
will learn to help the people in trouble
19:04
from the beep okay when they're meeting
19:07
and they're discussing the problems
19:09
of course their meeting meeting what do
19:12
we call that
19:13
we call that a meeting from the meetings
19:15
from the meetings that was in the
19:17
reading passage
19:18
from the meetings okay so meetings
19:20
because
19:21
they get together regularly there they
19:23
get together often so they have many
19:25
meetings
19:25
because unfortunately there's many
19:27
disasters but of course the nation's
19:29
leaders don't just get together
19:31
in times of disaster they also get
19:33
together regularly to talk about other
19:35
types of problems
19:37
or to talk about how they can help each
19:39
other or work
19:40
together to solve problems that might
19:43
occur in the future
19:45
and this is basically it sounds you know
19:47
they didn't mention it specifically
19:49
but obviously they're talking about the
19:51
united nations here especially in this
19:53
one and we just call that the u.n
19:55
right the united nations okay so
19:58
this lesson was about the fact that we
20:01
live in different types of communities
20:03
right we live in small communities our
20:05
home
20:06
but there's also larger types of
20:08
communities neighborhood
20:10
community uh states
20:13
nation world right so
20:16
we all are connected and we all should
20:19
think about how can we help each other
20:21
you know
20:23
sometimes bad things happen
20:26
we can try to prevent them but they'll
20:28
happen and
20:30
how do we help other people who are
20:31
having a bad time
20:33
or who experienced a disaster this
20:36
passage was about what kind of aid or
20:39
what kind of supplies
20:40
how can we help other people when they
20:43
are
20:43
in need and it's very important to help
20:45
other people even if they're
20:47
in a different community even if they're
20:49
in a different nation because when you
20:51
think about it
20:52
we are all really in the same community
20:55
the same global community our or the
20:58
worldwide
20:59
community so it's important to help each
21:01
other out because who knows
21:02
sometimes you might need their help but
21:04
of course if we help each other out
21:06
usually or normally then we can all live
21:09
together
21:10
much more productively okay
21:14
well that was this lesson thank you for
21:16
studying with me hope you learned a lot
21:17
of good words
21:18
and maybe some good ideas to think about
21:20
and read more about
21:22
anyway thank you for studying with me
21:24
we'll see you in the next lesson
21:25
take care everybody bye-bye
21:34
