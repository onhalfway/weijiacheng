think about your favorite
sports teams so we think about
playing favorites we're going to think
about who are your favorite sports teams
and what do people do to support
their favorite sports teams well we can
say a lot of things about that of course
when we think about our famous
our favorite sports teams koreans are
very
enthusiastic about cheering for their
favorite sports teams
for example the korean national team
especially for example the korean
national
soccer team do you remember the 2002
world cup
maybe it's too long ago you don't
remember but
at that time it was really really
a big event in korea this is at kwanghwa
moon square
right a kwanghwa moon in downtown seoul
it's
crazy oh i'm sorry it's notwanga moon
kwango moon is over here choki
this is city hall this is city hall i
forgot because they changed the building
it looks different now but look at this
plaza
wow there's so many people i mean
there's a street here
there's another street here but there's
so many people you can't even see the
streets no cars today
right because there are so many people
cheering
for the 2002 soccer
world soccer tournament right which is
called the
world cup the world soccer cup so it's
amazing it was really amazing i was
actually in korea
at this time i remember driving over
this is kwanga moon over here remember
driving by
my friend was on the back of my
motorcycle is taking pictures
it was pretty interesting and so yeah it
was really amazing so many people came
out
and cheered for their soccer team okay
people will go crazy
supporting their their team right these
people here
what country has blue people no i'm just
kidding they're not really blue
they're using blue paint on their faces
to support the color of their favorite
team
where are they from well we can see from
their headbands that it looks like
japanese that's the
the flag of japan right the the sun the
rising sun
and uh these guys are japanese sports
fans
okay so they're out cheering their team
and you see they're really enthusiastic
about
cheering for their team they wear crazy
costumes and they paint their faces or
their bodies
different colors these guys are japanese
fans
we can whoa we can also see other
examples right who are these guys
blue and yellow right and these three
people here
they look like they're aliens from
another world right no i'm just kidding
they're wearing some kind of thing over
their head they're from
sweden of course that's the swedish flag
so these are
swedish fans again probably soccer fans
who are cheering for their team look at
this guy he really
he really went all out painting his his
whole almost his whole body
for uh for the game this kid where is
this kid from
you can see the flag of america the
stars and the stripes so he's an
american fan
and these people over here where are
they from well we know this
red cross we've seen it so many times
before
that of course is the symbol for
switzerland so we can see
fans from different countries will go
crazy kind of they'll do
very impressive or very unusual things
to show their support for their home
team
for their home team or whatever team
they're favorite of
now of course these are international
sporting events
within the nation inside of america for
example
people won't dress their won't paint the
american flag on their bodies because
everybody's american
but like the chicago if somebody's from
chicago and somebody's from new york
they'll wear the colors or paint their
their bodies in the colors of their
home or city team okay and they will do
that or they're aware of the jerseys the
famous
uh jerseys jersey is the sports shirt
that the athlete wears
with the number on the back of their
favorite player
on that team and that's what fans will
do they'll show their support
okay well before we go into the reading
of course we need to learn some
vocabulary so let's take a look at some
vocabulary having to do
with supporting your favorite team our
first word is of course
a group of people working together look
at these big guys here they're very big
aren't they
they look strong they look tough this of
course is a football team when i say
football
i mean american football some of course
europeans say football is
soccer they don't use the word soccer
but in america if you say football
you're talking about this you're not
talking about soccer you're talking
about wearing the helmet
the football throwing it it's a
different sport but anyway
whether it's football soccer or european
football
what do you have you have a group of
people working together of course we say
that's a team and we talked about that
before you will support your favorite
team next word beyond at a greater point
so if you're here and you want to go
beyond you want to go
further down the road the word of course
is further
you want to go beyond you want to go at
a greater point than where you are now
of course further doesn't just mean
distance it can also mean
you know if you want to uh improve your
studies you want to prove something
further right or you you have are there
any further questions
is another uh very common expression are
there more questions are there questions
beyond
right now that we can explore these
different areas so in some cases we have
different
expressions with further are there any
further questions
we have to go a little further okay of
course we can get confused with
farther if you say farther a r t h er
you're only talking about distance
farther we have much
farther to go today okay number three
a person who supports a team or a person
we talked about that right
these people who are dressed in
different colors in their team
uh these people this is like i said
before this is
inside america they're not they're not
dressed in the national flag of america
they're dressed in the colors of their
team probably their college team
and of course they're called fans of
course
that's it right here fan a fan is a
person who
is supporting their team now you can
have a super fan
super fans most people are normal fans
right they cheer for their team they go
out
but super fans they really go crazy
okay okay number four a small tasty meal
so sometimes between breakfast and lunch
you get hungry
especially between lunch and dinner you
might get hungry what do you want
you want to eat a snack a snack please
remember that
snack is countable let's have a snack
not let's have snack no let's have a
snack did you have a snack
uh this afternoon okay what do you want
to have for
a snack okay so snack is countable in
this case
we say it's like it's but even though if
you have
like many pieces of fruit and maybe a
candy bar
you call it all a snack so a snack is
kind of like the entire thing that you
eat
during that short time that's a snack
but usually it's just one thing like a
candy bar
or a piece of fruit okay number five
to help or to hold up now if you help
somebody or if you're holding something
up what are you doing
you are supporting you're supporting
that this is what fans do
fans support their teams but you can
also
use support in many different ideas
for example if a house is built on a
hill you might have
like pillars supporting the house right
it just means to hold something up
so support can be used in different
ideas in this case though
we're talking about supporting a team
right you're showing
your um your energy or your
support for that team number six
very serious and extreme if something's
very serious
very extreme we say it is intense
sometimes of course
at the international level at the world
cup level
soccer players are the best in the world
their play is very
intense they're very serious about their
sport
and sometimes they do some extreme moves
right like maybe they kick backwards
right the goal is behind them they kick
and the ball goes behind them into the
gold that is extreme that's very intense
and of course as fans we like to see
those intense moments
that's what makes the game very exciting
seven having a lot of energy so if
somebody has a lot of energy
we say they're energetic that's very
easy right
energy is the noun energetic
is the adjective he has
a lot of energy he is
energetic okay so that would be the
adjective for energy
eight to quit or to stop
trying okay if somebody stops trying
like uh
they're boxing and somebody falls down
they can't get up they say i've had
enough what do they do
they give up sometimes when kids fight
they shouldn't fight really but
sometimes you'll see the kids will hold
the other kid on the ground say do you
give up
or usually brothers when they're
fighting right one
one brother say will you give up you
know stop fighting
right let's stop fighting do you but
they want the other person to give up
or sometimes in a video game you say oh
it's hopeless i don't want to play to
the end
because i know i can't win so i give up
that means to quit or to stop trying i
give up or
do you give up okay number nine
an entertaining and difficult action
what is an
entertaining entertaining and difficult
action
we can say a trick a trick is something
that magicians this is a magic
trick right we usually think of trick in
terms of magic
some famous magicians will do tricks
that are difficult to do but they're
very
entertaining it's also difficult to
figure out how did he do that
right and that is a trick number ten
what the heck is that okay that's not a
real animal right it's
an animal a personality that is a symbol
of a team
so somebody who's a symbol of a team you
have different symbols for different
teams in korea right
but we call those things mascot a
mascot so different teams will have
different
uh animals or like a person in a funny
costume
and they are the mascot so usually it's
an animal like bears or eagles
dolphins something like that they will
be the mascot
for the team the next one number 11
is to walk over violently
of course this is acting right here
she's walking over this guy
violently she's trampling this guy
but usually when you think about this
word trample
it's not just one person it's like a
crowd of people
many people and maybe they're scared or
maybe they're excited
or they're very enthusiastic and they
don't
think about safety right they're just
running as a group
and sometimes this can be very dangerous
especially in
crowded or narrow areas where many
people are moving
and somebody falls down other people
might not even know that person is there
because there's so many people
they will trample the person who's on
the ground so usually this
is not you know it's usually many people
walking over
another person or it doesn't even have
to be a person you can trample the
ground
if there's grass and many people trample
the grass
then they walk over the grass maybe they
ruin the grass
so you trample in an area okay
12. a sweet drink with bubbles in it a
sweet drink with bubbles in it
you're thinking bubble tea well we think
about soda
the bubbles are a little uh
gas little bubbles of gas of course when
you pour coca-cola
or cider you say cider in korea in
in america we'd say sprite or we would
say a 7up
you have the carbonation the little
bubbles that rise
uh in the drink and that's a street
sweet drink with bubbles in it not
bubble tea
you could say that but in this case
we're talking about soda
three ink that is under the skin
forever so somebody will have uh you
know an artist will
will draw or put this ink under the skin
of a person it's kind of painful to do
and once it's there it's there forever
you can't change it
so later on i don't like it sorry
what are you going to do it's there and
it's very painful to get it to get it
off so be very careful if you do this
but they're calling it a tattoo tattoo
tattoo isn't an english word by the way
it comes from the south pacific
when the english sailors were in that
area and they saw the natives they had
tattoos
and that's what they called it in on
those islands they said tattoo
so the english sailors brought that word
back to england
with them and it became part of the
english language tattoo
very interesting anyway so that's a
tattoo
14 being focused and trying hard to do
something
being focused on something very trying
very hard to do it
it means you are dedicated you are
dedicated
you are focused on your task so you are
very
dedicated in doing your task now
dedicated is an
adjective the noun of course is
dedication
so he has dedication he is
dedicated he has
dedication he is dedicated
okay next one 15. whoa this is very
dangerous right
bull fighting to move suddenly and
powerfully in one direction to move
suddenly
and powerfully in one direction what do
bulls do
bulls charge right they suddenly start
running towards something
and a bull is very powerful it's
charging
so it's not just bulls horses can charge
people can charge teams can charge
a crowd of people can charge just means
moving quickly
and powerfully in one direction
16. to cover with colored liquid of
course there's many
forms or many ways to do this what is
this guy doing
of course he is painting a house but of
course we can also think about
artists like rembrandt or monet
right they are using paint to paint
beautiful pictures
so to cover with colored liquid whether
it's very simple like painting a house
or painting a masterpiece like the mona
lisa right
you're painting is just to paint okay
well that's the words let's take a look
at the
exercises okay the first one here
we need to fill in the blanks for all of
these the first one is our soccer beep
isn't very good we need practice so our
soccer what
when we talk about a group of people who
play soccer they're not very good
we need to practice so our soccer class
our soccer team our soccer fan or our
soccer group if you look at three of
these if you look at
a b and d those are all about a group of
people
c is about one person our soccer fan
isn't very good that sounds strange our
soccer fan is strange
so let's get rid of c we have a b and d
those are all talking about a group of
people but what's the most common way to
describe a group of people
who play sports do we say a soccer class
no a class is for studying do we say a
soccer group
that's close but it's not that common to
say a soccer group it's much more common
to say soccer team and that's the answer
our soccer team
isn't very good we need practice so
team is the best remember a b and d are
all a group of people
but b is the best answer because it's
the most common
way to describe a group of people who
play a sport together
okay number three we're skipping two
that storm was really
what that storm was really beep
it almost knocked that tree over so a
storm that is very strong
it almost knocks a tree is strong but a
storm comes along and tries
almost knocks the tree down what is it
that storm was really brief
intense upset or heavy which one
sounds the best storm was brief that
means very quick
so that's not right the storm was very
intense
intense remember he's very focused
and very strong in some area and
extreme right so if a storm is extreme
or focused on some area it is intense
and it's very strong
the storm was upset that doesn't make
sense because storms don't have feelings
oh that storm looks angry oh that storm
looks happy well that's crazy
okay and heavy we don't say storms are
heavy that's
it's a strange uh relationship we don't
say that we say storms are intense
or fierce or strong or dangerous
but intense is a very good word to use
to describe
a storm okay
number five i know i just ate supper but
i really want
a what so what do you usually eat after
supper
after supper what do you normally eat
you want something
sweet usually what after i eat supper i
want something sweet
after supper so i know i just ate supper
but what do i want
you want what a desert b snack
c fork d breakfast be careful here with
a
desert okay there's two words that are
very similar desert
and the other word is dessert
now be very careful if this word had two
s's it would be correct because that's
common
after dinner i always want to have a
little bit of dessert like something
sweet
piece of cake maybe a cookie some candy
you know
just to have after dinner and that's
very common
to have dessert after dinner but desert
with 1s
is like the sahara desert right
very dry no trees no water so
of course you don't eat the sahara
desert after dinner that's crazy right
so desert be careful desert or dessert
right this is desert not dessert
so it doesn't fit okay
bee snack what is dessert dessert is
like a snack
right so that is an that is the answer
right there
a snack b a fork i really want a fork
that doesn't make sense i want breakfast
after you ate supper no
you have to sleep first next morning
then you have breakfast
the best answer here is snack because i
know i just ate supper i just
ate supper i know that but i really want
a snack
i want something more to eat now usually
after
supper after dinner by the way
americans say dinner and supper are the
same
it's the meal you have in the evening
after that
we usually have dessert dessert is only
after supper we don't have dessert after
lunch you don't have dessert after
breakfast
after breakfast after lunch you have a
snack but you can also have a snack
after dinner after dinner you can have
dessert or you could also call it a
snack it doesn't matter
okay anyway that's kind of complicated
number seven
my dad always beat me in school what
does your dad always do
with you in school does he clean you
in school i hope not the other kids
right strange dad okay then don't do
that
my dad always packs me in school puts
you in a suitcase no that's crazy
my dad always supports me in school
he supports me in school aha that's
interesting or my dad
always brings me in school supports
sounds correct what about brings can we
say my dad always brings me in school
no because we use brings brings you
to school so the correct answer is
support
my dad always supports me in school you
support
someone in something i support him
in his efforts i support him in his
uh field or in his job
but you bring somebody to a place so
support
is the correct answer here okay well
let's
take a break here we'll take a short
break and we'll go into the reading
section next so don't go away

06:10
beyond
06:10
right now that we can explore these
06:12
different areas so in some cases we have
06:15
different
06:15
expressions with further are there any
06:17
further questions
06:19
we have to go a little further okay of
06:21
course we can get confused with
06:23
farther if you say farther a r t h er
06:26
you're only talking about distance
06:28
farther we have much
06:30
farther to go today okay number three
06:34
a person who supports a team or a person
06:37
we talked about that right
06:39
these people who are dressed in
06:40
different colors in their team
06:42
uh these people this is like i said
06:45
before this is
06:45
inside america they're not they're not
06:48
dressed in the national flag of america
06:51
they're dressed in the colors of their
06:53
team probably their college team
06:55
and of course they're called fans of
06:57
course
06:58
that's it right here fan a fan is a
07:00
person who
07:01
is supporting their team now you can
07:03
have a super fan
07:05
super fans most people are normal fans
07:08
right they cheer for their team they go
07:09
out
07:10
but super fans they really go crazy
07:13
okay okay number four a small tasty meal
07:17
so sometimes between breakfast and lunch
07:20
you get hungry
07:21
especially between lunch and dinner you
07:23
might get hungry what do you want
07:25
you want to eat a snack a snack please
07:30
remember that
07:31
snack is countable let's have a snack
07:35
not let's have snack no let's have a
07:38
snack did you have a snack
07:42
uh this afternoon okay what do you want
07:44
to have for
07:45
a snack okay so snack is countable in
07:48
this case
07:49
we say it's like it's but even though if
07:51
you have
07:52
like many pieces of fruit and maybe a
07:54
candy bar
07:55
you call it all a snack so a snack is
07:58
kind of like the entire thing that you
07:59
eat
08:00
during that short time that's a snack
08:03
but usually it's just one thing like a
08:04
candy bar
08:05
or a piece of fruit okay number five
08:09
to help or to hold up now if you help
08:12
somebody or if you're holding something
08:14
up what are you doing
08:15
you are supporting you're supporting
08:17
that this is what fans do
08:20
fans support their teams but you can
08:23
also
08:24
use support in many different ideas
08:27
for example if a house is built on a
08:29
hill you might have
08:31
like pillars supporting the house right
08:33
it just means to hold something up
08:35
so support can be used in different
08:37
ideas in this case though
08:38
we're talking about supporting a team
08:41
right you're showing
08:42
your um your energy or your
08:46
support for that team number six
08:49
very serious and extreme if something's
08:52
very serious
08:53
very extreme we say it is intense
08:56
sometimes of course
08:57
at the international level at the world
09:00
cup level
09:01
soccer players are the best in the world
09:04
their play is very
09:05
intense they're very serious about their
09:08
sport
09:09
and sometimes they do some extreme moves
09:12
right like maybe they kick backwards
09:14
right the goal is behind them they kick
09:16
and the ball goes behind them into the
09:18
gold that is extreme that's very intense
09:22
and of course as fans we like to see
09:24
those intense moments
09:26
that's what makes the game very exciting
09:29
seven having a lot of energy so if
09:31
somebody has a lot of energy
09:33
we say they're energetic that's very
09:35
easy right
09:36
energy is the noun energetic
09:39
is the adjective he has
09:42
a lot of energy he is
09:46
energetic okay so that would be the
09:48
adjective for energy
09:51
eight to quit or to stop
09:54
trying okay if somebody stops trying
09:57
like uh
09:57
they're boxing and somebody falls down
09:59
they can't get up they say i've had
10:01
enough what do they do
10:02
they give up sometimes when kids fight
10:06
they shouldn't fight really but
10:07
sometimes you'll see the kids will hold
10:09
the other kid on the ground say do you
10:10
give up
10:11
or usually brothers when they're
10:13
fighting right one
10:14
one brother say will you give up you
10:16
know stop fighting
10:18
right let's stop fighting do you but
10:20
they want the other person to give up
10:22
or sometimes in a video game you say oh
10:24
it's hopeless i don't want to play to
10:26
the end
10:26
because i know i can't win so i give up
10:29
that means to quit or to stop trying i
10:32
give up or
10:33
do you give up okay number nine
10:37
an entertaining and difficult action
10:40
what is an
10:41
entertaining entertaining and difficult
10:44
action
10:44
we can say a trick a trick is something
10:48
that magicians this is a magic
10:50
trick right we usually think of trick in
10:53
terms of magic
10:55
some famous magicians will do tricks
10:58
that are difficult to do but they're
11:01
very
11:01
entertaining it's also difficult to
11:03
figure out how did he do that
11:05
right and that is a trick number ten
11:10
what the heck is that okay that's not a
11:12
real animal right it's
11:14
an animal a personality that is a symbol
11:17
of a team
11:18
so somebody who's a symbol of a team you
11:20
have different symbols for different
11:22
teams in korea right
11:23
but we call those things mascot a
11:27
mascot so different teams will have
11:29
different
11:30
uh animals or like a person in a funny
11:34
costume
11:34
and they are the mascot so usually it's
11:36
an animal like bears or eagles
11:38
dolphins something like that they will
11:41
be the mascot
11:42
for the team the next one number 11
11:46
is to walk over violently
11:49
of course this is acting right here
11:51
she's walking over this guy
11:53
violently she's trampling this guy
11:56
but usually when you think about this
11:58
word trample
11:59
it's not just one person it's like a
12:02
crowd of people
12:03
many people and maybe they're scared or
12:06
maybe they're excited
12:07
or they're very enthusiastic and they
12:09
don't
12:11
think about safety right they're just
12:13
running as a group
12:14
and sometimes this can be very dangerous
12:16
especially in
12:17
crowded or narrow areas where many
12:20
people are moving
12:21
and somebody falls down other people
12:23
might not even know that person is there
12:25
because there's so many people
12:26
they will trample the person who's on
12:28
the ground so usually this
12:30
is not you know it's usually many people
12:33
walking over
12:34
another person or it doesn't even have
12:36
to be a person you can trample the
12:37
ground
12:38
if there's grass and many people trample
12:40
the grass
12:41
then they walk over the grass maybe they
12:43
ruin the grass
12:44
so you trample in an area okay
12:47
12. a sweet drink with bubbles in it a
12:50
sweet drink with bubbles in it
12:52
you're thinking bubble tea well we think
12:55
about soda
12:56
the bubbles are a little uh
12:59
gas little bubbles of gas of course when
13:02
you pour coca-cola
13:04
or cider you say cider in korea in
13:07
in america we'd say sprite or we would
13:10
say a 7up
13:11
you have the carbonation the little
13:13
bubbles that rise
13:14
uh in the drink and that's a street
13:16
sweet drink with bubbles in it not
13:18
bubble tea
13:19
you could say that but in this case
13:21
we're talking about soda
13:24
three ink that is under the skin
13:27
forever so somebody will have uh you
13:30
know an artist will
13:31
will draw or put this ink under the skin
13:35
of a person it's kind of painful to do
13:37
and once it's there it's there forever
13:40
you can't change it
13:41
so later on i don't like it sorry
13:44
what are you going to do it's there and
13:46
it's very painful to get it to get it
13:48
off so be very careful if you do this
13:50
but they're calling it a tattoo tattoo
13:54
tattoo isn't an english word by the way
13:56
it comes from the south pacific
13:58
when the english sailors were in that
14:00
area and they saw the natives they had
14:02
tattoos
14:03
and that's what they called it in on
14:05
those islands they said tattoo
14:06
so the english sailors brought that word
14:08
back to england
14:10
with them and it became part of the
14:11
english language tattoo
14:13
very interesting anyway so that's a
14:15
tattoo
14:16
14 being focused and trying hard to do
14:20
something
14:21
being focused on something very trying
14:23
very hard to do it
14:25
it means you are dedicated you are
14:27
dedicated
14:28
you are focused on your task so you are
14:31
very
14:32
dedicated in doing your task now
14:34
dedicated is an
14:35
adjective the noun of course is
14:38
dedication
14:40
so he has dedication he is
14:44
dedicated he has
14:47
dedication he is dedicated
14:51
okay next one 15. whoa this is very
14:53
dangerous right
14:55
bull fighting to move suddenly and
14:58
powerfully in one direction to move
15:00
suddenly
15:01
and powerfully in one direction what do
15:04
bulls do
15:05
bulls charge right they suddenly start
15:08
running towards something
15:09
and a bull is very powerful it's
15:12
charging
15:13
so it's not just bulls horses can charge
15:16
people can charge teams can charge
15:20
a crowd of people can charge just means
15:23
moving quickly
15:24
and powerfully in one direction
15:28
16. to cover with colored liquid of
15:31
course there's many
15:32
forms or many ways to do this what is
15:34
this guy doing
15:35
of course he is painting a house but of
15:38
course we can also think about
15:39
artists like rembrandt or monet
15:42
right they are using paint to paint
15:45
beautiful pictures
15:47
so to cover with colored liquid whether
15:49
it's very simple like painting a house
15:51
or painting a masterpiece like the mona
15:53
lisa right
15:55
you're painting is just to paint okay
15:58
well that's the words let's take a look
16:01
at the
16:02
exercises okay the first one here
16:06
we need to fill in the blanks for all of
16:07
these the first one is our soccer beep
16:10
isn't very good we need practice so our
16:13
soccer what
16:14
when we talk about a group of people who
16:16
play soccer they're not very good
16:19
we need to practice so our soccer class
16:22
our soccer team our soccer fan or our
16:25
soccer group if you look at three of
16:28
these if you look at
16:29
a b and d those are all about a group of
16:33
people
16:34
c is about one person our soccer fan
16:38
isn't very good that sounds strange our
16:40
soccer fan is strange
16:42
so let's get rid of c we have a b and d
16:46
those are all talking about a group of
16:48
people but what's the most common way to
16:50
describe a group of people
16:52
who play sports do we say a soccer class
16:55
no a class is for studying do we say a
16:58
soccer group
17:00
that's close but it's not that common to
17:02
say a soccer group it's much more common
17:05
to say soccer team and that's the answer
17:07
our soccer team
17:09
isn't very good we need practice so
17:12
team is the best remember a b and d are
17:15
all a group of people
17:17
but b is the best answer because it's
17:19
the most common
17:20
way to describe a group of people who
17:22
play a sport together
17:24
okay number three we're skipping two
17:27
that storm was really
17:28
what that storm was really beep
17:31
it almost knocked that tree over so a
17:34
storm that is very strong
17:36
it almost knocks a tree is strong but a
17:39
storm comes along and tries
17:40
almost knocks the tree down what is it
17:42
that storm was really brief
17:44
intense upset or heavy which one
17:47
sounds the best storm was brief that
17:50
means very quick
17:50
so that's not right the storm was very
17:53
intense
17:54
intense remember he's very focused
17:58
and very strong in some area and
18:01
extreme right so if a storm is extreme
18:04
or focused on some area it is intense
18:08
and it's very strong
18:09
the storm was upset that doesn't make
18:11
sense because storms don't have feelings
18:14
oh that storm looks angry oh that storm
18:16
looks happy well that's crazy
18:18
okay and heavy we don't say storms are
18:21
heavy that's
18:22
it's a strange uh relationship we don't
18:24
say that we say storms are intense
18:26
or fierce or strong or dangerous
18:30
but intense is a very good word to use
18:32
to describe
18:33
a storm okay
18:37
number five i know i just ate supper but
18:40
i really want
18:41
a what so what do you usually eat after
18:44
supper
18:45
after supper what do you normally eat
18:48
you want something
18:49
sweet usually what after i eat supper i
18:52
want something sweet
18:53
after supper so i know i just ate supper
18:57
but what do i want
18:59
you want what a desert b snack
19:02
c fork d breakfast be careful here with
19:06
a
19:07
desert okay there's two words that are
19:10
very similar desert
19:12
and the other word is dessert
19:17
now be very careful if this word had two
19:20
s's it would be correct because that's
19:23
common
19:24
after dinner i always want to have a
19:26
little bit of dessert like something
19:28
sweet
19:28
piece of cake maybe a cookie some candy
19:31
you know
19:32
just to have after dinner and that's
19:34
very common
19:35
to have dessert after dinner but desert
19:38
with 1s
19:40
is like the sahara desert right
19:43
very dry no trees no water so
19:46
of course you don't eat the sahara
19:48
desert after dinner that's crazy right
19:50
so desert be careful desert or dessert
19:53
right this is desert not dessert
19:56
so it doesn't fit okay
20:00
bee snack what is dessert dessert is
20:02
like a snack
20:04
right so that is an that is the answer
20:06
right there
20:07
a snack b a fork i really want a fork
20:12
that doesn't make sense i want breakfast
20:14
after you ate supper no
20:15
you have to sleep first next morning
20:17
then you have breakfast
20:18
the best answer here is snack because i
20:20
know i just ate supper i just
20:22
ate supper i know that but i really want
20:25
a snack
20:26
i want something more to eat now usually
20:29
after
20:30
supper after dinner by the way
20:34
americans say dinner and supper are the
20:37
same
20:37
it's the meal you have in the evening
20:40
after that
20:41
we usually have dessert dessert is only
20:43
after supper we don't have dessert after
20:45
lunch you don't have dessert after
20:47
breakfast
20:48
after breakfast after lunch you have a
20:50
snack but you can also have a snack
20:52
after dinner after dinner you can have
20:54
dessert or you could also call it a
20:56
snack it doesn't matter
20:57
okay anyway that's kind of complicated
21:00
number seven
21:01
my dad always beat me in school what
21:03
does your dad always do
21:06
with you in school does he clean you
21:09
in school i hope not the other kids
21:13
right strange dad okay then don't do
21:15
that
21:16
my dad always packs me in school puts
21:19
you in a suitcase no that's crazy
21:21
my dad always supports me in school
21:24
he supports me in school aha that's
21:27
interesting or my dad
21:28
always brings me in school supports
21:32
sounds correct what about brings can we
21:34
say my dad always brings me in school
21:36
no because we use brings brings you
21:39
to school so the correct answer is
21:41
support
21:42
my dad always supports me in school you
21:45
support
21:46
someone in something i support him
21:49
in his efforts i support him in his
21:53
uh field or in his job
21:58
but you bring somebody to a place so
22:00
support
22:01
is the correct answer here okay well
22:04
let's
22:04
take a break here we'll take a short
22:06
break and we'll go into the reading
22:07
section next so don't go away
22:18
[Music]
22:24
do
22:28
you
