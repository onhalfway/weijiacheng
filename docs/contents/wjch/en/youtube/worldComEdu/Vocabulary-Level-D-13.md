hello everybody
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
we're on unit 5 we're talking about
cycles not your bicycle but something
that repeats like a circle
like the wheels on your bicycle they go
around
and around and they begin again and
again
so that's what we're talking about with
cycles in lesson 13
we're talking about the world's greatest
traveler now you're probably thinking
the world's greatest traveler
is it marco polo no it's not a person
it's a thing we're going to focus on
the cycle of water and we're going to
see how
water is the world's greatest
traveler because water really travels
a lot and it travels in a cycle it goes
around
and around well we'll explore that idea
later on
in the reading passage but of course as
usual
we need to learn some vocabulary first
to better understand
the reading passage so let's get started
with the vocabulary
the first word is defined as
a series of events that is repeated
a number of times now you've probably
seen
these types of pictures before we can
see a tree
in different stages and we know right
that this is spring
this is summer this is fall and this is
winter
and we might think well seasons but
we're saying
a series of events that is repeated
a number of times it's not just the
seasons
the seasons is an example of this
but what are we talking about we're
talking about a
cycle it's like i talked about before
right on your bicycle
right you have two wheels well think
about one wheel it starts here and it
goes around
and it comes back to the beginning right
it's a
cycle it's a series of events that is
repeated so it goes around right it
starts here
maybe in spring goes round to summer
then to fall then to winter and it comes
back
to spring so the seasons is a type
of cycle and there are many types of
cycles
in the world around us we'll talk about
one in the reading passage
okay word number two water that falls
from the sky so you're probably thinking
about rain right you know this word
rain that's an easy word but there's
another word that we use for rain that's
longer
it's more of a scientific word and i'm
sorry
it's kind of long right pre-st
wow so many syllables there's five
syllables so let's say it fast wolf slow
first and then fast
precipitation precipitation
one more time precipitation
okay so if you say it quickly it sounds
like
precipitation okay precipitation just
means
rain it's more of a scientific word for
rain okay let's move on to number three
the process of water collecting together
in the air
so the process of water collecting
together
in the air now you're probably thinking
what is this it's a cloud
but we're not talking about a cloud
we're not talking about
uh the grouping of moisture in the air
we're talking about the
process of and there's a special word
for that
we call that condensation
oh big words in this lesson right so
let's do this slowly
shun con condensation
faster condensation condensation
okay so condensation is a process
it's the process of water collecting
together
in the air and clouds are
formed because of
condensation so if you think how do
clouds
appear in the sky it's because of
condensation so condensation is the
process
okay let's move on for a liquid to be
taken into the air this is a sad picture
right this little boy he wants to go
swimming
but there's no water in the swimming
pool
what happened to the water in the
swimming pool well
it evaporated right
evaporate is a verb it's also a process
right it's the process of a liquid to be
taken
into the air on a hot day
if you have a dish of water or there's a
puddle of water on the ground well after
some time in the hot day
that water will disappear right in the
summertime you look at the streets
they're very dry
a truck comes by and sprays water on the
streets but after a little while
the water is gone the street is very dry
again
because of evaporation
okay so evaporation makes the water go
into the
air and then when the air is cooled the
air the water gets together
and condensation happens okay so first
evaporation then condensation we'll talk
about those later
but we need to know about those words
okay next one
five to suck up or drink in to suck up
or drink
in is to absorb
absorb okay we're doing some a little
bit difficult less
words in this lesson right now of course
if you spill
something you can use a paper towel
to absorb the liquid
that you spilled on the table okay
so you can use a paper towel and paper
towels
the companies that make paper towels
will boast they will brag they'll say
our paper towels have
great absorption power right they will
absorb
a lot of liquid to take in or to
to suck up or to drink in or to take in
okay oh he's happy to become aware
to become aware of something is to
realize it looks like he had oh i have
an idea right it's like bing a light
bulb
goes on over his head he realizes
something he became aware of something a
lot of famous inventors are scientists
you know there's stories about them you
know uh
coming to a moment of realization right
like the famous
uh greek uh philosopher who sat
in a bathtub and said oh eureka right
and realized
he could use uh the water the weight of
an object in a water to realize
how much volume it had okay so to
realize
it's like the moment you understand
something
next one for a liquid to move together
in a single direction
for a liquid any liquid to move together
and
a lot of liquid moving togetherness in
one direction it doesn't have to be a
lot it could be a cup of water
but if you spill it it moves in a
direction
this stream of course is moving in a
direction downhill
what is it doing it is flowing flow
is a verb to flow so
this small stream is flowing
quickly right because maybe it's a it's
kind of a
not very steep but it's it's a it's not
flat
it's uh you know there's uphill and then
downhill and the water will flow
quickly downhill so this is a very
active
stream right okay next one
greatly needed or necessary greatly
needed or necessary is essential
if something is essential you really
need it
you for example we think of when we
think of essential
it's like things that we need to
continue to survive like
food food is essential air
oxygen is essential if we don't have it
we'll die
right so we greatly need it it's very
necessary
it's essential okay next one nine
whoa looks like uh he's on vacation
at a resort a large cloth
used for drying so what do we call this
cloth you probably
take it to the beach with you or you
take it when you go swimming
you use it when you take a shower or a
bath
it's called a towel a towel
so if you're in an english-speaking
country
and you want a cloth to dry yourself off
you can ask is there a towel please or
can i get a towel okay next one
a flow of water used to clean oneself i
just mentioned this word after you do
this you need a towel
remember what i said i said when you
take a shower
when we use the word shower we use it in
a larger expression
very commonly take a
take a shower we also use take
a bath okay now what's the difference
between a shower and a bath well you see
this boy here
the water is falling from the faucet
above it's falling on him like rain
that's a shower
but a bath is where you have a bathtub
and you sit
in the water right and the water's
already there and you you clean yourself
with the bath water
it's kind of like when you go to a sauna
right it's kind of like a big
bath right and you get the sauna but a
shower
is like this style so but we use take up
take a shower take a bath okay
you should take a shower every day you
should take a shower
after you exercise remember to do that
right
if you don't take a shower oh some nim
say sale right
okay next one 11 a collection of water
high up in the sky
we talked about this before right i gave
you the word before
it's a cloud right so this airplane is
flying over these clouds it's very
beautiful
if you're ever in an airplane very high
up in the sky
look out the window and you can see the
the clouds below you
it looks like land but it's very
fantastic right
very beautiful very white and looks very
clean
okay next one not moving
so this lake the water in this lake
is what it is very still still
we can also say calm
still or calm calm means there's no
emotion
right this is very peaceful calm
the water is still no movement
okay that's a very beautiful picture
next one a very tiny bit of water so a
very
tiny bit of water we what do we call
that we call it a droplet
a droplet it's like a little ball of
water right when we
when we just drop a little bit of water
on something or when it rains just
lightly
not a lot but the water will collect in
little drops
in drops and we call them droplets
there's one
droplet two droplets you could also of
course just say
a drop of water but sometimes people
will say
droplet okay next one a small pool of
water is a puddle
so you like to go splashing through the
puddles right okay
this girl of course she's wearing good
shoes for that don't do that if you're
wearing shoes and socks your mother will
be angry right
but if you're wearing sandals or or
rubber shoes like she's wearing no
problem have
fun right go running through the puddles
of water
kids like to do that okay next one
icy rain it's rain but it's
really cold so it becomes icy
it's almost freezing we call that sleet
so sleet is you know it's not snow it's
not
rain but it's like almost
a combination of both it's where it's
really cold and it's raining
and it's it's almost icy right so it's
icy rain it's sleet
now sleet is dangerous because on the
roads we have to be very careful
because as you know ice is
right it's slippery right so you have to
be careful
when it's sleet outside you also have to
be careful when you're walking
okay next one for a liquid to absorb
into something when a liquid absorb we
heard this word before right
we talked about the paper towel right
the paper towel
will clean up the liquid it will absorb
into the paper towel
we say it's soaked right
if you are soaked right it's raining
really hard like in the summertime
you go outside and you don't have an
umbrella you don't have a raincoat
you're just wearing normal clothes what
happens
you get water everywhere in your hair on
your shirt
under your shirt on your underwear is
completely wet
your socks in your shoes
when you're walking right it makes a
noise you
are soaked right so people will say
i am soaked
it means i got water everywhere
right i have to take everything off take
a hot shower
and then dry off because i'm soaked
okay so to soak is for liquid to
completely
absorb into something it doesn't matter
what it is
it could be you your skin right it could
be a paper towel
it could be a dog you know whatever the
water has completely
gotten in and onto something that's to
soak
okay next one well not next one we need
to look at the words
let's check the words that we just
learned make sure that we remember those
and how they are used so let's go over
the different problems here
number one i just beep that i forgot to
do my homework
so you just what
it's like you have an idea and what is
that
i just a made be realized
c spent d absorbed
so in this case right we could use
a word that means that you had a sudden
idea you suddenly became aware
of the fact that you forgot to do your
homework has that ever happened to you
it's not a good feeling oh my gosh right
it's at the beginning of the lesson the
beginning of the class
and you're suddenly realized oh my gosh
there was homework yesterday
the teacher gave us homework and i
forgot
suddenly you have that idea that means
you
realized i just realized oh i just
thought i just remembered
i just realized that i forgot to do my
homework
not made not spent not absorbed those
don't make sense
realized you suddenly became aware of
that fact
okay number four birth and death
are part of the beep of life think about
that
birth is at the beginning right a person
lives their life
right and then they die now of course
for an individual person for one person
it's not a continual process
but if that person is born they grow up
they have a baby
right that person is born and they grow
so it's like it goes around in a circle
right so what do we call that birth and
death are part of the what of life
end beginning c cycle d
loss remember we have a beginning and
then an
end and then it starts again right well
life continues
right not for the individual person
unfortunately
right uh it's like a straight line birth
and then death
but if we're talking about all things
like human beings right
people are born they die more people are
born
they die it goes around in a continual
process
so we call that what we call it a cycle
that's what i talked about before
right birth and death are part of the
cycle of
life okay if you watch the lion king
maybe an older movie maybe you haven't
seen it but at the beginning they talk
about the circle
of life that's the same idea it's the
cycle
of life they're talking about constant
death and constant
renewal constant death and constant
birth it goes in a cycle
the circle of life there's a song
associated with that
okay but it's not the end of life
because birth continues
it's not the beginning because that's
only one part and it's not the loss of
life
it's the cycle it goes again and again
okay next one number five when there is
enough water
in the sky it will beep to form clouds
now remember before i talked about this
how
are clouds formed what is the process
for forming clouds why are clouds formed
because it precipitates because it rains
no
because it flows right it will flow to
form
uh clouds water will flow in the sky
that's weird that doesn't make sense
it will realize water can't think right
it will condense ah condense
to form clouds condensation
is the reason that clouds are formed if
there's enough
water in the sky that water will gather
together
and form clouds and we call that the
process we call it
to condense right and we call it
condensation
okay seven here this tissue will beep
the blood so if you're bleeding oh no
you have to absorb the blood right i
just gave you the answer
right this tissue will absorb the blood
you need to
not drink it in but you need to soak it
in you need to stop that blood so you
use
a tissue or maybe a bandage to stop
the blood it will absorb the blood and
then stop the bleeding
absorb not flow not cut not pinch
but to absorb the blood okay well that
wraps up the vocabulary section of our
lesson today
let's take a short break come back and
we'll do the reading together so don't
go away

00:08
hello everybody
00:09
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
00:12
we're on unit 5 we're talking about
00:16
cycles not your bicycle but something
00:19
that repeats like a circle
00:20
like the wheels on your bicycle they go
00:23
around
00:24
and around and they begin again and
00:27
again
00:28
so that's what we're talking about with
00:30
cycles in lesson 13
00:33
we're talking about the world's greatest
00:36
traveler now you're probably thinking
00:38
the world's greatest traveler
00:40
is it marco polo no it's not a person
00:44
it's a thing we're going to focus on
00:47
the cycle of water and we're going to
00:50
see how
00:51
water is the world's greatest
00:54
traveler because water really travels
00:58
a lot and it travels in a cycle it goes
01:01
around
01:02
and around well we'll explore that idea
01:05
later on
01:06
in the reading passage but of course as
01:08
usual
01:09
we need to learn some vocabulary first
01:12
to better understand
01:13
the reading passage so let's get started
01:16
with the vocabulary
01:18
the first word is defined as
01:22
a series of events that is repeated
01:25
a number of times now you've probably
01:28
seen
01:29
these types of pictures before we can
01:31
see a tree
01:33
in different stages and we know right
01:36
that this is spring
01:38
this is summer this is fall and this is
01:41
winter
01:42
and we might think well seasons but
01:45
we're saying
01:45
a series of events that is repeated
01:49
a number of times it's not just the
01:52
seasons
01:53
the seasons is an example of this
01:56
but what are we talking about we're
01:58
talking about a
01:59
cycle it's like i talked about before
02:01
right on your bicycle
02:03
right you have two wheels well think
02:05
about one wheel it starts here and it
02:08
goes around
02:09
and it comes back to the beginning right
02:11
it's a
02:12
cycle it's a series of events that is
02:15
repeated so it goes around right it
02:17
starts here
02:18
maybe in spring goes round to summer
02:23
then to fall then to winter and it comes
02:26
back
02:26
to spring so the seasons is a type
02:29
of cycle and there are many types of
02:32
cycles
02:33
in the world around us we'll talk about
02:36
one in the reading passage
02:38
okay word number two water that falls
02:42
from the sky so you're probably thinking
02:45
about rain right you know this word
02:47
rain that's an easy word but there's
02:51
another word that we use for rain that's
02:54
longer
02:54
it's more of a scientific word and i'm
02:57
sorry
02:58
it's kind of long right pre-st
03:09
wow so many syllables there's five
03:12
syllables so let's say it fast wolf slow
03:15
first and then fast
03:16
precipitation precipitation
03:21
one more time precipitation
03:24
okay so if you say it quickly it sounds
03:26
like
03:27
precipitation okay precipitation just
03:31
means
03:31
rain it's more of a scientific word for
03:34
rain okay let's move on to number three
03:38
the process of water collecting together
03:41
in the air
03:42
so the process of water collecting
03:45
together
03:46
in the air now you're probably thinking
03:48
what is this it's a cloud
03:50
but we're not talking about a cloud
03:52
we're not talking about
03:54
uh the grouping of moisture in the air
03:57
we're talking about the
03:58
process of and there's a special word
04:00
for that
04:01
we call that condensation
04:04
oh big words in this lesson right so
04:07
let's do this slowly
04:11
shun con condensation
04:14
faster condensation condensation
04:18
okay so condensation is a process
04:22
it's the process of water collecting
04:25
together
04:25
in the air and clouds are
04:28
formed because of
04:32
condensation so if you think how do
04:34
clouds
04:35
appear in the sky it's because of
04:39
condensation so condensation is the
04:41
process
04:42
okay let's move on for a liquid to be
04:46
taken into the air this is a sad picture
04:49
right this little boy he wants to go
04:50
swimming
04:51
but there's no water in the swimming
04:53
pool
04:54
what happened to the water in the
04:57
swimming pool well
04:58
it evaporated right
05:02
evaporate is a verb it's also a process
05:05
right it's the process of a liquid to be
05:08
taken
05:09
into the air on a hot day
05:12
if you have a dish of water or there's a
05:16
puddle of water on the ground well after
05:19
some time in the hot day
05:21
that water will disappear right in the
05:24
summertime you look at the streets
05:25
they're very dry
05:27
a truck comes by and sprays water on the
05:30
streets but after a little while
05:32
the water is gone the street is very dry
05:35
again
05:36
because of evaporation
05:39
okay so evaporation makes the water go
05:42
into the
05:43
air and then when the air is cooled the
05:45
air the water gets together
05:47
and condensation happens okay so first
05:51
evaporation then condensation we'll talk
05:53
about those later
05:54
but we need to know about those words
05:56
okay next one
05:59
five to suck up or drink in to suck up
06:03
or drink
06:03
in is to absorb
06:07
absorb okay we're doing some a little
06:10
bit difficult less
06:11
words in this lesson right now of course
06:13
if you spill
06:14
something you can use a paper towel
06:17
to absorb the liquid
06:21
that you spilled on the table okay
06:24
so you can use a paper towel and paper
06:27
towels
06:28
the companies that make paper towels
06:31
will boast they will brag they'll say
06:34
our paper towels have
06:35
great absorption power right they will
06:39
absorb
06:40
a lot of liquid to take in or to
06:43
to suck up or to drink in or to take in
06:47
okay oh he's happy to become aware
06:50
to become aware of something is to
06:54
realize it looks like he had oh i have
06:56
an idea right it's like bing a light
06:58
bulb
06:59
goes on over his head he realizes
07:03
something he became aware of something a
07:06
lot of famous inventors are scientists
07:08
you know there's stories about them you
07:10
know uh
07:12
coming to a moment of realization right
07:14
like the famous
07:15
uh greek uh philosopher who sat
07:18
in a bathtub and said oh eureka right
07:21
and realized
07:22
he could use uh the water the weight of
07:25
an object in a water to realize
07:26
how much volume it had okay so to
07:30
realize
07:30
it's like the moment you understand
07:33
something
07:35
next one for a liquid to move together
07:38
in a single direction
07:40
for a liquid any liquid to move together
07:42
and
07:43
a lot of liquid moving togetherness in
07:45
one direction it doesn't have to be a
07:47
lot it could be a cup of water
07:48
but if you spill it it moves in a
07:51
direction
07:52
this stream of course is moving in a
07:54
direction downhill
07:55
what is it doing it is flowing flow
07:59
is a verb to flow so
08:02
this small stream is flowing
08:07
quickly right because maybe it's a it's
08:09
kind of a
08:11
not very steep but it's it's a it's not
08:13
flat
08:14
it's uh you know there's uphill and then
08:16
downhill and the water will flow
08:18
quickly downhill so this is a very
08:21
active
08:22
stream right okay next one
08:25
greatly needed or necessary greatly
08:28
needed or necessary is essential
08:32
if something is essential you really
08:35
need it
08:36
you for example we think of when we
08:39
think of essential
08:40
it's like things that we need to
08:43
continue to survive like
08:44
food food is essential air
08:48
oxygen is essential if we don't have it
08:51
we'll die
08:52
right so we greatly need it it's very
08:54
necessary
08:55
it's essential okay next one nine
08:59
whoa looks like uh he's on vacation
09:03
at a resort a large cloth
09:06
used for drying so what do we call this
09:09
cloth you probably
09:10
take it to the beach with you or you
09:12
take it when you go swimming
09:14
you use it when you take a shower or a
09:16
bath
09:17
it's called a towel a towel
09:20
so if you're in an english-speaking
09:23
country
09:24
and you want a cloth to dry yourself off
09:27
you can ask is there a towel please or
09:31
can i get a towel okay next one
09:35
a flow of water used to clean oneself i
09:38
just mentioned this word after you do
09:41
this you need a towel
09:42
remember what i said i said when you
09:45
take a shower
09:46
when we use the word shower we use it in
09:49
a larger expression
09:51
very commonly take a
09:54
take a shower we also use take
09:57
a bath okay now what's the difference
10:01
between a shower and a bath well you see
10:04
this boy here
10:05
the water is falling from the faucet
10:09
above it's falling on him like rain
10:12
that's a shower
10:13
but a bath is where you have a bathtub
10:16
and you sit
10:17
in the water right and the water's
10:19
already there and you you clean yourself
10:21
with the bath water
10:22
it's kind of like when you go to a sauna
10:24
right it's kind of like a big
10:25
bath right and you get the sauna but a
10:28
shower
10:29
is like this style so but we use take up
10:32
take a shower take a bath okay
10:35
you should take a shower every day you
10:38
should take a shower
10:39
after you exercise remember to do that
10:42
right
10:42
if you don't take a shower oh some nim
10:45
say sale right
10:46
okay next one 11 a collection of water
10:50
high up in the sky
10:51
we talked about this before right i gave
10:54
you the word before
10:55
it's a cloud right so this airplane is
10:58
flying over these clouds it's very
11:02
beautiful
11:03
if you're ever in an airplane very high
11:05
up in the sky
11:06
look out the window and you can see the
11:09
the clouds below you
11:11
it looks like land but it's very
11:13
fantastic right
11:14
very beautiful very white and looks very
11:17
clean
11:18
okay next one not moving
11:22
so this lake the water in this lake
11:26
is what it is very still still
11:29
we can also say calm
11:33
still or calm calm means there's no
11:37
emotion
11:37
right this is very peaceful calm
11:41
the water is still no movement
11:45
okay that's a very beautiful picture
11:48
next one a very tiny bit of water so a
11:50
very
11:51
tiny bit of water we what do we call
11:53
that we call it a droplet
11:56
a droplet it's like a little ball of
11:58
water right when we
12:00
when we just drop a little bit of water
12:02
on something or when it rains just
12:04
lightly
12:05
not a lot but the water will collect in
12:07
little drops
12:09
in drops and we call them droplets
12:12
there's one
12:13
droplet two droplets you could also of
12:15
course just say
12:16
a drop of water but sometimes people
12:19
will say
12:20
droplet okay next one a small pool of
12:24
water is a puddle
12:26
so you like to go splashing through the
12:28
puddles right okay
12:30
this girl of course she's wearing good
12:31
shoes for that don't do that if you're
12:33
wearing shoes and socks your mother will
12:35
be angry right
12:36
but if you're wearing sandals or or
12:39
rubber shoes like she's wearing no
12:41
problem have
12:42
fun right go running through the puddles
12:44
of water
12:45
kids like to do that okay next one
12:48
icy rain it's rain but it's
12:52
really cold so it becomes icy
12:55
it's almost freezing we call that sleet
12:59
so sleet is you know it's not snow it's
13:02
not
13:03
rain but it's like almost
13:06
a combination of both it's where it's
13:09
really cold and it's raining
13:10
and it's it's almost icy right so it's
13:14
icy rain it's sleet
13:15
now sleet is dangerous because on the
13:18
roads we have to be very careful
13:20
because as you know ice is
13:23
right it's slippery right so you have to
13:26
be careful
13:27
when it's sleet outside you also have to
13:29
be careful when you're walking
13:31
okay next one for a liquid to absorb
13:35
into something when a liquid absorb we
13:38
heard this word before right
13:39
we talked about the paper towel right
13:41
the paper towel
13:43
will clean up the liquid it will absorb
13:45
into the paper towel
13:47
we say it's soaked right
13:50
if you are soaked right it's raining
13:53
really hard like in the summertime
13:55
you go outside and you don't have an
13:57
umbrella you don't have a raincoat
14:00
you're just wearing normal clothes what
14:02
happens
14:03
you get water everywhere in your hair on
14:06
your shirt
14:07
under your shirt on your underwear is
14:09
completely wet
14:10
your socks in your shoes
14:14
when you're walking right it makes a
14:16
noise you
14:17
are soaked right so people will say
14:20
i am soaked
14:24
it means i got water everywhere
14:27
right i have to take everything off take
14:30
a hot shower
14:31
and then dry off because i'm soaked
14:34
okay so to soak is for liquid to
14:36
completely
14:37
absorb into something it doesn't matter
14:39
what it is
14:40
it could be you your skin right it could
14:43
be a paper towel
14:44
it could be a dog you know whatever the
14:47
water has completely
14:49
gotten in and onto something that's to
14:52
soak
14:53
okay next one well not next one we need
14:56
to look at the words
14:57
let's check the words that we just
14:59
learned make sure that we remember those
15:01
and how they are used so let's go over
15:03
the different problems here
15:05
number one i just beep that i forgot to
15:08
do my homework
15:09
so you just what
15:12
it's like you have an idea and what is
15:16
that
15:16
i just a made be realized
15:19
c spent d absorbed
15:23
so in this case right we could use
15:27
a word that means that you had a sudden
15:30
idea you suddenly became aware
15:34
of the fact that you forgot to do your
15:37
homework has that ever happened to you
15:39
it's not a good feeling oh my gosh right
15:42
it's at the beginning of the lesson the
15:44
beginning of the class
15:46
and you're suddenly realized oh my gosh
15:48
there was homework yesterday
15:49
the teacher gave us homework and i
15:51
forgot
15:52
suddenly you have that idea that means
15:55
you
15:56
realized i just realized oh i just
15:59
thought i just remembered
16:01
i just realized that i forgot to do my
16:04
homework
16:04
not made not spent not absorbed those
16:07
don't make sense
16:08
realized you suddenly became aware of
16:11
that fact
16:12
okay number four birth and death
16:15
are part of the beep of life think about
16:18
that
16:19
birth is at the beginning right a person
16:22
lives their life
16:23
right and then they die now of course
16:26
for an individual person for one person
16:29
it's not a continual process
16:32
but if that person is born they grow up
16:35
they have a baby
16:36
right that person is born and they grow
16:38
so it's like it goes around in a circle
16:41
right so what do we call that birth and
16:43
death are part of the what of life
16:45
end beginning c cycle d
16:48
loss remember we have a beginning and
16:51
then an
16:52
end and then it starts again right well
16:54
life continues
16:55
right not for the individual person
16:58
unfortunately
16:59
right uh it's like a straight line birth
17:02
and then death
17:03
but if we're talking about all things
17:05
like human beings right
17:06
people are born they die more people are
17:09
born
17:10
they die it goes around in a continual
17:12
process
17:13
so we call that what we call it a cycle
17:16
that's what i talked about before
17:18
right birth and death are part of the
17:20
cycle of
17:21
life okay if you watch the lion king
17:24
maybe an older movie maybe you haven't
17:26
seen it but at the beginning they talk
17:28
about the circle
17:29
of life that's the same idea it's the
17:32
cycle
17:32
of life they're talking about constant
17:34
death and constant
17:36
renewal constant death and constant
17:38
birth it goes in a cycle
17:40
the circle of life there's a song
17:43
associated with that
17:44
okay but it's not the end of life
17:46
because birth continues
17:48
it's not the beginning because that's
17:49
only one part and it's not the loss of
17:52
life
17:52
it's the cycle it goes again and again
17:56
okay next one number five when there is
17:59
enough water
18:00
in the sky it will beep to form clouds
18:03
now remember before i talked about this
18:06
how
18:07
are clouds formed what is the process
18:11
for forming clouds why are clouds formed
18:14
because it precipitates because it rains
18:17
no
18:17
because it flows right it will flow to
18:21
form
18:22
uh clouds water will flow in the sky
18:24
that's weird that doesn't make sense
18:26
it will realize water can't think right
18:30
it will condense ah condense
18:33
to form clouds condensation
18:37
is the reason that clouds are formed if
18:39
there's enough
18:40
water in the sky that water will gather
18:42
together
18:43
and form clouds and we call that the
18:46
process we call it
18:47
to condense right and we call it
18:50
condensation
18:51
okay seven here this tissue will beep
18:54
the blood so if you're bleeding oh no
18:57
you have to absorb the blood right i
19:00
just gave you the answer
19:01
right this tissue will absorb the blood
19:03
you need to
19:05
not drink it in but you need to soak it
19:08
in you need to stop that blood so you
19:09
use
19:10
a tissue or maybe a bandage to stop
19:13
the blood it will absorb the blood and
19:15
then stop the bleeding
19:17
absorb not flow not cut not pinch
19:20
but to absorb the blood okay well that
19:23
wraps up the vocabulary section of our
19:25
lesson today
19:26
let's take a short break come back and
19:28
we'll do the reading together so don't
19:29
go away
19:48
[Music]
19:49
