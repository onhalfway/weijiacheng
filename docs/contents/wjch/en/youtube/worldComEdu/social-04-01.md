hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading my name is brian and we're going
over
social book 4 lesson one
in this video lesson and lesson one is
about
different cultures different cultures
talk about
how people from different countries
different
areas of the world how do they live what
do they
eat what kind of clothes do they wear
what kind of ideas do they have
these are all different cultures so in
this unit
we will discover what people from
different countries wear
and how countries can share their
cultures so let's get into it
as usual we start with the vocabulary
the first
word in our vocabulary list is tradition
tradition is very important to cultures
because tradition means
the customs or beliefs which are handed
down
from people before you so traditions
of course come from a very long
history and traditions are passed down
from mother to
daughter father to son and then from
grandfather to grandchildren grandmother
to grandchildren
and these traditions are passed down in
stories
in the way people act in what they say
and basically how they live so
traditions
kind of think about traditions as being
i want to say old-fashioned but of
course they are very
rooted in history and the way that
previous
generations did things they will hand
their their traditions
down to their children and so on so
those are traditions
okay next word ancestor i just mentioned
this word
ancestor ancestor is a person in your
family
who lived a long time ago
yeah usually we talk about ancestors as
people who live you know your great
grandfather your great great grandfather
but your grandfather
and your grandmother and also just your
parents are also your ancestors and
they're still with us
good so a person in your family who
lived a long time ago
yeah but also people who are living now
are also your ancestors
right but usually when we talk about
ancestors we're talking about
the generations that came before you
so you can think about where did my
ancestors live how did my ancestors how
did my ancestors live
usually when we ask these questions
we're talking about you know hundreds of
years ago how did people
live or where did they come from
especially if you're from a country that
has many
immigrants many people who moved to that
country like america
where many people came from other
countries so you could say where did my
ancestors come from
okay next we have
legend a legend is a story that is
handed down
as part of tradition traditions really
when you think about it they
are stories most of traditions are just
stories or they're built
on stories and stories that become that
are repeated again and again and they
become
part of a culture and usually they're
maybe they have some basis in fact or
real history
but of course they are very uh legends
are kind of like
their the the story grows and it becomes
more and more
fantastic or more and more impressive
over time
as each retelling comes about so
legends are stories that are very old
they come down from
many generations ago and of course when
you think about legends you can think
about in the west the greek legends
about the greek heroes like hercules and
and perseus right
these are very amazing stories and
sometimes of course they're a little
fantastical
but they're part of a culture and there
are
there are stories also that give reasons
for why people do certain things
so they could be legends also another
word that's very similar to legend
is myth so myths
and legends are very important to a
culture
okay next we have diversity
or diversity diversity is the quality
of being different so if you have a
group of people like this group of
young people right here you can see that
they're they're not all the same
right they're different right there's
boys there's girls
there's different races there could even
be different
i'm not sure because they're lying down
but they can be different heights right
so diversity just means the quality of
being different
people in a group who are not all the
same or who all look the same
or who all have the same beliefs or
ideas
or ways of living but they have diverse
if there are different people in the
group who look different
who think differently who live
differently
then that is a diverse group instead of
a uniform
uniform would be the opposite of
diversity
uniform so you could have a uniform
society or you can have a diverse
society society
okay but diversity just means the
quality of being
different next we have connect
connect means to join or link together
there's a famous
idea about this the six degrees of kevin
bacon
that kevin bacon is a famous actor and
there's an idea that
everybody knows somebody you know
somebody who
is only six who knows maybe less than
six people
who personally knows kevin bacon a
famous actor so
that's kind of like this picture here
you know who do you know you know
how close are you how are you connected
to other people
your friends who are their friends who
are their relatives
how are all those connections made so to
connect is to
join or link together how are you
connected
to the people in your neighborhood in
your city
in your country in the world right what
are those connections okay
okay the next word is take part in
this is a three part verb right
to take part in also we call it a
phrasal verb but it also means
just to participate part
two participate
is a hymduro or difficult word right
participate
right partis pay four syllables take
part in is easier to say it's but it's
three words right
take part in so to take part in means to
join a group that is doing
something together so if you see a
soccer game and you want to join the
soccer game
you take part in the soccer game or you
participate in the soccer game
if you see a group of people eating
lunch together you say oh
i want to eat lunch with them so you
when you join them
you take part in that group eating lunch
you participate in their lunch okay but
take part in means to join a group
that is doing something together
next we have chopsticks chopsticks are
eating utensils you utensils you
ten souls utensils in the west
are a knife fork and spoon in
many asian countries they are chopsticks
and they are just a pair of sticks
small sticks you know only about that
long which people use to eat
food of course if you're watching me
from an asian country you're very
familiar with chopsticks
uh if you're not then of course
chopsticks are
very commonly used in many asian
countries to
eat food especially chinese food and you
know a lot of americans
do know what chopsticks are and they do
use them because chinese food
is very popular in america there's many
chinese restaurants
and of course you can ask for chopsticks
to eat your food at the chinese
restaurant okay okay our last word is
meal meal of course is a dish
of food that you eat during the day
usually we have
three meals a day unless of course
you're a hobbit
okay it's from the lord of the rings
they have breakfast and second breakfast
and
and so on throughout the day but you
should only eat three meals a day
some people only eat two meals a day
because they want to lose
weight but traditionally the three meals
a day
are breakfast in the morning lunch
in the middle of the day and dinner in
the
evening it looks like this young
gentleman
is eating spaghetti probably
dinner okay that's a lot of spaghetti
okay so anyway that's a meal and those
are our words for the lesson
okay we have the first idea from this
lesson we have different
traditions now remember traditions are
practices beliefs things that are done
by
ancestors and passed down to their
descendants or their children
so what are some different traditions of
course if you look at different
countries
around the world you'll see that people
will do everyday
life things they'll do them differently
and those are
different traditions different cultures
so the first one we have japanese people
japanese people
wear their traditional clothes called
a kimono
okay so kimono is
traditional japanese clothing and of
course
many different countries will have like
their traditional
dress or their traditional clothing
in japan they use a kimono or they will
wear a kimono
in korea korean people wear their
traditional clothes
called a hanbok hanbok right
and those are very colorful and as we
can see this
this woman is wearing it it's very
colorful lots of bright colors
okay and there it's very when you see
these
uh clothes these types of clothes or
their suits
of clothing you could say you when you
see these types of dress
although don't get confused between a
woman's
dress and when we say the traditional
dress they're different right it's not a
dress it could be something different
but when we see these we can immediately
associate oh
they're from this country if you see a
scotsman
wearing a kilt you know a scottish
person right
see a person wearing a handbook saying
oh from korea
okay so weak clothes can ease are easily
distinguishable
between cultures now in the third um
box we have people in the u.s who came
from
all over the world have various
traditions so they're not talking about
dress
or costume traditional costume national
costume here
and in fact it you can't really say that
there's a national
um dress or traditional clothes for the
united states
because people come from all over the
world
and there's no real traditional what is
the traditional
uh costume or clothing for an american
you might some people might be make a
joke and say oh t-shirt and shorts
okay maybe but a lot of people do wear
those
but you know people from america from
all sorts of different cultures all
sorts of different traditions
and so there are many different types of
dress i gave you the example of scottish
there are a lot of scottish americans
and when they get together and they
celebrate their scottish heritage
tradition custom they many of them will
wear scottish
uh clothing i almost said dress
be careful traditional clothing and the
same thing for other groups as well
germans
italians mexicans all sorts of different
ethnicities and different groups okay
so those are all different traditions
next we have sharing cultures now it's
very interesting to go around the world
and to look at how other people live
because it's really you can expand your
mind and you can gain a lot of knowledge
about different ways to live so let's
take a look
at examples from different cultures
around the world and see
how they can be shared for example
origami you've probably heard of origami
origami is japan's
paper folding tradition and it's a
tradition
and it's spread throughout the world we
see it people in many different
countries
have adopted so you can adopt
a tradition or adopt part of a tradition
you can adopt a tradition
and you can do it yourself so origami is
a very
uh popular hobby all over the world that
started in japan
but it's making little animals out of
paper
and we can even see it in movies right
there's a famous movie blade runner and
one of the characters
was doing this so you know origami is
really spread worldwide
next we have music music is a very
important part of culture as well
besides stories and food and clothing
in mexico mariachi mariachi i hope i
pronounced that right mariachi
is the traditional music of mexico
and you can hear mariachi singers or
mariachi bands
it might be a little bit common
uh to think of that if you go to a
mexican restaurant especially in the
southwest of america
there might be little mariachi bands a
group of usually three musicians
who come and they'll sing mexican songs
at your table in
the restaurant and we can also see that
in tv and movies as well
so that's the traditional music of
mexico
next we have a tradition coming from
ghana ghana is a country in africa
and we have a legend so again legends
are old stories you know about
uh you may be talking animals or heroes
that do
fantastic deeds well
from ghana is this legend called a nancy
the spider
a nancy when i first asked how do you
pronounce that i looked it up it sounds
like
a nancy like a jane but no it's
don't say ah nancy just say a nancy a
nancy the spider
is a legend from ghana and it's a story
about a spider
these types of stories that are very old
are passed down from generation to
generation
and they're in many cases they're
entertaining but
in many cases also they have a story
or a moral a lesson behind the story
that kind of reinforces the beliefs of a
certain group of people
okay so those are our two ideas from the
lesson now let's take a look at the
reading
okay now it's time for the reading so
let's take a look we're looking at
different cultures
in this lesson of course so we're
talking about different traditions and
we'll be looking at different traditions
in the reading passage
as i read as usual try to read along
with me
practice the pronunciation of these
words
if it's not practical if it's not a good
idea to read out loud you might be
disturbing somebody around you or read
along in your mind
and focus on the vocabulary of course
and try to pick up
any new words are you guys ready let's
begin
different people and cultures have
different traditions for example
in japan people wear traditional clothes
called a kimono
okay on the other hand korean people
wear a hanbak
sometimes different cultures have
similar traditions in both
japan and korea people use
chopsticks to eat their meals
traditions come from ancestors
who lived a long time ago
interestingly every culture
has its own stories
legends are interesting stories
which also come from long
ago there
is a lot of diversity in the united
states
because people there came from all
over the world sharing customs
and traditions is a way that american
citizens
can connect with each other
taking part in learning about other
people's traditions
is a way to make their community an
interesting place it is also
a good way to help americans get along
with each other so this is a very good
lesson actually for living in a
multi-cultural
society a multi-cultural society
it's important to learn about each
other's cultures
it's interesting and it helps people get
along
okay this reading passage is organized
by
main idea and then details that support
that main idea what is the main idea
the main idea is that different people
and cultures
have different beep so what
word did we talk about in the vocabulary
that means the beliefs the practices the
way that people
think and talk about themselves they are
different
traditions okay
so different people and cultures have
different
traditions s because there's more than
one tradition
tradition there's a japanese tradition
there's korean tradition
they there's countdowns traditions
okay good so an example what's an
example of that so now we need some
details to support that
idea an example is um in japan
people wear traditional clothes called a
or
an they're trying to trick you there but
of course we use a
because it's a kimono a kimono
so akimo no a kimono
okay so people wear traditional clothes
called
a kimono in korea people wear
a or an of course it's a because it's
hanbak
right so
okay good so different styles of
clothing
okay now those are different things
right um
they're different styles but there's
also a detail
it's interesting because the detail
doesn't really support the main idea but
it's
you know it was in the passage that you
know sir people have different
traditions
and they may have different ways of
doing something but in some ways they're
also similar
so in both japan and korea people use
beep to eat their meals what do they use
i have one part right i need another
part
people use chopsticks chop sticks
chop sticks
a little hard to write with his pen
people use chopsticks
to eat their meals so yeah that is
different because not everybody does it
outside of asia in europe they don't use
chopsticks in africa they don't use
chopsticks
in the americas they don't use
chopsticks unless they're at a chinese
restaurant
or of course another type of restaurant
they're japanese restaurants in
korean restaurants as well of course but
typically
people use chopsticks to eat their meals
in asia
so these are different ways that people
are different
and they have different cultures of
course it depends on where you were born
where you grew up who are your ancestors
as to how you live your life and there
are so many
different aspects of how to live life
what clothes are you going to wear
what food are you going to eat how are
you going to eat that food
what are the ways that you think about
your family
and the older people in your family how
do you treat them
how do you treat other people in your
neighborhood these
can be different from country to country
and they
all when we talk about these differences
we're talking about different cultures
different traditions
and as always it's very interesting and
useful
to learn about new cultures it's
exciting it's new
and we can gain more knowledge not only
about other people
but also about ourselves when we study
other cultures
and of course it's very important to
understand
other people's cultures when you connect
with them
and you get along with them because we
all live basically in the same place
we'll all live on the same planet so
it's important to understand
and get along with each other okay
that's turned out to be kind of a big
lesson
okay well thanks for studying with me i
hope you learned a lot of good
vocabulary
and some good ideas anyway we'll see you
in the next lesson
take care everybody bye bye

hello everybody
00:09
welcome back to american textbook
00:11
reading my name is brian and we're going
00:13
over
00:13
social book 4 lesson one
00:16
in this video lesson and lesson one is
00:19
about
00:19
different cultures different cultures
00:22
talk about
00:23
how people from different countries
00:26
different
00:26
areas of the world how do they live what
00:29
do they
00:30
eat what kind of clothes do they wear
00:32
what kind of ideas do they have
00:35
these are all different cultures so in
00:37
this unit
00:38
we will discover what people from
00:41
different countries wear
00:43
and how countries can share their
00:46
cultures so let's get into it
00:51
as usual we start with the vocabulary
00:54
the first
00:54
word in our vocabulary list is tradition
00:59
tradition is very important to cultures
01:02
because tradition means
01:05
the customs or beliefs which are handed
01:09
down
01:10
from people before you so traditions
01:13
of course come from a very long
01:16
history and traditions are passed down
01:20
from mother to
01:23
daughter father to son and then from
01:26
grandfather to grandchildren grandmother
01:29
to grandchildren
01:30
and these traditions are passed down in
01:33
stories
01:34
in the way people act in what they say
01:38
and basically how they live so
01:41
traditions
01:43
kind of think about traditions as being
01:46
i want to say old-fashioned but of
01:48
course they are very
01:50
rooted in history and the way that
01:53
previous
01:54
generations did things they will hand
01:56
their their traditions
01:57
down to their children and so on so
02:00
those are traditions
02:03
okay next word ancestor i just mentioned
02:06
this word
02:07
ancestor ancestor is a person in your
02:09
family
02:10
who lived a long time ago
02:13
yeah usually we talk about ancestors as
02:16
people who live you know your great
02:18
grandfather your great great grandfather
02:20
but your grandfather
02:22
and your grandmother and also just your
02:24
parents are also your ancestors and
02:26
they're still with us
02:27
good so a person in your family who
02:29
lived a long time ago
02:31
yeah but also people who are living now
02:34
are also your ancestors
02:35
right but usually when we talk about
02:37
ancestors we're talking about
02:38
the generations that came before you
02:42
so you can think about where did my
02:44
ancestors live how did my ancestors how
02:47
did my ancestors live
02:48
usually when we ask these questions
02:50
we're talking about you know hundreds of
02:52
years ago how did people
02:54
live or where did they come from
02:56
especially if you're from a country that
02:58
has many
02:59
immigrants many people who moved to that
03:01
country like america
03:02
where many people came from other
03:04
countries so you could say where did my
03:05
ancestors come from
03:07
okay next we have
03:10
legend a legend is a story that is
03:13
handed down
03:15
as part of tradition traditions really
03:18
when you think about it they
03:20
are stories most of traditions are just
03:22
stories or they're built
03:23
on stories and stories that become that
03:27
are repeated again and again and they
03:29
become
03:29
part of a culture and usually they're
03:33
maybe they have some basis in fact or
03:36
real history
03:37
but of course they are very uh legends
03:39
are kind of like
03:41
their the the story grows and it becomes
03:44
more and more
03:45
fantastic or more and more impressive
03:48
over time
03:49
as each retelling comes about so
03:52
legends are stories that are very old
03:55
they come down from
03:57
many generations ago and of course when
03:59
you think about legends you can think
04:01
about in the west the greek legends
04:02
about the greek heroes like hercules and
04:05
and perseus right
04:09
these are very amazing stories and
04:13
sometimes of course they're a little
04:14
fantastical
04:16
but they're part of a culture and there
04:18
are
04:19
there are stories also that give reasons
04:22
for why people do certain things
04:24
so they could be legends also another
04:26
word that's very similar to legend
04:28
is myth so myths
04:31
and legends are very important to a
04:34
culture
04:35
okay next we have diversity
04:38
or diversity diversity is the quality
04:42
of being different so if you have a
04:44
group of people like this group of
04:46
young people right here you can see that
04:49
they're they're not all the same
04:50
right they're different right there's
04:52
boys there's girls
04:54
there's different races there could even
04:57
be different
04:58
i'm not sure because they're lying down
05:00
but they can be different heights right
05:02
so diversity just means the quality of
05:04
being different
05:05
people in a group who are not all the
05:08
same or who all look the same
05:10
or who all have the same beliefs or
05:12
ideas
05:13
or ways of living but they have diverse
05:16
if there are different people in the
05:18
group who look different
05:19
who think differently who live
05:22
differently
05:23
then that is a diverse group instead of
05:25
a uniform
05:27
uniform would be the opposite of
05:30
diversity
05:32
uniform so you could have a uniform
05:35
society or you can have a diverse
05:38
society society
05:39
okay but diversity just means the
05:41
quality of being
05:43
different next we have connect
05:46
connect means to join or link together
05:49
there's a famous
05:50
idea about this the six degrees of kevin
05:52
bacon
05:53
that kevin bacon is a famous actor and
05:55
there's an idea that
05:57
everybody knows somebody you know
05:59
somebody who
06:00
is only six who knows maybe less than
06:03
six people
06:04
who personally knows kevin bacon a
06:06
famous actor so
06:08
that's kind of like this picture here
06:09
you know who do you know you know
06:11
how close are you how are you connected
06:13
to other people
06:14
your friends who are their friends who
06:16
are their relatives
06:17
how are all those connections made so to
06:20
connect is to
06:21
join or link together how are you
06:24
connected
06:24
to the people in your neighborhood in
06:27
your city
06:28
in your country in the world right what
06:31
are those connections okay
06:35
okay the next word is take part in
06:39
this is a three part verb right
06:42
to take part in also we call it a
06:45
phrasal verb but it also means
06:47
just to participate part
06:50
two participate
06:54
is a hymduro or difficult word right
06:56
participate
06:58
right partis pay four syllables take
07:02
part in is easier to say it's but it's
07:04
three words right
07:05
take part in so to take part in means to
07:08
join a group that is doing
07:09
something together so if you see a
07:12
soccer game and you want to join the
07:13
soccer game
07:14
you take part in the soccer game or you
07:17
participate in the soccer game
07:19
if you see a group of people eating
07:21
lunch together you say oh
07:22
i want to eat lunch with them so you
07:24
when you join them
07:26
you take part in that group eating lunch
07:29
you participate in their lunch okay but
07:32
take part in means to join a group
07:34
that is doing something together
07:37
next we have chopsticks chopsticks are
07:40
eating utensils you utensils you
07:44
ten souls utensils in the west
07:48
are a knife fork and spoon in
07:51
many asian countries they are chopsticks
07:53
and they are just a pair of sticks
07:55
small sticks you know only about that
07:57
long which people use to eat
07:59
food of course if you're watching me
08:01
from an asian country you're very
08:02
familiar with chopsticks
08:04
uh if you're not then of course
08:06
chopsticks are
08:07
very commonly used in many asian
08:09
countries to
08:11
eat food especially chinese food and you
08:13
know a lot of americans
08:15
do know what chopsticks are and they do
08:16
use them because chinese food
08:18
is very popular in america there's many
08:21
chinese restaurants
08:22
and of course you can ask for chopsticks
08:24
to eat your food at the chinese
08:26
restaurant okay okay our last word is
08:30
meal meal of course is a dish
08:33
of food that you eat during the day
08:35
usually we have
08:37
three meals a day unless of course
08:39
you're a hobbit
08:40
okay it's from the lord of the rings
08:42
they have breakfast and second breakfast
08:44
and
08:44
and so on throughout the day but you
08:46
should only eat three meals a day
08:48
some people only eat two meals a day
08:50
because they want to lose
08:52
weight but traditionally the three meals
08:55
a day
08:55
are breakfast in the morning lunch
08:58
in the middle of the day and dinner in
09:01
the
09:01
evening it looks like this young
09:04
gentleman
09:05
is eating spaghetti probably
09:08
dinner okay that's a lot of spaghetti
09:10
okay so anyway that's a meal and those
09:12
are our words for the lesson
09:17
okay we have the first idea from this
09:19
lesson we have different
09:20
traditions now remember traditions are
09:24
practices beliefs things that are done
09:27
by
09:28
ancestors and passed down to their
09:30
descendants or their children
09:32
so what are some different traditions of
09:34
course if you look at different
09:35
countries
09:36
around the world you'll see that people
09:38
will do everyday
09:40
life things they'll do them differently
09:42
and those are
09:43
different traditions different cultures
09:46
so the first one we have japanese people
09:49
japanese people
09:50
wear their traditional clothes called
09:53
a kimono
09:57
okay so kimono is
10:01
traditional japanese clothing and of
10:04
course
10:04
many different countries will have like
10:06
their traditional
10:08
dress or their traditional clothing
10:11
in japan they use a kimono or they will
10:14
wear a kimono
10:15
in korea korean people wear their
10:18
traditional clothes
10:19
called a hanbok hanbok right
10:22
and those are very colorful and as we
10:25
can see this
10:26
this woman is wearing it it's very
10:27
colorful lots of bright colors
10:29
okay and there it's very when you see
10:32
these
10:33
uh clothes these types of clothes or
10:35
their suits
10:36
of clothing you could say you when you
10:38
see these types of dress
10:40
although don't get confused between a
10:43
woman's
10:43
dress and when we say the traditional
10:47
dress they're different right it's not a
10:49
dress it could be something different
10:52
but when we see these we can immediately
10:54
associate oh
10:56
they're from this country if you see a
10:59
scotsman
11:00
wearing a kilt you know a scottish
11:02
person right
11:03
see a person wearing a handbook saying
11:05
oh from korea
11:06
okay so weak clothes can ease are easily
11:10
distinguishable
11:11
between cultures now in the third um
11:15
box we have people in the u.s who came
11:18
from
11:19
all over the world have various
11:21
traditions so they're not talking about
11:22
dress
11:23
or costume traditional costume national
11:26
costume here
11:27
and in fact it you can't really say that
11:31
there's a national
11:33
um dress or traditional clothes for the
11:36
united states
11:37
because people come from all over the
11:39
world
11:40
and there's no real traditional what is
11:43
the traditional
11:44
uh costume or clothing for an american
11:47
you might some people might be make a
11:50
joke and say oh t-shirt and shorts
11:52
okay maybe but a lot of people do wear
11:55
those
11:56
but you know people from america from
11:57
all sorts of different cultures all
11:59
sorts of different traditions
12:00
and so there are many different types of
12:02
dress i gave you the example of scottish
12:04
there are a lot of scottish americans
12:06
and when they get together and they
12:07
celebrate their scottish heritage
12:10
tradition custom they many of them will
12:13
wear scottish
12:15
uh clothing i almost said dress
12:18
be careful traditional clothing and the
12:21
same thing for other groups as well
12:23
germans
12:24
italians mexicans all sorts of different
12:28
ethnicities and different groups okay
12:32
so those are all different traditions
12:35
next we have sharing cultures now it's
12:37
very interesting to go around the world
12:39
and to look at how other people live
12:41
because it's really you can expand your
12:43
mind and you can gain a lot of knowledge
12:46
about different ways to live so let's
12:49
take a look
12:50
at examples from different cultures
12:52
around the world and see
12:54
how they can be shared for example
12:57
origami you've probably heard of origami
13:00
origami is japan's
13:01
paper folding tradition and it's a
13:04
tradition
13:05
and it's spread throughout the world we
13:07
see it people in many different
13:09
countries
13:10
have adopted so you can adopt
13:14
a tradition or adopt part of a tradition
13:16
you can adopt a tradition
13:17
and you can do it yourself so origami is
13:20
a very
13:21
uh popular hobby all over the world that
13:23
started in japan
13:25
but it's making little animals out of
13:27
paper
13:28
and we can even see it in movies right
13:30
there's a famous movie blade runner and
13:32
one of the characters
13:33
was doing this so you know origami is
13:35
really spread worldwide
13:38
next we have music music is a very
13:40
important part of culture as well
13:42
besides stories and food and clothing
13:45
in mexico mariachi mariachi i hope i
13:49
pronounced that right mariachi
13:50
is the traditional music of mexico
13:54
and you can hear mariachi singers or
13:57
mariachi bands
13:59
it might be a little bit common
14:02
uh to think of that if you go to a
14:04
mexican restaurant especially in the
14:06
southwest of america
14:08
there might be little mariachi bands a
14:10
group of usually three musicians
14:12
who come and they'll sing mexican songs
14:14
at your table in
14:16
the restaurant and we can also see that
14:18
in tv and movies as well
14:20
so that's the traditional music of
14:22
mexico
14:24
next we have a tradition coming from
14:26
ghana ghana is a country in africa
14:29
and we have a legend so again legends
14:32
are old stories you know about
14:34
uh you may be talking animals or heroes
14:37
that do
14:37
fantastic deeds well
14:41
from ghana is this legend called a nancy
14:43
the spider
14:44
a nancy when i first asked how do you
14:46
pronounce that i looked it up it sounds
14:48
like
14:48
a nancy like a jane but no it's
14:52
don't say ah nancy just say a nancy a
14:54
nancy the spider
14:56
is a legend from ghana and it's a story
14:58
about a spider
15:00
these types of stories that are very old
15:03
are passed down from generation to
15:05
generation
15:06
and they're in many cases they're
15:08
entertaining but
15:09
in many cases also they have a story
15:13
or a moral a lesson behind the story
15:16
that kind of reinforces the beliefs of a
15:19
certain group of people
15:21
okay so those are our two ideas from the
15:23
lesson now let's take a look at the
15:25
reading
15:27
okay now it's time for the reading so
15:29
let's take a look we're looking at
15:31
different cultures
15:32
in this lesson of course so we're
15:34
talking about different traditions and
15:36
we'll be looking at different traditions
15:37
in the reading passage
15:39
as i read as usual try to read along
15:42
with me
15:43
practice the pronunciation of these
15:45
words
15:46
if it's not practical if it's not a good
15:48
idea to read out loud you might be
15:50
disturbing somebody around you or read
15:52
along in your mind
15:53
and focus on the vocabulary of course
15:55
and try to pick up
15:56
any new words are you guys ready let's
15:59
begin
16:01
different people and cultures have
16:05
different traditions for example
16:09
in japan people wear traditional clothes
16:13
called a kimono
16:17
okay on the other hand korean people
16:21
wear a hanbak
16:26
sometimes different cultures have
16:30
similar traditions in both
16:33
japan and korea people use
16:36
chopsticks to eat their meals
16:41
traditions come from ancestors
16:44
who lived a long time ago
16:48
interestingly every culture
16:51
has its own stories
16:54
legends are interesting stories
16:58
which also come from long
17:01
ago there
17:04
is a lot of diversity in the united
17:06
states
17:07
because people there came from all
17:11
over the world sharing customs
17:14
and traditions is a way that american
17:17
citizens
17:18
can connect with each other
17:23
taking part in learning about other
17:26
people's traditions
17:28
is a way to make their community an
17:32
interesting place it is also
17:35
a good way to help americans get along
17:39
with each other so this is a very good
17:43
lesson actually for living in a
17:46
multi-cultural
17:47
society a multi-cultural society
17:50
it's important to learn about each
17:52
other's cultures
17:54
it's interesting and it helps people get
17:56
along
17:57
okay this reading passage is organized
18:01
by
18:02
main idea and then details that support
18:05
that main idea what is the main idea
18:09
the main idea is that different people
18:11
and cultures
18:12
have different beep so what
18:16
word did we talk about in the vocabulary
18:19
that means the beliefs the practices the
18:23
way that people
18:24
think and talk about themselves they are
18:27
different
18:28
traditions okay
18:33
so different people and cultures have
18:35
different
18:36
traditions s because there's more than
18:39
one tradition
18:40
tradition there's a japanese tradition
18:41
there's korean tradition
18:43
they there's countdowns traditions
18:47
okay good so an example what's an
18:49
example of that so now we need some
18:51
details to support that
18:53
idea an example is um in japan
18:56
people wear traditional clothes called a
18:59
or
18:59
an they're trying to trick you there but
19:01
of course we use a
19:02
because it's a kimono a kimono
19:06
so akimo no a kimono
19:10
okay so people wear traditional clothes
19:14
called
19:14
a kimono in korea people wear
19:18
a or an of course it's a because it's
19:21
hanbak
19:22
right so
19:25
okay good so different styles of
19:28
clothing
19:28
okay now those are different things
19:31
right um
19:33
they're different styles but there's
19:35
also a detail
19:37
it's interesting because the detail
19:38
doesn't really support the main idea but
19:40
it's
19:40
you know it was in the passage that you
19:42
know sir people have different
19:44
traditions
19:45
and they may have different ways of
19:47
doing something but in some ways they're
19:49
also similar
19:50
so in both japan and korea people use
19:53
beep to eat their meals what do they use
19:56
i have one part right i need another
19:58
part
19:58
people use chopsticks chop sticks
20:03
chop sticks
20:06
a little hard to write with his pen
20:09
people use chopsticks
20:10
to eat their meals so yeah that is
20:13
different because not everybody does it
20:16
outside of asia in europe they don't use
20:17
chopsticks in africa they don't use
20:19
chopsticks
20:20
in the americas they don't use
20:21
chopsticks unless they're at a chinese
20:23
restaurant
20:24
or of course another type of restaurant
20:25
they're japanese restaurants in
20:27
korean restaurants as well of course but
20:30
typically
20:30
people use chopsticks to eat their meals
20:32
in asia
20:34
so these are different ways that people
20:37
are different
20:38
and they have different cultures of
20:39
course it depends on where you were born
20:41
where you grew up who are your ancestors
20:44
as to how you live your life and there
20:47
are so many
20:48
different aspects of how to live life
20:50
what clothes are you going to wear
20:52
what food are you going to eat how are
20:54
you going to eat that food
20:56
what are the ways that you think about
20:58
your family
20:59
and the older people in your family how
21:02
do you treat them
21:03
how do you treat other people in your
21:05
neighborhood these
21:07
can be different from country to country
21:10
and they
21:10
all when we talk about these differences
21:14
we're talking about different cultures
21:16
different traditions
21:17
and as always it's very interesting and
21:20
useful
21:21
to learn about new cultures it's
21:23
exciting it's new
21:25
and we can gain more knowledge not only
21:27
about other people
21:28
but also about ourselves when we study
21:31
other cultures
21:32
and of course it's very important to
21:34
understand
21:35
other people's cultures when you connect
21:38
with them
21:38
and you get along with them because we
21:40
all live basically in the same place
21:43
we'll all live on the same planet so
21:45
it's important to understand
21:46
and get along with each other okay
21:49
that's turned out to be kind of a big
21:51
lesson
21:51
okay well thanks for studying with me i
21:53
hope you learned a lot of good
21:54
vocabulary
21:55
and some good ideas anyway we'll see you
21:58
in the next lesson
21:59
take care everybody bye bye
