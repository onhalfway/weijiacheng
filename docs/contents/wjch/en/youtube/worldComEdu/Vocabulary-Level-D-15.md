[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to
reading for vocabulary we're on our last
lesson of the book
i hope you enjoyed studying with me but
we have one more lesson to go
so we have some more something more
interesting to go over before
we finish with the book and of course
we're still talking about the topic
of cycles right things that go around
that
continue and continue they don't really
have a beginning or
end they just continue to go this
lesson lesson 15 we're talking about as
the earth
moves so now we're talking about the
cycle of the earth's
motion as you know you should know
the earth moves around the sun that's a
cycle
but we'll talk about some other cycles
too that you may not know about
concerning the earth motion so that's
what we're going to read about
we're going to focus on earth's motion
and
weather so we're not just talking about
the motion
of the earth but we're also talking
about
how does that affect the weather
how does that change the weather on
earth
right when the earth is moving through
space
what effect how does that change the
weather
on earth so it'll be an interesting
lesson about that
but of course as usual let's study some
vocabulary
so that we can understand the reading
passage more quickly
when we get to that okay the first word
on our word list is defined as
to understand well and i hope you've
understood
my lessons well what is another word to
understand well it's to comprehend
it's a big word right come pre-hand
only three sounds so not so bad
comprehend
comprehend means that you understand
well
so like i said i hope that you
comprehend
my lessons with you well i hope that you
can comprehend
and i hope that i explain things well
enough okay good so number two
to make bear when you make something
bare
like when i get a haircut right
i expose my head if i get a really short
haircut so you can see my skin
then i've exposed my head right to
expose
something to make bare if i roll up my
sleeves you can see the skin on my arms
i have
exposed my arms right i'm not going to
do it it takes too long
but you get the idea right you take off
a hat
you've exposed your head to the sky
outside okay so to expose to make bear
next one half of a sphere now a sphere
what is a sphere
a sphere is a round shape but not just
two dimension three dimensional that's a
sphere
so if we look at the earth right the
earth is a
three-dimensional circle right it's a
sphere
a circle is only two dimensions right a
circle is just
two dimensions but a sphere is
three dimensions we can see the shape
in 3d okay so half of the spear but now
we're talking about
half half of a sphere so if we talk
about
half of the world usually we talk about
like the northern half
or the southern half and when we do that
we use a special word
and that word is hemi sphere
hemi now think of this word it's one
word
but think of it in two sections first we
have
hemi and then we have sphere
of course you know a lot of english
words or are shorter words or smaller
words that are joined together
in this case hemi is a greek
uh word it's it has its origins in the
greek language
as many words do have origins in greek
or latin right in this case hemi is a
greek
prefix hemi means
half hemi is half so if we say hemi
half a sphere we're talking about
half of a sphere and so we say the
northern
hemisphere or the southern
hemisphere sometimes people will also
say the western hemisphere
and the eastern hemisphere saying that
the west
is for example europe and america
and the east is asia uh right sometimes
people will say that
uh but usually you know it's it's hard
to say you know where where does it stop
and end
but it's easy to know north and south
because there's the
equator right there's the equator right
here that is a good
dividing line for north and south so we
can easily say northern hemisphere
and southern hemisphere okay next word
number four maybe you've seen this
picture before it's not
to scale right if it was to scale it
would be too big we couldn't show it
here
but this shows the sun and all the
planets
around the sun and we see that the
planets
have these lines these circles going
around
and we see to move around an object in
space right this is space out here
nothing's really out there
also we see a comet over here that also
moves around an
object in space all of these objects are
moving around the sun
we say they are orbiting around the sun
so mercury venus earth mars
they are all orbiting around the sun
they are moving around the sun the comet
is moving around the sun
now on a planet like jupiter which has
many
little moons those moons are orbiting
around jupiter our moon the moon that we
see
at night orbits around earth
okay so there are many different orbits
that we can see
in the night sky it just means an object
a big object is moving well not even a
big object could be a small object like
when astronauts go into space
they go around the earth they are
orbiting the earth
to move around another object in a
circle or some type of circle
okay number five the very top or bottom
of the earth so here we're looking at
antarctica
antarctica and on the other side of
course there's no land
right antarctica is a land mass there's
no land on the other side but what we're
talking about we're talking about the
very top
or bottom of the earth of course we're
talking about the poles
and here we see the south pole
antarctica
is at the south pole there's no land at
the north pole
but there is ice right and animals do
live up there like for example polar
bears live
on the north pole santa claus has his
house
at the north pole right okay so so these
are the poles
south pole or north pole number six
to be on top of so to be on top of
especially to
be all over the top of not just sitting
on the top here
but all over the top means to cover
so this blanket is all over the top of
the car and it hides the car
actually we can't see the car we know
it's a car because we can see part of it
right here
but if we can't see it we see that the
this blanket or the sheet
covers the car okay so cover doesn't
just mean to be on top of something
like for example there's a dog here
right i'm not a very good artist
but okay anyway that's a that's my
doggie
if the dog is sitting up there the dog
is not covering the car
to cover means to cover all the the
entire surface
of something to to cover a large
surface of something that's to cover
seven
not circular shaped like an egg so this
looks like a mirror
right okay but it's not a circular a
circle is more like this now can i draw
a circle
i'm okay that's not a very good circle i
again i'm not a very good artist
but if you can draw a perfect circle
very quickly perfect circle
that's a circle but this is not a circle
this looks like an
egg so what do we call it we call it
elliptical
elliptical now an easier word of course
is also
oval an oval shape this would be an oval
shape
but more scientific word is elliptical
elliptical elliptical shape
is like an oval it's not a perfect
circle
okay eight a particular length
of time so a particular length of time
you know
beginning and ending and we call that
you know that's a certain period of time
i just gave you the word period a period
of time
is what we call a particular length so
an hour
is a period of time a minute is another
period of time
a second is a period of time so there's
many different
periods of time it's just a particular
length of time
we give it a name okay number nine
now this girl has a decision to make
right
she can go right or she can go left so
she's thinking
of something what is the verb that means
to think of something
especially to to think about it deeply
is to
consider she is considering okay what's
the fastest way to get to the store
should i go right or should i go left
okay so she's thinking about it
okay she's considering her choices
especially when we have a choice to make
we consider the good points and the bad
points about each choice and then we
make our decision
so we consider number 10
something that influences or has a part
in so something that influences or has a
part in we call that a
factor now this is more of a
maybe a scientific word right a factor
is like
for example i just said we think about
the good points or bad points
all the good points that's a factor all
the negative or bad
points those are also factors we call
those
pros and cons
right pros are good points and
cons are bad points these are all the
factors
that we use we think of all these things
when we consider
something so they're all the things that
influence
our choice or has a part in
our choice or the result of something
those are factors okay next one
uh oh somebody's in trouble right i
think the cat knocked over the uh the
potted plant and the dog is looking at
the cat saying
you're in trouble you know when master
comes home okay
to be the cause of something is to be
responsible
for responsible so
re spawn
bull responsible
who is responsible for this mess
who is responsible for breaking
the pot i think it's the cat what do you
think who's responsible
but sometimes you know if something
happens there's an accident that happens
people will ask who's responsible
they'll also ask another word
they'll use another word fault right
fault
and when you use fault you can say it's
my fault if you say it's my fault that
means
i am responsible i
am responsible i am responsible
it's my fault whose fault
is it who is responsible it means the
same thing
okay 12. oh kimchio
maybe capchio maybe a little ugly but
it's very cute
right these two dogs in a very small way
now what are we talking about we're
talking about slightly
so these two dogs are slightly similar
i'm not
really sure what we're going we're doing
with the picture here but slightly
in a very small way maybe they're
licking their lips
slightly or just a little bit in a very
small way
slightly if you do something but it's
not in a big way it's in a small way
you can say slightly give you another
example
it rains right sometimes it rains
heavily
really coming down that's not slightly
it's not slightly raining
it's heavily raining but if it's raining
and just the little
tiny drops are coming down you could
almost go outside without an umbrella
you won't get too wet it's just raining
slightly just
joking all right
right just a little bit of rain is
falling from the sky
it's slightly raining okay next one
here looks like a calendar monday
tuesday wednesday
not long lasting if something doesn't
last a long time
it only lasts one two or three days it
doesn't last very long
depending on what it is right if we're
sick for three days we think it's a long
time
but really it's just short term right
it's done in three days it's over
in a day or three days right short term
it doesn't last very long what's the
opposite of short term
well of course we would say long term
pandero
right long term is the opposite pandero
of short term so you can talk about
something that's short term
you talk about something that's long
term okay those are
opposites fourteen now somebody made a
mistake here right one plus one
equals three that's crazy the word is
defined as something that is smart and
logical we would say
it's it it sensible sense it makes
sense now usually when we use sense
in a sentence we don't say it's sense
don't say it's
sense say it
makes sense
you have to remember use this word here
it makes sense don't just say
it's it's sense no it makes
sense now this doesn't make sense this
doesn't doesn't
it doesn't make and then we use s
because it doesn't
it doesn't make sense one plus one
equals three
that doesn't make sense okay it's
not smart it's not logical okay
so when we use the word sense we use it
to describe something that's smart
and logical that makes sense that's
logical
well something is not logical we say
it doesn't make sense okay
okay next one for the entire year
and of course this looks like i'm not
sure but i think it's
mount everest in the himalayas and you
think about mount everest whenever you
think about mount everest
you think of snow and it doesn't matter
what time of year it is
it could even be the summer time there's
still snow
in the mountains on this mountain
because the mountain's so high
so for the entire year we say
year round there is snow
there is snow year round on mount
everest
that means all year long there is snow
on mount everest it's year long okay
last one according to science this guy
is very smart right he's
he's doing some kind of engineering
diagram
okay technically if you he's
doing something and he's he's getting
into you know according
very specifically how it's used
technically
uh you know you could say it's according
to a scientific method
according to science it's done in a very
logical or in a very detailed
way and you're breaking down all the
different parts how is each part going
to work
well that's a technical drawing so
they've done it very technically
now sometimes people will use this word
technically
right adverb to describe something exact
for example a lot of things we say we
just say
generally and they may not be true
right exactly they might not be true in
all cases
so in that case we say well technically
that's not true
technically okay well that's
that's not the common case you know
generally it's this way
but technically it might be a little
different okay so we'll see that later
on in the reading passage
okay let's go over these words here
let's do the exercises
choose the word the best completes a
sentence can you
beep this math problem so when you're
looking at a
math problem sometimes math problems are
difficult to understand so we might ask
our friend
can you what this math problem usually
maybe we're looking for a word like
solve or understand right
well what word means that a behave b
comprehend
c orbit and d cover well of course we're
looking for
comprehend can you comprehend this math
problem
because comprehend means do you
understand this math problem
if you understand it if you understand
it
then you can solve the math problem
first though you need to comprehend it
you need to understand it
once you understand it then you can
solve it
right so not can you behave not can you
orbit this math problem that's weird uh
can you cover this math problem oh i'm
afraid cover it hide it right that's
that's strange too
what we want is can you comprehend this
math problem
do you understand it okay next one is a
command
beep your eyes you shouldn't see this
so if your friend says oh don't look
right you want to do this
to your eyes what am i doing right so i
cannot see something
am i orbiting my eyes
that would be really weird right my eyes
turn around that's strange
now i'm not orbiting my eyes am i
comprehending my eyes well i understand
my eyes but i can still see
that's weird right we don't say that
make your eyes
how do you make your eyes that doesn't
make sense
cover ah cover your eyes right
so you have a surprise i want to
surprise you cover your eyes
open a surprise right so first cover
your eyes that's the answer cover your
eyes you
shouldn't see this so you don't want
somebody to see something
cover your eyes okay next one
number five i have a short beep of time
for lunch
so you have a certain length of time for
lunch it's a short length of time
what do we say i have a short orbit of
time i have a short
poll of time i have a short period of
time
or i have a short cover of time which
one sounds good
probably you chose period whoa that's
too fast okay but anyway
i have a short period of time i have a
short
period of time for lunch so maybe only
30 minutes
30 minute period for lunch not one hour
just 30 minutes so it's a short period
of time
now this one jumped up too quickly but
that's okay the north pole
is in the arctic remember we talked
about pole
right we have a north pole and a south
pole those are the top and the bottom of
the earth
and the north pole is in the arctic not
the north orbit
not the north cover not the north period
that's weird but the north pole
the north pole is in the arctic where is
the south pole
the south pole is in the antarctic ant
are arctic yes if we can spell it right
oh yes we did okay arctic okay
you can see because arctic you just use
arctic here but antarctic
means the opposite antarctic okay so
arctic
antarctic okay well that wraps it up for
the
vocabulary section next we're going to
use those words in the reading passage
so stay tuned don't go away

hello everybody welcome back to
00:10
reading for vocabulary we're on our last
00:13
lesson of the book
00:15
i hope you enjoyed studying with me but
00:17
we have one more lesson to go
00:19
so we have some more something more
00:21
interesting to go over before
00:23
we finish with the book and of course
00:25
we're still talking about the topic
00:27
of cycles right things that go around
00:30
that
00:31
continue and continue they don't really
00:33
have a beginning or
00:34
end they just continue to go this
00:37
lesson lesson 15 we're talking about as
00:40
the earth
00:41
moves so now we're talking about the
00:43
cycle of the earth's
00:45
motion as you know you should know
00:48
the earth moves around the sun that's a
00:51
cycle
00:52
but we'll talk about some other cycles
00:54
too that you may not know about
00:57
concerning the earth motion so that's
01:00
what we're going to read about
01:01
we're going to focus on earth's motion
01:04
and
01:04
weather so we're not just talking about
01:07
the motion
01:08
of the earth but we're also talking
01:10
about
01:11
how does that affect the weather
01:14
how does that change the weather on
01:17
earth
01:18
right when the earth is moving through
01:20
space
01:21
what effect how does that change the
01:24
weather
01:24
on earth so it'll be an interesting
01:26
lesson about that
01:28
but of course as usual let's study some
01:30
vocabulary
01:31
so that we can understand the reading
01:33
passage more quickly
01:35
when we get to that okay the first word
01:38
on our word list is defined as
01:41
to understand well and i hope you've
01:44
understood
01:45
my lessons well what is another word to
01:48
understand well it's to comprehend
01:52
it's a big word right come pre-hand
01:55
only three sounds so not so bad
01:58
comprehend
01:59
comprehend means that you understand
02:02
well
02:02
so like i said i hope that you
02:04
comprehend
02:06
my lessons with you well i hope that you
02:08
can comprehend
02:09
and i hope that i explain things well
02:11
enough okay good so number two
02:14
to make bear when you make something
02:16
bare
02:17
like when i get a haircut right
02:20
i expose my head if i get a really short
02:24
haircut so you can see my skin
02:26
then i've exposed my head right to
02:29
expose
02:30
something to make bare if i roll up my
02:33
sleeves you can see the skin on my arms
02:36
i have
02:37
exposed my arms right i'm not going to
02:40
do it it takes too long
02:41
but you get the idea right you take off
02:44
a hat
02:44
you've exposed your head to the sky
02:47
outside okay so to expose to make bear
02:51
next one half of a sphere now a sphere
02:54
what is a sphere
02:56
a sphere is a round shape but not just
03:00
two dimension three dimensional that's a
03:03
sphere
03:04
so if we look at the earth right the
03:06
earth is a
03:08
three-dimensional circle right it's a
03:10
sphere
03:11
a circle is only two dimensions right a
03:14
circle is just
03:16
two dimensions but a sphere is
03:19
three dimensions we can see the shape
03:22
in 3d okay so half of the spear but now
03:25
we're talking about
03:26
half half of a sphere so if we talk
03:29
about
03:30
half of the world usually we talk about
03:32
like the northern half
03:34
or the southern half and when we do that
03:36
we use a special word
03:38
and that word is hemi sphere
03:42
hemi now think of this word it's one
03:45
word
03:45
but think of it in two sections first we
03:48
have
03:49
hemi and then we have sphere
03:52
of course you know a lot of english
03:53
words or are shorter words or smaller
03:56
words that are joined together
03:58
in this case hemi is a greek
04:01
uh word it's it has its origins in the
04:04
greek language
04:05
as many words do have origins in greek
04:08
or latin right in this case hemi is a
04:11
greek
04:11
prefix hemi means
04:15
half hemi is half so if we say hemi
04:19
half a sphere we're talking about
04:22
half of a sphere and so we say the
04:24
northern
04:26
hemisphere or the southern
04:29
hemisphere sometimes people will also
04:31
say the western hemisphere
04:33
and the eastern hemisphere saying that
04:36
the west
04:37
is for example europe and america
04:40
and the east is asia uh right sometimes
04:43
people will say that
04:44
uh but usually you know it's it's hard
04:46
to say you know where where does it stop
04:48
and end
04:48
but it's easy to know north and south
04:51
because there's the
04:52
equator right there's the equator right
04:55
here that is a good
04:57
dividing line for north and south so we
05:00
can easily say northern hemisphere
05:02
and southern hemisphere okay next word
05:06
number four maybe you've seen this
05:08
picture before it's not
05:10
to scale right if it was to scale it
05:12
would be too big we couldn't show it
05:14
here
05:15
but this shows the sun and all the
05:17
planets
05:18
around the sun and we see that the
05:22
planets
05:23
have these lines these circles going
05:25
around
05:26
and we see to move around an object in
05:29
space right this is space out here
05:31
nothing's really out there
05:32
also we see a comet over here that also
05:35
moves around an
05:36
object in space all of these objects are
05:38
moving around the sun
05:41
we say they are orbiting around the sun
05:44
so mercury venus earth mars
05:47
they are all orbiting around the sun
05:51
they are moving around the sun the comet
05:53
is moving around the sun
05:55
now on a planet like jupiter which has
05:58
many
05:58
little moons those moons are orbiting
06:02
around jupiter our moon the moon that we
06:05
see
06:06
at night orbits around earth
06:09
okay so there are many different orbits
06:11
that we can see
06:12
in the night sky it just means an object
06:15
a big object is moving well not even a
06:17
big object could be a small object like
06:19
when astronauts go into space
06:21
they go around the earth they are
06:23
orbiting the earth
06:25
to move around another object in a
06:27
circle or some type of circle
06:30
okay number five the very top or bottom
06:33
of the earth so here we're looking at
06:35
antarctica
06:36
antarctica and on the other side of
06:38
course there's no land
06:40
right antarctica is a land mass there's
06:43
no land on the other side but what we're
06:44
talking about we're talking about the
06:46
very top
06:47
or bottom of the earth of course we're
06:50
talking about the poles
06:51
and here we see the south pole
06:54
antarctica
06:55
is at the south pole there's no land at
06:58
the north pole
06:58
but there is ice right and animals do
07:02
live up there like for example polar
07:03
bears live
07:04
on the north pole santa claus has his
07:07
house
07:08
at the north pole right okay so so these
07:11
are the poles
07:12
south pole or north pole number six
07:16
to be on top of so to be on top of
07:19
especially to
07:21
be all over the top of not just sitting
07:24
on the top here
07:25
but all over the top means to cover
07:29
so this blanket is all over the top of
07:32
the car and it hides the car
07:34
actually we can't see the car we know
07:36
it's a car because we can see part of it
07:37
right here
07:38
but if we can't see it we see that the
07:41
this blanket or the sheet
07:43
covers the car okay so cover doesn't
07:46
just mean to be on top of something
07:48
like for example there's a dog here
07:51
right i'm not a very good artist
07:52
but okay anyway that's a that's my
07:54
doggie
07:56
if the dog is sitting up there the dog
07:58
is not covering the car
07:59
to cover means to cover all the the
08:02
entire surface
08:04
of something to to cover a large
08:07
surface of something that's to cover
08:10
seven
08:12
not circular shaped like an egg so this
08:14
looks like a mirror
08:16
right okay but it's not a circular a
08:18
circle is more like this now can i draw
08:20
a circle
08:21
i'm okay that's not a very good circle i
08:24
again i'm not a very good artist
08:25
but if you can draw a perfect circle
08:27
very quickly perfect circle
08:29
that's a circle but this is not a circle
08:32
this looks like an
08:33
egg so what do we call it we call it
08:36
elliptical
08:37
elliptical now an easier word of course
08:40
is also
08:41
oval an oval shape this would be an oval
08:44
shape
08:45
but more scientific word is elliptical
08:49
elliptical elliptical shape
08:52
is like an oval it's not a perfect
08:55
circle
08:56
okay eight a particular length
08:59
of time so a particular length of time
09:02
you know
09:03
beginning and ending and we call that
09:05
you know that's a certain period of time
09:06
i just gave you the word period a period
09:09
of time
09:10
is what we call a particular length so
09:13
an hour
09:14
is a period of time a minute is another
09:17
period of time
09:18
a second is a period of time so there's
09:21
many different
09:21
periods of time it's just a particular
09:24
length of time
09:25
we give it a name okay number nine
09:29
now this girl has a decision to make
09:32
right
09:32
she can go right or she can go left so
09:35
she's thinking
09:36
of something what is the verb that means
09:38
to think of something
09:39
especially to to think about it deeply
09:42
is to
09:42
consider she is considering okay what's
09:46
the fastest way to get to the store
09:48
should i go right or should i go left
09:50
okay so she's thinking about it
09:52
okay she's considering her choices
09:55
especially when we have a choice to make
09:57
we consider the good points and the bad
10:00
points about each choice and then we
10:03
make our decision
10:04
so we consider number 10
10:07
something that influences or has a part
10:11
in so something that influences or has a
10:13
part in we call that a
10:15
factor now this is more of a
10:18
maybe a scientific word right a factor
10:21
is like
10:22
for example i just said we think about
10:23
the good points or bad points
10:25
all the good points that's a factor all
10:28
the negative or bad
10:29
points those are also factors we call
10:32
those
10:32
pros and cons
10:36
right pros are good points and
10:39
cons are bad points these are all the
10:42
factors
10:43
that we use we think of all these things
10:45
when we consider
10:46
something so they're all the things that
10:49
influence
10:50
our choice or has a part in
10:53
our choice or the result of something
10:57
those are factors okay next one
11:00
uh oh somebody's in trouble right i
11:03
think the cat knocked over the uh the
11:05
potted plant and the dog is looking at
11:07
the cat saying
11:08
you're in trouble you know when master
11:10
comes home okay
11:12
to be the cause of something is to be
11:15
responsible
11:16
for responsible so
11:19
re spawn
11:23
bull responsible
11:26
who is responsible for this mess
11:31
who is responsible for breaking
11:34
the pot i think it's the cat what do you
11:37
think who's responsible
11:39
but sometimes you know if something
11:40
happens there's an accident that happens
11:43
people will ask who's responsible
11:45
they'll also ask another word
11:47
they'll use another word fault right
11:50
fault
11:51
and when you use fault you can say it's
11:56
my fault if you say it's my fault that
12:00
means
12:00
i am responsible i
12:04
am responsible i am responsible
12:07
it's my fault whose fault
12:11
is it who is responsible it means the
12:14
same thing
12:15
okay 12. oh kimchio
12:19
maybe capchio maybe a little ugly but
12:22
it's very cute
12:23
right these two dogs in a very small way
12:26
now what are we talking about we're
12:28
talking about slightly
12:30
so these two dogs are slightly similar
12:34
i'm not
12:35
really sure what we're going we're doing
12:36
with the picture here but slightly
12:38
in a very small way maybe they're
12:40
licking their lips
12:41
slightly or just a little bit in a very
12:44
small way
12:45
slightly if you do something but it's
12:47
not in a big way it's in a small way
12:49
you can say slightly give you another
12:52
example
12:53
it rains right sometimes it rains
12:55
heavily
12:56
really coming down that's not slightly
12:59
it's not slightly raining
13:01
it's heavily raining but if it's raining
13:03
and just the little
13:04
tiny drops are coming down you could
13:06
almost go outside without an umbrella
13:09
you won't get too wet it's just raining
13:12
slightly just
13:13
joking all right
13:16
right just a little bit of rain is
13:19
falling from the sky
13:20
it's slightly raining okay next one
13:23
here looks like a calendar monday
13:25
tuesday wednesday
13:27
not long lasting if something doesn't
13:30
last a long time
13:31
it only lasts one two or three days it
13:34
doesn't last very long
13:36
depending on what it is right if we're
13:38
sick for three days we think it's a long
13:40
time
13:40
but really it's just short term right
13:43
it's done in three days it's over
13:45
in a day or three days right short term
13:49
it doesn't last very long what's the
13:51
opposite of short term
13:53
well of course we would say long term
13:55
pandero
13:56
right long term is the opposite pandero
14:00
of short term so you can talk about
14:02
something that's short term
14:03
you talk about something that's long
14:06
term okay those are
14:07
opposites fourteen now somebody made a
14:11
mistake here right one plus one
14:13
equals three that's crazy the word is
14:16
defined as something that is smart and
14:19
logical we would say
14:20
it's it it sensible sense it makes
14:23
sense now usually when we use sense
14:27
in a sentence we don't say it's sense
14:29
don't say it's
14:30
sense say it
14:33
makes sense
14:37
you have to remember use this word here
14:41
it makes sense don't just say
14:44
it's it's sense no it makes
14:47
sense now this doesn't make sense this
14:51
doesn't doesn't
14:55
it doesn't make and then we use s
14:58
because it doesn't
14:59
it doesn't make sense one plus one
15:02
equals three
15:03
that doesn't make sense okay it's
15:06
not smart it's not logical okay
15:09
so when we use the word sense we use it
15:12
to describe something that's smart
15:13
and logical that makes sense that's
15:16
logical
15:17
well something is not logical we say
15:20
it doesn't make sense okay
15:24
okay next one for the entire year
15:27
and of course this looks like i'm not
15:30
sure but i think it's
15:31
mount everest in the himalayas and you
15:33
think about mount everest whenever you
15:35
think about mount everest
15:37
you think of snow and it doesn't matter
15:40
what time of year it is
15:41
it could even be the summer time there's
15:44
still snow
15:45
in the mountains on this mountain
15:47
because the mountain's so high
15:48
so for the entire year we say
15:51
year round there is snow
15:55
there is snow year round on mount
15:59
everest
15:59
that means all year long there is snow
16:02
on mount everest it's year long okay
16:06
last one according to science this guy
16:09
is very smart right he's
16:11
he's doing some kind of engineering
16:13
diagram
16:14
okay technically if you he's
16:17
doing something and he's he's getting
16:19
into you know according
16:22
very specifically how it's used
16:24
technically
16:26
uh you know you could say it's according
16:28
to a scientific method
16:29
according to science it's done in a very
16:33
logical or in a very detailed
16:36
way and you're breaking down all the
16:38
different parts how is each part going
16:40
to work
16:41
well that's a technical drawing so
16:43
they've done it very technically
16:45
now sometimes people will use this word
16:47
technically
16:48
right adverb to describe something exact
16:52
for example a lot of things we say we
16:55
just say
16:56
generally and they may not be true
16:59
right exactly they might not be true in
17:01
all cases
17:02
so in that case we say well technically
17:05
that's not true
17:07
technically okay well that's
17:10
that's not the common case you know
17:12
generally it's this way
17:13
but technically it might be a little
17:15
different okay so we'll see that later
17:17
on in the reading passage
17:19
okay let's go over these words here
17:20
let's do the exercises
17:22
choose the word the best completes a
17:24
sentence can you
17:25
beep this math problem so when you're
17:28
looking at a
17:29
math problem sometimes math problems are
17:33
difficult to understand so we might ask
17:36
our friend
17:37
can you what this math problem usually
17:39
maybe we're looking for a word like
17:41
solve or understand right
17:44
well what word means that a behave b
17:46
comprehend
17:47
c orbit and d cover well of course we're
17:50
looking for
17:51
comprehend can you comprehend this math
17:54
problem
17:55
because comprehend means do you
17:56
understand this math problem
17:59
if you understand it if you understand
18:01
it
18:02
then you can solve the math problem
18:05
first though you need to comprehend it
18:07
you need to understand it
18:09
once you understand it then you can
18:11
solve it
18:12
right so not can you behave not can you
18:15
orbit this math problem that's weird uh
18:18
can you cover this math problem oh i'm
18:21
afraid cover it hide it right that's
18:23
that's strange too
18:24
what we want is can you comprehend this
18:27
math problem
18:28
do you understand it okay next one is a
18:31
command
18:31
beep your eyes you shouldn't see this
18:34
so if your friend says oh don't look
18:36
right you want to do this
18:38
to your eyes what am i doing right so i
18:40
cannot see something
18:42
am i orbiting my eyes
18:45
that would be really weird right my eyes
18:46
turn around that's strange
18:48
now i'm not orbiting my eyes am i
18:50
comprehending my eyes well i understand
18:52
my eyes but i can still see
18:54
that's weird right we don't say that
18:57
make your eyes
18:58
how do you make your eyes that doesn't
19:00
make sense
19:02
cover ah cover your eyes right
19:05
so you have a surprise i want to
19:06
surprise you cover your eyes
19:09
open a surprise right so first cover
19:12
your eyes that's the answer cover your
19:14
eyes you
19:15
shouldn't see this so you don't want
19:17
somebody to see something
19:19
cover your eyes okay next one
19:23
number five i have a short beep of time
19:26
for lunch
19:27
so you have a certain length of time for
19:31
lunch it's a short length of time
19:33
what do we say i have a short orbit of
19:35
time i have a short
19:37
poll of time i have a short period of
19:39
time
19:40
or i have a short cover of time which
19:43
one sounds good
19:44
probably you chose period whoa that's
19:47
too fast okay but anyway
19:48
i have a short period of time i have a
19:51
short
19:51
period of time for lunch so maybe only
19:53
30 minutes
19:54
30 minute period for lunch not one hour
19:56
just 30 minutes so it's a short period
19:58
of time
19:59
now this one jumped up too quickly but
20:01
that's okay the north pole
20:03
is in the arctic remember we talked
20:06
about pole
20:07
right we have a north pole and a south
20:09
pole those are the top and the bottom of
20:11
the earth
20:12
and the north pole is in the arctic not
20:15
the north orbit
20:16
not the north cover not the north period
20:19
that's weird but the north pole
20:21
the north pole is in the arctic where is
20:23
the south pole
20:25
the south pole is in the antarctic ant
20:28
are arctic yes if we can spell it right
20:32
oh yes we did okay arctic okay
20:35
you can see because arctic you just use
20:37
arctic here but antarctic
20:39
means the opposite antarctic okay so
20:42
arctic
20:42
antarctic okay well that wraps it up for
20:46
the
20:46
vocabulary section next we're going to
20:49
use those words in the reading passage
20:51
so stay tuned don't go away
21:11
[Music]
21:12
you
