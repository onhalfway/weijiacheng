hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading i'm brian stewart
and we're looking at science book number
three
lesson nine okay
how's the weather there are you having a
good day
well that's what this lesson is about
lesson nine is about
parts of weather did you know weather
has different parts
well in this unit we will discover about
the different parts
of the weather and we will also learn
what we use to measure
the weather okay so let's get started
as usual we will start with the
vocabulary
now there are many words that are
related to weather because weather is
very important for our lives
one interesting word about weather is
hail
have you seen hail before sometimes hail
doesn't happen
in certain parts of the world but if you
live in some
colder parts of the world you might see
hail what is hail hail is small
hard balls of ice that
fall from the sky like rain
now i say small but sometimes
in some places hail can be bigger
it can be big and it can be dangerous
right
in some places in america i remember
seeing news reports
of big pieces of ice falling down now
that can be dangerous and it can
damage usually it damages cars or homes
i don't remember and i hope it never
happens that somebody is hurt
or injured or killed by hail but it's
possible so you got to be careful
but hail is just ice falling from the
sky
right so it's kind of crazy when you see
hail actually we have a video
showing hail and this is this is not a
really
strong hail these are small pieces of
ice and you can't really see them in the
air because you know it's kind of a
white sky so it's hard to see the hail
but you can see it bouncing on the
ground as it lands
and there and this is small hail this is
not a big deal this is not dangerous
but if hail gets big it can be dangerous
and usually people the weather
forecasters will say
be careful there's a warning for hail
and as soon as it starts hitting people
run inside right
so yeah be careful but i don't mean to
scare you hail is not that common
and it's not really dangerous but it's
really strange to see sometimes when it
does happen
it is it is interesting to see okay
precipitation wow what a big word pre
shun one two three four five
five syllables precipitation
precipitation precipitation is
water that falls from the clouds to the
ground
and guess what the word we just learned
hail
it's ice that's frozen water so a hail
is a type of precipitation now usually
we when we talk about precipitation
we're talking about
rain but when it's winter time
the rain of course is liquid water in
the winter
the water freezes and you know it could
come down as hail but usually it comes
down
as snow so there are
many different types of precipitation
it's just water that falls from the
clouds to the ground
okay so good yeah precipitation big word
but it covers many different types
okay good arraign
gauge now a gauge is a instrument
that measures something usually how much
or how many of something there is
in this case a rain gauge is an
instrument for measuring how much
how much rain falls so you know weather
forecasters people who talk about the
weather they need
numbers right they need to know exactly
how much
so they might say okay tomorrow we
expect
two inches of rain that's a lot of rain
right
so how do they measure that well they
have a rain gauge
that tells them how much water will fall
during a certain time and in a certain
area so they measure that
and they say okay we expect you know
three centimeters of rain tomorrow for
example
okay so a rain gauge remember a gauge
there are many kinds of gauges not just
a rain gauge
there's a speed gauge in your car tells
you how fast you're going
it's called a speedometer not a speed
gauge it's called a speedometer but it
is a gauge
a gauge is any instrument that tells you
the
quantity how much or how many of
something there is
okay good next thermometer now a
thermometer
is another type of gauge right
it tells us how hot it is
what is the temperature what degree how
many degrees
uh is the air outside right
is the is it hot a lot of degrees or is
it cold very few degrees
how many right or how much thermometer a
thermometer is a device
a gauge used to measure temperature
so of course we have thermometers uh all
over the world there's
two types of thermometers in use in use
in the world of course most of the world
uses a thermometer in celsius
americans for some reason still use the
old
fair and height did i spell that right i
think so
height i think it's height sorry
nope that's wrong height
americans still use fahrenheit why
they're old-fashioned the rest of the
world uses celsius
when i came to korea i had to get used
to celsius because i was used to
fahrenheit
and so you know i was used to oh it's 78
degrees out that's great but
my korean friend would say 78 degrees
that's crazy right you can't live in 78
degrees
that's celsius right 78 degrees
fahrenheit it's a very nice day
very very great day you know 80 degrees
fahrenheit you know
that's a nice day but 80 degrees celsius
yeah you don't want to be there
okay so anyway thermometer thermometer
is the device used to measure
temperature okay good next okay our next
word is
weather vein a weather vein is another
instrument that weather people use
to talk about the weather and a weather
vane basically
tells people which direction the wind
is blowing if you look at the picture
here it's kind of interesting right
because we see north south east
and west so if we look at the weather
vane
and these are usually on the tops of
tall buildings right
it's made of metal it's a metal object
that blows around
blows around means it moves it moves
around and it can move
you know 360 degrees to show
which way the wind is coming from
so in this picture we can see the wind
makes the the weather vein move in a
certain way
and it points to the direction that the
weather is coming from
so it looks like here the weather is
well the weather is blowing in the
direction of
looks like east maybe a little bit north
okay so it's coming from the south or
it's coming from the west
maybe a little bit south that's that
tells you which direction the wind is
coming from
this is important to weather people
people who predict the weather
because you know they they study weather
patterns
okay and it's also important for farmers
because they need to know
you know which way the weather wind is
blowing that might help them
plan for their for the weather in the
next few days
okay next we have meteorologist
a meteorologist uh ologist if you ever
see this
ending that means someone who studies
something
someone who
studies
something so for example i think i said
before my dad
something my dad uh in his career he was
a geologist
geo means earth so geologist
is someone who studies the earth so what
is a meteorologist
a meteorologist is someone who studies
meteors right
no i'm sorry that's that's not true
meteors of course are like halley's
comet
or you know those objects that that come
around that
well those are comets but meteors are
are those things that fall to earth
now meteorologists don't study those
things it's an interesting word
you know why does meteorologists mean
weather person right someone who studies
the weather
well that's you know that's uh where it
that's what it means that's you know it
has an interesting history to it
but anyway an ologist is someone who
studies something they don't study
meteors they study the weather okay
so yeah be careful with that word but
usually geologist
studies earth bio means life
so a biologist is someone who studies
life
okay so interesting so but this one is a
bit weird it's not
weatherologist it's meteorologist okay
so be careful with that word so it's a
scientist
who studies weather conditions and
usually
a meteorologist meteorologists are
important because
they can predict the weather and when
you watch the news
probably a meteorologist comes on and
explains what the weather will be like
tomorrow the next day next week it's
hard to predict two weeks in the future
but they they try to
and but usually it's impo it's an
important obviously important job
because we need to know whether it's
going to rain whether it's going to snow
if there's a flood coming if there's a
hurricane coming
so we need to know these things and
that's what meteorologists
do okay and those are our words for this
lesson
now one of the ideas in this lesson is
parts of
weather what are the different parts of
weather
interesting idea right well first of all
as we saw from the vocabulary
we have precipitation and as i said
before
it can fall as rain hail
or snow precipitation remember is just
water
falling from the sky okay as a natural
process
of evaporation and condensation right
the water evaporates goes up into the
cool air
condenses gathers together and then
falls down
as rain hail or snow that's
precipitation
another part of temperature that
meteorologists will talk about
is temperature and of course when we
talk about temperatures say
oh what's the weather like what is the
weather like or
how is the weather right don't say how
is the weather like that is not correct
what is the weather like or how is the
weather
okay good so it can be warm it can be
hot
right 80 degrees celsius is crazy hot
okay usually if it gets up 30 degrees 35
degrees celsius oh
too hot too hot okay and 40 degrees
celsius i've seen 40 degrees celsius
i've never been in 40 degrees celsius
but i've seen it on the news right when
you watch like cnn weather
report 40 degrees in dubai oh
so hot right that's really hot okay so
i've never been in that thank goodness
okay so any warm hot
cool or cold right cold uh
temperatures again that's the other
extreme okay so that's temperature
now wind of course is another part of
the weather
and wind can be slow
gentle it can be refreshing or it can be
strong
and furious right like a hurricane so
wind is very important part of the
weather it moves from
warm areas wind moves from a warm area
to a cool area right warm area is a high
pressure right
warm of course makes things expand so it
creates pressure and a cool area things
are
that if the temperature temperature's
cool things tend to contract so if you
have hot
area next to a cool area the hot area
wants to
invade the cool area so wind of course
if it's hot air and cold air the hot air
wants to invade the coal area because
it's under pressure
so that creates wind as the wind as the
air moves that creates wind
so it moves from warm areas to cool
areas and
warm air has a lot of moisture in it
right as the temperature rises
more water evaporates and gets into the
air right
so when the warm air comes into the cool
air
the it carries the air and the water
with it and what happens
to the water when it comes into a cool
area it gathers together again it
condenses and then it falls down as rain
and that's why a lot of weather people
meteorologists will talk about warm
areas
cool areas high pressure zone low
pressure zone
because they're talking about which
direction the wind is moving in
which direction the weather is moving in
and possibly bringing rain
hail or snow with it okay that's maybe a
little too complicated but anyway
those are the parts of the weather okay
next
weather instruments of course we saw in
the vocabulary we saw
there are many instruments for
measuring the weather okay first we have
a rain gauge and remember there are many
types of gauges
a rain gauge just measures the depth
how much right you can measure it how
deep is it is it one centimeter
two centimeters three centers how deep
is the water
that fell from the sky that is a rain
gauge
used to measure the depth of the
precipitation
a thermometer of course is used to
measure the temperature of the air
when you want to know how hot it is
whether it's in fahrenheit or celsius
you look at a temperature uh you look at
a thermometer
and that will tell you what the
temperature is okay
whichever in this thermometer of course
has the two
uh systems it has celsius on the left
side
and it has fahrenheit on the right side
okay yeah interesting okay
it's used to measure the temperature of
the air next we talked about weather
vein
remember a weather vein shows which way
the wind is blowing and the top part
will move
not the bottom part right the bottom
part moved
we have no idea which way the wind is
moving so the bottom part is
fixed right that doesn't move the top
part
moves around okay i should have made
that clear before
but of course the bottom part doesn't
move it's fixed north is always north
right but the top part will move and
then you can see
which way the wind is blowing okay good
the next picture shows a wind gauge ah
we have gauge again remember
gauge is a type of instrument that
measures uh the quantity of something
and a wind gauge
will measure the quantity of the wind
the quantity of the speed
of the wind so measure the wind's speed
how fast
is it going it's like remember in your
car i told you about a speedometer
how fast is your car moving but this
instrument tells you
how fast the wind is moving okay so
gauge
there are many types of gauges okay good
okay the reading passage is about parts
of the weather and we're taking a look
at
meteorologists remember meteorologists
they don't study meteors
they study the weather okay so be
careful with that word okay
a meteorologist meteorologist
a little bit difficult to pronounce
right meteorologist
a meteorologist is a scientist
who studies the weather meteorologists
get information about the weather
they can predict what the weather will
be
like later on later on
in the future like i said maybe tomorrow
the day after tomorrow next week but
two weeks from now that's a little
difficult okay so
but later on means tomorrow the next day
or next week
okay moving on precipitation
lots of big words precipitation
is part of the weather it can fall as
rain
hail or snow a rain
gauge is used to measure the amount of
rain
that falls in one spot
the temperature is an important part
of the weather a thermometer
another big word a thermometer
measures temperature when it is
warm precipitation will fall
as rain when it is cold
precipitation might fall as hail
or snow okay
wind is another important part of the
weather
air moves from warm areas to cool areas
wind is moving air
wind can carry moisture into or away
from an area
wind can also change the temperature of
the air
in an area a weather vane
shows which direction the wind
is blowing right so yeah okay just to
summarize here of course
not to summarize but this last part i
just want to make a point
wind can also change the temperature of
the air in an area
that's very true isn't it if it's hot
during the summertime your sweating is
really humid
wouldn't it be great if you had a nice
wind blowing through it cools everything
down
that's why we use fans right fans blow
the air it creates wind for us
to carry that moisture away from our
bodies and cool us down a little bit
so it doesn't always work but hopefully
it works okay good
and then a weather vein shows which
direction the wind is blowing
okay so that's our reading passage next
we're going to take a look at how this
information
is organized okay we're looking at the
organization of the reading passage and
as we can see we have
classify as our reading skill classify
means
to put things into different categories
and this is a very good reading passage
for that type of organization because we
can see there are different kinds of
weather
instruments right and in the reading
passage they talked about different
kinds of
instruments that meteorologists use
to measure different parts of the
weather
so what are the different instruments we
can there are three main
instruments and we can classify them
right so the first instrument
is a rain gauge and we talked about rain
gauges right
so what does a rain gauge do well first
we have a blank a is a blank so it
starts a sentence with a blank
beep can fall as rain hail or snow
so what can fall as rain hailers snow
what
one word do we use to describe rain hail
and snow do you remember that word it's
a long word has
five syllables it's of course
precipitation
precipitation precipitation it can fall
as rain hail or snow
precipitation is just water that falls
from the sky
so a rain gauge is used to measure the
amount
of what well of course the amount of
rain
or water rain or you could even put
precipitation right
a rain gauge is used to measure the
amount of precipitation
or rain it doesn't measure the amount of
snow or hail
right it measures the amount of rain
okay good thermometer
of the thermometer what does it do the
beep of the air is an important part of
the weather what do we talk about
the thermometer measures well
temperature right here it's the next
sentence right
so that's actually what we have here
temperature tem per don't pronounce it
like that
temperature i sometimes when you have a
big word
you can over pronounce the syllables
like tempur
achur but don't say temperature say
temperature
okay just for spelling you can you can
you know
think about it temp uh chore ah that's
how you spell it
but when you say it temperature
temperature
okay good the temperature of the air is
an important part of the weather a
thermometer measures temperature
okay so yeah a lot of these things go
side by side
okay weather vein is our third
instrument
weather instrument what does a weather
vein do well the weather vein
shows the direction the what is blowing
right when air moves we call that
wind so shows us which direction
the wind is blowing and the wind
blows okay so you can say which way is
the wind
blowing we you could say which way is
the wind moving
yeah yeah that's possible but it's much
much more common to say
which way is the wind blowing or the
wind is blowing
strong today the wind is blowing
fiercely today or the wind is blowing
gently today so the wind blows
okay so that is our lesson for today
interesting weather of course is a very
important part of our lives
it helps us plan our days what are we
going to do right if it's a sunny warm
day
let's go out and have fun if it's a cold
snowy day
well you could go outside and have fun
too go skiing but if it's raining
probably want to stay inside maybe play
a game or
or do something else okay so
that's the different parts of the
weather i hope you learned a lot from
this lesson and of course some very
interesting words and vocabulary
that we picked up when talking about the
weather
thanks for studying with me i hope to
see in the next one take care everybody
bye bye

hello everybody
00:09
welcome back to american textbook
00:11
reading i'm brian stewart
00:13
and we're looking at science book number
00:15
three
00:16
lesson nine okay
00:19
how's the weather there are you having a
00:22
good day
00:23
well that's what this lesson is about
00:25
lesson nine is about
00:26
parts of weather did you know weather
00:29
has different parts
00:31
well in this unit we will discover about
00:33
the different parts
00:34
of the weather and we will also learn
00:38
what we use to measure
00:41
the weather okay so let's get started
00:45
as usual we will start with the
00:48
vocabulary
00:49
now there are many words that are
00:51
related to weather because weather is
00:53
very important for our lives
00:55
one interesting word about weather is
00:58
hail
00:59
have you seen hail before sometimes hail
01:03
doesn't happen
01:04
in certain parts of the world but if you
01:06
live in some
01:07
colder parts of the world you might see
01:10
hail what is hail hail is small
01:14
hard balls of ice that
01:17
fall from the sky like rain
01:20
now i say small but sometimes
01:24
in some places hail can be bigger
01:28
it can be big and it can be dangerous
01:30
right
01:31
in some places in america i remember
01:33
seeing news reports
01:35
of big pieces of ice falling down now
01:38
that can be dangerous and it can
01:40
damage usually it damages cars or homes
01:43
i don't remember and i hope it never
01:45
happens that somebody is hurt
01:47
or injured or killed by hail but it's
01:49
possible so you got to be careful
01:51
but hail is just ice falling from the
01:53
sky
01:54
right so it's kind of crazy when you see
01:56
hail actually we have a video
01:58
showing hail and this is this is not a
02:01
really
02:02
strong hail these are small pieces of
02:04
ice and you can't really see them in the
02:06
air because you know it's kind of a
02:08
white sky so it's hard to see the hail
02:10
but you can see it bouncing on the
02:12
ground as it lands
02:13
and there and this is small hail this is
02:15
not a big deal this is not dangerous
02:17
but if hail gets big it can be dangerous
02:20
and usually people the weather
02:22
forecasters will say
02:23
be careful there's a warning for hail
02:26
and as soon as it starts hitting people
02:28
run inside right
02:30
so yeah be careful but i don't mean to
02:31
scare you hail is not that common
02:34
and it's not really dangerous but it's
02:36
really strange to see sometimes when it
02:38
does happen
02:39
it is it is interesting to see okay
02:43
precipitation wow what a big word pre
02:48
shun one two three four five
02:52
five syllables precipitation
02:56
precipitation precipitation is
02:59
water that falls from the clouds to the
03:02
ground
03:03
and guess what the word we just learned
03:05
hail
03:06
it's ice that's frozen water so a hail
03:10
is a type of precipitation now usually
03:14
we when we talk about precipitation
03:16
we're talking about
03:18
rain but when it's winter time
03:21
the rain of course is liquid water in
03:23
the winter
03:24
the water freezes and you know it could
03:27
come down as hail but usually it comes
03:29
down
03:29
as snow so there are
03:33
many different types of precipitation
03:37
it's just water that falls from the
03:39
clouds to the ground
03:41
okay so good yeah precipitation big word
03:43
but it covers many different types
03:47
okay good arraign
03:50
gauge now a gauge is a instrument
03:54
that measures something usually how much
03:57
or how many of something there is
04:01
in this case a rain gauge is an
04:03
instrument for measuring how much
04:06
how much rain falls so you know weather
04:09
forecasters people who talk about the
04:11
weather they need
04:12
numbers right they need to know exactly
04:15
how much
04:16
so they might say okay tomorrow we
04:18
expect
04:19
two inches of rain that's a lot of rain
04:22
right
04:23
so how do they measure that well they
04:25
have a rain gauge
04:27
that tells them how much water will fall
04:30
during a certain time and in a certain
04:33
area so they measure that
04:35
and they say okay we expect you know
04:38
three centimeters of rain tomorrow for
04:40
example
04:41
okay so a rain gauge remember a gauge
04:43
there are many kinds of gauges not just
04:45
a rain gauge
04:46
there's a speed gauge in your car tells
04:48
you how fast you're going
04:50
it's called a speedometer not a speed
04:53
gauge it's called a speedometer but it
04:54
is a gauge
04:55
a gauge is any instrument that tells you
04:58
the
04:58
quantity how much or how many of
05:02
something there is
05:03
okay good next thermometer now a
05:06
thermometer
05:07
is another type of gauge right
05:10
it tells us how hot it is
05:13
what is the temperature what degree how
05:15
many degrees
05:17
uh is the air outside right
05:20
is the is it hot a lot of degrees or is
05:23
it cold very few degrees
05:25
how many right or how much thermometer a
05:28
thermometer is a device
05:30
a gauge used to measure temperature
05:34
so of course we have thermometers uh all
05:38
over the world there's
05:39
two types of thermometers in use in use
05:41
in the world of course most of the world
05:43
uses a thermometer in celsius
05:47
americans for some reason still use the
05:50
old
05:51
fair and height did i spell that right i
05:54
think so
05:56
height i think it's height sorry
05:59
nope that's wrong height
06:03
americans still use fahrenheit why
06:07
they're old-fashioned the rest of the
06:09
world uses celsius
06:10
when i came to korea i had to get used
06:12
to celsius because i was used to
06:14
fahrenheit
06:14
and so you know i was used to oh it's 78
06:18
degrees out that's great but
06:20
my korean friend would say 78 degrees
06:22
that's crazy right you can't live in 78
06:24
degrees
06:24
that's celsius right 78 degrees
06:26
fahrenheit it's a very nice day
06:28
very very great day you know 80 degrees
06:30
fahrenheit you know
06:31
that's a nice day but 80 degrees celsius
06:34
yeah you don't want to be there
06:35
okay so anyway thermometer thermometer
06:38
is the device used to measure
06:39
temperature okay good next okay our next
06:42
word is
06:43
weather vein a weather vein is another
06:46
instrument that weather people use
06:48
to talk about the weather and a weather
06:50
vane basically
06:51
tells people which direction the wind
06:54
is blowing if you look at the picture
06:56
here it's kind of interesting right
06:58
because we see north south east
07:01
and west so if we look at the weather
07:04
vane
07:05
and these are usually on the tops of
07:06
tall buildings right
07:08
it's made of metal it's a metal object
07:10
that blows around
07:12
blows around means it moves it moves
07:15
around and it can move
07:16
you know 360 degrees to show
07:19
which way the wind is coming from
07:22
so in this picture we can see the wind
07:25
makes the the weather vein move in a
07:28
certain way
07:29
and it points to the direction that the
07:31
weather is coming from
07:32
so it looks like here the weather is
07:35
well the weather is blowing in the
07:36
direction of
07:37
looks like east maybe a little bit north
07:39
okay so it's coming from the south or
07:42
it's coming from the west
07:43
maybe a little bit south that's that
07:46
tells you which direction the wind is
07:47
coming from
07:48
this is important to weather people
07:50
people who predict the weather
07:52
because you know they they study weather
07:54
patterns
07:55
okay and it's also important for farmers
07:58
because they need to know
07:59
you know which way the weather wind is
08:01
blowing that might help them
08:03
plan for their for the weather in the
08:06
next few days
08:07
okay next we have meteorologist
08:10
a meteorologist uh ologist if you ever
08:13
see this
08:14
ending that means someone who studies
08:16
something
08:17
someone who
08:21
studies
08:25
something so for example i think i said
08:28
before my dad
08:30
something my dad uh in his career he was
08:33
a geologist
08:35
geo means earth so geologist
08:38
is someone who studies the earth so what
08:41
is a meteorologist
08:43
a meteorologist is someone who studies
08:45
meteors right
08:47
no i'm sorry that's that's not true
08:50
meteors of course are like halley's
08:51
comet
08:52
or you know those objects that that come
08:54
around that
08:55
well those are comets but meteors are
08:58
are those things that fall to earth
09:00
now meteorologists don't study those
09:02
things it's an interesting word
09:04
you know why does meteorologists mean
09:06
weather person right someone who studies
09:09
the weather
09:09
well that's you know that's uh where it
09:13
that's what it means that's you know it
09:14
has an interesting history to it
09:16
but anyway an ologist is someone who
09:18
studies something they don't study
09:19
meteors they study the weather okay
09:22
so yeah be careful with that word but
09:23
usually geologist
09:25
studies earth bio means life
09:29
so a biologist is someone who studies
09:32
life
09:32
okay so interesting so but this one is a
09:35
bit weird it's not
09:36
weatherologist it's meteorologist okay
09:39
so be careful with that word so it's a
09:41
scientist
09:41
who studies weather conditions and
09:44
usually
09:45
a meteorologist meteorologists are
09:47
important because
09:49
they can predict the weather and when
09:51
you watch the news
09:53
probably a meteorologist comes on and
09:55
explains what the weather will be like
09:58
tomorrow the next day next week it's
10:01
hard to predict two weeks in the future
10:03
but they they try to
10:05
and but usually it's impo it's an
10:06
important obviously important job
10:08
because we need to know whether it's
10:10
going to rain whether it's going to snow
10:12
if there's a flood coming if there's a
10:14
hurricane coming
10:15
so we need to know these things and
10:17
that's what meteorologists
10:18
do okay and those are our words for this
10:21
lesson
10:24
now one of the ideas in this lesson is
10:27
parts of
10:28
weather what are the different parts of
10:30
weather
10:31
interesting idea right well first of all
10:33
as we saw from the vocabulary
10:35
we have precipitation and as i said
10:38
before
10:39
it can fall as rain hail
10:42
or snow precipitation remember is just
10:45
water
10:46
falling from the sky okay as a natural
10:48
process
10:50
of evaporation and condensation right
10:53
the water evaporates goes up into the
10:55
cool air
10:56
condenses gathers together and then
10:58
falls down
10:59
as rain hail or snow that's
11:02
precipitation
11:04
another part of temperature that
11:06
meteorologists will talk about
11:08
is temperature and of course when we
11:10
talk about temperatures say
11:12
oh what's the weather like what is the
11:14
weather like or
11:15
how is the weather right don't say how
11:18
is the weather like that is not correct
11:20
what is the weather like or how is the
11:23
weather
11:24
okay good so it can be warm it can be
11:26
hot
11:27
right 80 degrees celsius is crazy hot
11:32
okay usually if it gets up 30 degrees 35
11:35
degrees celsius oh
11:36
too hot too hot okay and 40 degrees
11:39
celsius i've seen 40 degrees celsius
11:41
i've never been in 40 degrees celsius
11:44
but i've seen it on the news right when
11:46
you watch like cnn weather
11:47
report 40 degrees in dubai oh
11:51
so hot right that's really hot okay so
11:54
i've never been in that thank goodness
11:56
okay so any warm hot
11:57
cool or cold right cold uh
12:01
temperatures again that's the other
12:03
extreme okay so that's temperature
12:04
now wind of course is another part of
12:07
the weather
12:07
and wind can be slow
12:11
gentle it can be refreshing or it can be
12:14
strong
12:15
and furious right like a hurricane so
12:18
wind is very important part of the
12:20
weather it moves from
12:22
warm areas wind moves from a warm area
12:25
to a cool area right warm area is a high
12:28
pressure right
12:29
warm of course makes things expand so it
12:32
creates pressure and a cool area things
12:35
are
12:36
that if the temperature temperature's
12:37
cool things tend to contract so if you
12:39
have hot
12:40
area next to a cool area the hot area
12:42
wants to
12:43
invade the cool area so wind of course
12:47
if it's hot air and cold air the hot air
12:50
wants to invade the coal area because
12:51
it's under pressure
12:53
so that creates wind as the wind as the
12:55
air moves that creates wind
12:57
so it moves from warm areas to cool
12:59
areas and
13:00
warm air has a lot of moisture in it
13:02
right as the temperature rises
13:04
more water evaporates and gets into the
13:07
air right
13:08
so when the warm air comes into the cool
13:11
air
13:11
the it carries the air and the water
13:14
with it and what happens
13:15
to the water when it comes into a cool
13:17
area it gathers together again it
13:19
condenses and then it falls down as rain
13:21
and that's why a lot of weather people
13:24
meteorologists will talk about warm
13:28
areas
13:28
cool areas high pressure zone low
13:31
pressure zone
13:31
because they're talking about which
13:33
direction the wind is moving in
13:35
which direction the weather is moving in
13:37
and possibly bringing rain
13:39
hail or snow with it okay that's maybe a
13:41
little too complicated but anyway
13:43
those are the parts of the weather okay
13:46
next
13:47
weather instruments of course we saw in
13:48
the vocabulary we saw
13:50
there are many instruments for
13:54
measuring the weather okay first we have
13:57
a rain gauge and remember there are many
13:59
types of gauges
14:01
a rain gauge just measures the depth
14:04
how much right you can measure it how
14:06
deep is it is it one centimeter
14:08
two centimeters three centers how deep
14:10
is the water
14:11
that fell from the sky that is a rain
14:14
gauge
14:15
used to measure the depth of the
14:17
precipitation
14:19
a thermometer of course is used to
14:21
measure the temperature of the air
14:23
when you want to know how hot it is
14:26
whether it's in fahrenheit or celsius
14:28
you look at a temperature uh you look at
14:30
a thermometer
14:32
and that will tell you what the
14:33
temperature is okay
14:35
whichever in this thermometer of course
14:37
has the two
14:38
uh systems it has celsius on the left
14:41
side
14:41
and it has fahrenheit on the right side
14:44
okay yeah interesting okay
14:47
it's used to measure the temperature of
14:49
the air next we talked about weather
14:52
vein
14:52
remember a weather vein shows which way
14:56
the wind is blowing and the top part
14:58
will move
14:59
not the bottom part right the bottom
15:01
part moved
15:02
we have no idea which way the wind is
15:04
moving so the bottom part is
15:06
fixed right that doesn't move the top
15:09
part
15:10
moves around okay i should have made
15:12
that clear before
15:13
but of course the bottom part doesn't
15:14
move it's fixed north is always north
15:17
right but the top part will move and
15:19
then you can see
15:20
which way the wind is blowing okay good
15:24
the next picture shows a wind gauge ah
15:26
we have gauge again remember
15:28
gauge is a type of instrument that
15:31
measures uh the quantity of something
15:34
and a wind gauge
15:35
will measure the quantity of the wind
15:38
the quantity of the speed
15:40
of the wind so measure the wind's speed
15:42
how fast
15:43
is it going it's like remember in your
15:45
car i told you about a speedometer
15:47
how fast is your car moving but this
15:50
instrument tells you
15:50
how fast the wind is moving okay so
15:53
gauge
15:54
there are many types of gauges okay good
15:59
okay the reading passage is about parts
16:01
of the weather and we're taking a look
16:03
at
16:03
meteorologists remember meteorologists
16:05
they don't study meteors
16:07
they study the weather okay so be
16:09
careful with that word okay
16:10
a meteorologist meteorologist
16:13
a little bit difficult to pronounce
16:15
right meteorologist
16:17
a meteorologist is a scientist
16:21
who studies the weather meteorologists
16:25
get information about the weather
16:28
they can predict what the weather will
16:31
be
16:31
like later on later on
16:34
in the future like i said maybe tomorrow
16:38
the day after tomorrow next week but
16:41
two weeks from now that's a little
16:43
difficult okay so
16:44
but later on means tomorrow the next day
16:46
or next week
16:48
okay moving on precipitation
16:52
lots of big words precipitation
16:55
is part of the weather it can fall as
16:58
rain
16:59
hail or snow a rain
17:02
gauge is used to measure the amount of
17:06
rain
17:06
that falls in one spot
17:11
the temperature is an important part
17:14
of the weather a thermometer
17:18
another big word a thermometer
17:22
measures temperature when it is
17:25
warm precipitation will fall
17:28
as rain when it is cold
17:32
precipitation might fall as hail
17:36
or snow okay
17:40
wind is another important part of the
17:43
weather
17:44
air moves from warm areas to cool areas
17:49
wind is moving air
17:53
wind can carry moisture into or away
17:57
from an area
18:00
wind can also change the temperature of
18:04
the air
18:05
in an area a weather vane
18:09
shows which direction the wind
18:12
is blowing right so yeah okay just to
18:15
summarize here of course
18:16
not to summarize but this last part i
18:18
just want to make a point
18:19
wind can also change the temperature of
18:22
the air in an area
18:24
that's very true isn't it if it's hot
18:26
during the summertime your sweating is
18:28
really humid
18:29
wouldn't it be great if you had a nice
18:31
wind blowing through it cools everything
18:33
down
18:34
that's why we use fans right fans blow
18:37
the air it creates wind for us
18:39
to carry that moisture away from our
18:41
bodies and cool us down a little bit
18:43
so it doesn't always work but hopefully
18:46
it works okay good
18:47
and then a weather vein shows which
18:49
direction the wind is blowing
18:51
okay so that's our reading passage next
18:53
we're going to take a look at how this
18:54
information
18:55
is organized okay we're looking at the
18:59
organization of the reading passage and
19:01
as we can see we have
19:03
classify as our reading skill classify
19:06
means
19:06
to put things into different categories
19:08
and this is a very good reading passage
19:11
for that type of organization because we
19:13
can see there are different kinds of
19:15
weather
19:16
instruments right and in the reading
19:18
passage they talked about different
19:20
kinds of
19:21
instruments that meteorologists use
19:24
to measure different parts of the
19:27
weather
19:27
so what are the different instruments we
19:30
can there are three main
19:31
instruments and we can classify them
19:33
right so the first instrument
19:35
is a rain gauge and we talked about rain
19:38
gauges right
19:39
so what does a rain gauge do well first
19:41
we have a blank a is a blank so it
19:42
starts a sentence with a blank
19:44
beep can fall as rain hail or snow
19:48
so what can fall as rain hailers snow
19:51
what
19:52
one word do we use to describe rain hail
19:55
and snow do you remember that word it's
19:57
a long word has
19:59
five syllables it's of course
20:02
precipitation
20:12
precipitation precipitation it can fall
20:15
as rain hail or snow
20:16
precipitation is just water that falls
20:18
from the sky
20:20
so a rain gauge is used to measure the
20:23
amount
20:24
of what well of course the amount of
20:27
rain
20:28
or water rain or you could even put
20:31
precipitation right
20:32
a rain gauge is used to measure the
20:34
amount of precipitation
20:36
or rain it doesn't measure the amount of
20:39
snow or hail
20:40
right it measures the amount of rain
20:43
okay good thermometer
20:47
of the thermometer what does it do the
20:49
beep of the air is an important part of
20:51
the weather what do we talk about
20:53
the thermometer measures well
20:54
temperature right here it's the next
20:56
sentence right
20:57
so that's actually what we have here
21:00
temperature tem per don't pronounce it
21:04
like that
21:04
temperature i sometimes when you have a
21:07
big word
21:08
you can over pronounce the syllables
21:10
like tempur
21:11
achur but don't say temperature say
21:15
temperature
21:16
okay just for spelling you can you can
21:19
you know
21:19
think about it temp uh chore ah that's
21:22
how you spell it
21:23
but when you say it temperature
21:25
temperature
21:26
okay good the temperature of the air is
21:28
an important part of the weather a
21:29
thermometer measures temperature
21:31
okay so yeah a lot of these things go
21:34
side by side
21:35
okay weather vein is our third
21:37
instrument
21:38
weather instrument what does a weather
21:40
vein do well the weather vein
21:42
shows the direction the what is blowing
21:45
right when air moves we call that
21:48
wind so shows us which direction
21:52
the wind is blowing and the wind
21:55
blows okay so you can say which way is
21:59
the wind
21:59
blowing we you could say which way is
22:01
the wind moving
22:02
yeah yeah that's possible but it's much
22:05
much more common to say
22:06
which way is the wind blowing or the
22:09
wind is blowing
22:10
strong today the wind is blowing
22:14
fiercely today or the wind is blowing
22:17
gently today so the wind blows
22:20
okay so that is our lesson for today
22:23
interesting weather of course is a very
22:25
important part of our lives
22:26
it helps us plan our days what are we
22:28
going to do right if it's a sunny warm
22:30
day
22:31
let's go out and have fun if it's a cold
22:34
snowy day
22:35
well you could go outside and have fun
22:37
too go skiing but if it's raining
22:39
probably want to stay inside maybe play
22:41
a game or
22:42
or do something else okay so
22:45
that's the different parts of the
22:46
weather i hope you learned a lot from
22:48
this lesson and of course some very
22:50
interesting words and vocabulary
22:51
that we picked up when talking about the
22:54
weather
22:54
thanks for studying with me i hope to
22:56
see in the next one take care everybody
22:58
bye bye
