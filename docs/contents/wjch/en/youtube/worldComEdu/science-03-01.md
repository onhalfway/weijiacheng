hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading series
i'm your host brian stewart today we're
taking a look
at science book 3 unit 1
and the topic for unit 1 is living
and non-living things in this unit
you will discover what living things
do and you will also discover
how living and non-living things
are different interesting unit
so let's get started with a list of the
vocabulary
okay so let's go over the vocabulary the
first word
is live as in
to live live to live
means to be alive to be in the process
of being
alive now be careful with live
because it can also be pronounced in
another way you can pronounce this
live but that has a different meaning
if you say live that is an adjective
right so live here this live
is a verb right to live
i want to live a long time
but live as an adjective
we can say it is a live concert
right that means that people are playing
it's not recorded music
people are actually playing the music
you can see
the people it's live music live
concert but live okay so be careful live
live okay in this case live
live means to be alive next word is to
grow
things that live
grow they grow during their lives
right they become bigger or taller over
a period of time
you are growing right now right
you can't see it right grow to grow
usually means
it takes a long time right it takes many
months maybe years for you to notice
a change as you grow but some animals
grow very quickly right
like pets dogs and cats they grow very
quickly you still hard to see you don't
see it
right happening right now but you know
over weeks or months
very quickly they change they grow they
become
bigger or taller our next word
is to change to change means to become
different that's a good picture
right you've all seen an egg right
sometimes you eat eggs for breakfast
right
well those are not eggs that will become
chickens don't worry
but they are but an egg that is
able to become a chicken will hatch
after a while right
the egg will change it'll break open and
a little chick will come out of it
that's a big change right to become
different you also change right when you
were a baby
now you were a child or a teenager
you changed right and you will continue
to change
through your life we all do okay
reproduce reproduce
reproduce reproduce means to make
more living things of the same kind
all living things are able to
reproduce that means that they can make
more
living things that look like them when
you get older you might get married and
have
children that means you will reproduce
right
when your dog gets older it can meet
another dog
become a parent and they will have
children right
plants when they get older they send out
seeds
or pollen and they will reproduce
and more plants will grow so to make
more living things
of the same kind that's to reproduce
next word is a sad word die
to no longer be alive here we have a sad
picture of a bird
probably an old bird who became too old
and then
died all living things become old
and die it's part of life the thing is
enjoy your life while you're live
while you while you are living right to
enjoy your life and be good to other
people that's the important thing
okay our next word is move to move
to move means to go from place a to
place b
right something is at place a and it
moves
over to place b now here we have a
picture of a snail
snails are famous for moving very slowly
somebody might say oh you move like a
snail
means you move very slowly
and probably not a good idea especially
if you're going to school
okay so actually we have a video of a
snail moving
and you can see i'll start the video
here you can see
okay the snail is moving but it's taking
a long time right very slow
in the background you saw the cars going
by very quickly
cars move fast be careful snails
move really slow
this snail's very slow okay we don't
have time to watch him
move it would take a long time to see a
move from one side to the other
we don't have time okay so next we have
breathe breathe
okay we have the e at the end that's
important i will
explain soon but
to breathe means to
take air into the body actually you take
it into your lungs
right and then you send it out again all
living things breathe now
animals and plants have different
ways to breathe but for animals right we
breathe in the air
the air goes into our lungs we take the
oxygen
out and it goes into our blood and this
gives us
energy we need the oxygen
to live so we breathe in the air
we don't need all of the air just a
little part of it is oxygen
but we take that oxygen and we
breathe out the breath the air that we
don't need or the
the gas that is coming out of our body
so it's important to think about
breathe in breathe out
so we can also say that you breathe in
and you breathe out okay
breathe in breathe out
breathe in breathe out and we do it all
the time we don't
even think about it because it's a
natural part
of living now i said it's important
the e at the end now there's a very
similar word
it's called it's it's spelled this way
and this is different so be careful
breath
breathe is a verb
it's the action right i i showed you
that's to breathe breath
is a noun okay so
be careful don't get those two words
confused we can say
take a breath
that is a breath breathe in and breathe
out
that is one breath okay so when you talk
about a breath
as a noun it's no e and we pronounce it
breath but if you're talking about the
action
that's a verb we put an e on the end and
we pronounce it breathe
okay so breath breathe
be careful don't get them mixed up okay
good
okay next we have a video
now fish can breathe how can fish
breathe they're under
water where do they get the air
well it's interesting because even in
water
there is gas water is hydrogen and
oxygen
and fish are designed to be able to
get the gas the oxygen that they need
through their
gills right they don't breathe in
through their mouth
they have gills on the side of their
bodies
and they are able to take in the gas
that they need
now if we can see you know we can see
the little fish moving around it's hard
to see their gills
you can see their mouths moving but
they're not really breathing through
their mouth
they're breathing through their gills
let me write that for you
gills and i put s because
a fish have two gills on either side
right
and they're kind of their neck and they
kind of open up and close
as they're swimming and that's where the
water passes through and they can catch
the air or the oxygen that they need
through their gills so fish obviously
are much different
than mammals because they breathe
differently and they can breathe
underwater
mammals can't breathe underwater whales
and dolphins are mammals
but they have to come up and they have a
hole in the back of their head that
opens up
and they take in the air and they
breathe through that hole
so mammals and whales are not really
fish they're
mammals but true fish have gills
okay interesting next we have oxygen and
i've said that word before
oxygen oxygen or oxygen
if you say it quickly sounds like oxygen
oxygen oxygen is very important
obviously
i just said when we breathe in we need
the oxygen
in the air the air around us
actually you know we it's kind of maybe
a bigger
lesson nitrogen and
oxygen the air right now
around me and around you uh is
21 only 21
oxygen the rest what is that that's 79
percent
nitrogen right so we don't need nitrogen
our bodies don't um
use nitrogen nitrogen is it's like
nothing to our body we don't react to
nitrogen
but we do react with oxygen and we need
oxygen to live oxygen goes into our
blood it helps us
uh do many of the the functions that our
cells
need uh to be able to to do what they
they do and there's so many different
cells that do have different tasks
in our body and that's that helps us to
live so oxygen is a gas right
it's a gas that living things need
we need it fish need it uh many
different living things
need uh oxygen and
mostly the air is 79 nitrogen
21 oxygen yes there are other gases but
they're very small
they're not really measurable uh in any
situation any typical situation
okay that we you know in the outside
okay good so oxygen
is very important for us and most living
things
next we have healthy healthy means to be
strong and well i hope
you are healthy and your parents are
very interested
or uh they're very worried uh hopefully
not too worried
that you stay healthy and you should
eat well eat good things eat vegetables
eat you know depending on you know
meat is good vegetables of course are
very important
make sure you eat a balanced diet so to
stay healthy
but that's not it you also need to
exercise this boy is
exercising because you need to give your
muscles
uh the practice or the chance to grow
strong and you want to stay healthy and
not just eating and exercise
you also need sleep so make sure you get
enough sleep
put your phone away don't play video
games too long
get enough sleep at night all of these
things
help you remain healthy and you want to
be healthy
all your life of course when you're
young you're very strong and healthy
as you get older you have to work harder
to be
to stay healthy okay good
okay now let's take a look
at the difference between living things
and non-living things so that's what
this unit is about really
living in non-living things how are they
different
well we've learned a lot of words in the
vocabulary section about living things
we learned
grow right living things grow they get
bigger and taller
so you can see the picture of the swan
and the little
baby swans the the
babies will grow they'll get taller they
will become adult swans
do non-living things grow well
oxygen is a non-living thing it's a gas
does it grow no it
you know it might we use it but
oxygen by itself it doesn't get bigger
it stays the same
right it doesn't have a process where it
gets bigger or taller
right it just stays the same okay next
living things change yeah they change of
course as they grow
they get bigger they get taller but some
living things
change as they uh
grow or as they become from a baby to a
child to an adult
they actually change form for example
butterflies
caterpillars they will change form
as they grow so they change and we saw
the example of the egg becoming
the chick they change but do non-living
things change
no they do not change right you see a
rock
that rock will always be the same it
doesn't change by itself
i mean yeah sure i can take a hammer and
break it and then it changes
but i had to do that or something else
had to do that
the rock by itself will not change by
itself
living things do change by themselves
okay next we have move
move from one place to another we saw
the snail
the snail takes a long time people move
more quickly
right and of course
birds move very fast and horses as we
can see in the picture
they move very quickly from one place to
another
but do non-living things move by
themselves
no they don't i mean you might have a
doll on your shelf in your bedroom
but if you put it there and you leave it
there it's not going to move
i hope no i'm just kidding no it won't
move don't worry
okay so you have to pick it up and put
it somewhere
and before in the snail video i said
look at the cars of course
people are making those cars move if you
park the car and leave it
the car is not going to move by itself
right
so non-living things do not move
by themselves okay next last we have
reproduce and we can see the mother and
the father
and the baby i don't know if it's a girl
or a boy
but it's a baby and they have a baby
mother and the father got together
they created a baby all living things
have the ability to reproduce
to make younger copies of themselves
they're not perfect copies they're a
little bit different we wouldn't
that would be very boring if everybody
was the same so it's very interesting
that they're a little bit different
but we have the ability to reproduce all
living things
do non-living things can they reproduce
no even though in the picture we see
many houses that look like they're the
same
right but those houses didn't reproduce
by themselves
no people construction workers
came and built those houses you know but
the houses don't get together and have
babies what's a baby house that's crazy
we don't if that doesn't happen
so non-living things do not
reproduce living things do so this chart
shows
us many differences between living
things
and non-living things what do living
things do
and living things do not do those things
okay interesting now when we take a look
at living things we can say that
all living things do these three things
in our chart first we can see that all
living things
grow the baby drinks milk from her
mother
so she can grow right when the mothers
have the baby
they will give milk to their babies
so the baby needs milk and after the
baby gets older
the baby doesn't need the milk anymore
but they still need to eat
we all need to eat i hope you eat well
during the day
and you eat healthy foods to stay
healthy
so if you do that you will grow
strong you will grow well okay that's
that's important obviously
so all living things grow the second
thing is
change right in the first picture we see
the baby but maybe
after a few years now we have a young
girl right so change the girl you know
before the girl is a baby right
she can't talk she'll say but that's not
talking really
right but when she gets older she can
say words she can make
sentences she can talk say what she's
thinking that's to talk she can walk by
ourselves babies don't walk they crawl
right and she can eat by herself mom
doesn't have to give her the food
right it goes down now the the child can
eat by herself
so the cha the the baby girl or the baby
girl
changed into a child you changed from a
baby to a child
or a teenager and later on you will
become an adult
you change throughout your life i've
done most of my
changing still have some change left in
me
but we all change everybody changes
reproduce reproduce is the third thing
and that of course is when uh you know
we can talk about this girl actually
let's imagine that this is the same
person in each of the picture
first we see the little baby right then
she grows a little bit older she's a
baby she changes into a child
many years later she becomes a woman and
look she has a baby
of her own right so she reproduced she
grew older she became
a woman and with a man she was able to
reproduce
so the woman has a baby of her own so
again all living things are able to
reproduce to make copies
of themselves not exact copies but
copies of themselves new living things
and that's life okay so living things
can do that
okay now it's time for the reading as
usual
read along with me maybe you can read
out loud as i read
or read along in your head and think
about the pronunciation of the words
and of course remember the vocabulary
that we learned
at the beginning of this unit are you
ready
let's begin in the world
there are living things and non-living
things
a living thing is something that
is alive
a chick is a living thing
a chick lives in a nest
it needs space to live in
a chick breathes air
air has oxygen in it
do you remember how much right usually
21 oxygen
okay okay air has oxygen
in it almost all living things
need oxygen to live
a chick needs to eat and
drink food and water
help keep the chick healthy
keep healthy also stay
healthy these are very common
expressions stay
healthy i hope you stay
healthy please keep healthy
okay don't say keep your health that's
strange just say
keep healthy or stay healthy okay next
it grows and changes into
a chicken right so a baby chick
will grow and change into
an adult chicken okay next
living things can reproduce
a chicken can make an egg a chick
comes from an egg
one day the chicken will die all living
things
die okay so living things reproduce
right
a chicken makes an egg chick comes from
the egg
and then the chick you know the chick is
born grows older
becomes an adult and it lays an egg too
so you know it goes around and around
and then after a while it will die all
living things
die
some things do not die because they have
never been alive they are called
non-living things
rocks are non-living things
they do not breathe or grow
rocks do not need to eat or
drink a rock does not
move by itself
non-living things cannot reproduce
okay so
that's interesting that passage
obviously we had two different things we
were talking about now
when you read about two different things
or you
you write about two different things
probably you want to say
how are they the same or
how are they different this passage
obviously was talking about two
different things
and they are different they're not the
same they're different one
thing first we saw and we read about
living things and we learned what living
things
do then in the middle of the passage we
changed we
switched we transitioned
right we had a transition
sorry a transition a transition
is when you change from one subject to
another
so in the middle of this of the
paragraph we had a
transition and we started talking about
non-living things so first we talked
about living things
then we transitioned into talking about
non-living things and we showed how they
are
different so this is contrast
not comparison contrast
okay so when your teacher says you know
compare
or contrast should you really be compare
or contrast
two different things uh you can compare
them or
you could compare and contrast that
would be a bit longer you can say how
they're the same
and then how they're different you could
also do that that's another
plan for your essay or for your writing
passage but anyway this was contrast so
on the left hand side we have living
things
on the right hand side we have
non-living things
how are they different how do they
contrast
contrast equals different right show
difference
so let's start with the left side at the
top
it says living things are
beep living things are what
well living things are uh it wasn't
it was similar to a vocabulary word it's
not exactly the same but in the reading
passage remember
it said living things are what do they
do they live if something
lives it is alive
right so living things are
alive living things are alive alive
we say it is alive because we say it
lives so to live is a verb
alive is an adjective right they are
alive right it is alive
okay good living things need food
water and peep
what else do they need well we talked
about food we talked about
water well in the vocabulary section we
talked about something
that living things need and to get it
right to get that thing we have to do
something
we have to breathe uh what are we
getting when we breathe
we are getting oxygen oxygen
oxygen
so living things need food water and
oxygen in order to continue living if
you don't get food
you die if you don't get water you die
if you don't get oxygen
you die so don't die get food get water
get oxygen
stay healthy okay good
so living things beep and change
now that kind of means the same thing
right but
uh they're a little bit different right
because they change how do they change
they get bigger and they get taller when
something gets
bigger and or taller what are they doing
what's the vocabulary word
grow that's right grow
so living things grow and change as they
grow of course
they change now living things can
beep what do living things
do that non-living things cannot do now
this
now there's a lot of choices we could
use for d
but we can just go over to the right
hand side and see ah
it's the opposite of what is on the
right hand side so we say living things
can breathe
well or living things can grow or living
things can reproduce
which one is it so let's look over
non-living things cannot make
new things like themselves aha make
new things like themselves what does
that mean
the vocabulary word was reproduce so we
want to show
the exact difference so we need to put
that here re-produce
oops i'm sorry reproduce u-c-e
okay let me write that again re-pro
okay a little weird with this pen okay
reproduce
so living things can reproduce those are
things that living things can do
they're opposite of the other thing of
the other
side non-living things so we said living
things are alive
non-living things are not alive okay
that would be the direct
opposite direct
opposite how are they different right
how how do you contrast them what is the
direct
opposite alive not alive
um living things need food water and
beep
oxygen we already have that but
non-living things do not need food water
or
oxygen of course we can just use the
same word because
do not need is the direct opposite of
need okay direct opposite so
living things grow and change non-living
things do not
grow or change grow
or change so do not is the opposite of
we don't need do here but actually you
know do is kind of what we
say implied we don't need it
we don't say it we don't say living
things do grow and change we don't need
to
but if you say it negatively then you
say do not
right living living non-living things do
not
grow or change okay that's the direct
opposite of what they do do
okay and then finally as we saw before
living things can reproduce non-living
things cannot make
new things like themselves that's the
same as saying reproduce
okay so basically this chart shows us
uh the difference the opposites
uh characteristics between living things
and non-living things you know
what do living things do what do
non-living things
not do right how are they different okay
so that was an interesting unit right we
talked about the differences between
living things and non-living things
and we focused on what do living things
do
and what non-living things don't
do okay so kind of an interesting lesson
well that's it for today i hope you
learned a lot as always
and we'll see you in the next unit or
the next lesson
take care everybody bye bye
you

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:11
textbook reading series
00:13
i'm your host brian stewart today we're
00:16
taking a look
00:17
at science book 3 unit 1
00:20
and the topic for unit 1 is living
00:24
and non-living things in this unit
00:28
you will discover what living things
00:31
do and you will also discover
00:34
how living and non-living things
00:38
are different interesting unit
00:42
so let's get started with a list of the
00:44
vocabulary
00:48
okay so let's go over the vocabulary the
00:50
first word
00:51
is live as in
00:54
to live live to live
00:58
means to be alive to be in the process
01:01
of being
01:02
alive now be careful with live
01:05
because it can also be pronounced in
01:08
another way you can pronounce this
01:11
live but that has a different meaning
01:14
if you say live that is an adjective
01:17
right so live here this live
01:20
is a verb right to live
01:24
i want to live a long time
01:27
but live as an adjective
01:32
we can say it is a live concert
01:36
right that means that people are playing
01:39
it's not recorded music
01:41
people are actually playing the music
01:43
you can see
01:44
the people it's live music live
01:47
concert but live okay so be careful live
01:51
live okay in this case live
01:55
live means to be alive next word is to
01:58
grow
02:00
things that live
02:03
grow they grow during their lives
02:06
right they become bigger or taller over
02:10
a period of time
02:11
you are growing right now right
02:15
you can't see it right grow to grow
02:18
usually means
02:19
it takes a long time right it takes many
02:22
months maybe years for you to notice
02:26
a change as you grow but some animals
02:29
grow very quickly right
02:31
like pets dogs and cats they grow very
02:34
quickly you still hard to see you don't
02:36
see it
02:36
right happening right now but you know
02:38
over weeks or months
02:40
very quickly they change they grow they
02:43
become
02:44
bigger or taller our next word
02:48
is to change to change means to become
02:52
different that's a good picture
02:53
right you've all seen an egg right
02:56
sometimes you eat eggs for breakfast
02:58
right
02:58
well those are not eggs that will become
03:00
chickens don't worry
03:02
but they are but an egg that is
03:06
able to become a chicken will hatch
03:08
after a while right
03:10
the egg will change it'll break open and
03:12
a little chick will come out of it
03:14
that's a big change right to become
03:18
different you also change right when you
03:21
were a baby
03:22
now you were a child or a teenager
03:25
you changed right and you will continue
03:28
to change
03:28
through your life we all do okay
03:33
reproduce reproduce
03:37
reproduce reproduce means to make
03:40
more living things of the same kind
03:44
all living things are able to
03:48
reproduce that means that they can make
03:51
more
03:52
living things that look like them when
03:55
you get older you might get married and
03:57
have
03:57
children that means you will reproduce
04:00
right
04:01
when your dog gets older it can meet
04:03
another dog
04:04
become a parent and they will have
04:07
children right
04:08
plants when they get older they send out
04:11
seeds
04:12
or pollen and they will reproduce
04:15
and more plants will grow so to make
04:18
more living things
04:19
of the same kind that's to reproduce
04:23
next word is a sad word die
04:29
to no longer be alive here we have a sad
04:32
picture of a bird
04:33
probably an old bird who became too old
04:36
and then
04:36
died all living things become old
04:40
and die it's part of life the thing is
04:44
enjoy your life while you're live
04:46
while you while you are living right to
04:49
enjoy your life and be good to other
04:50
people that's the important thing
04:53
okay our next word is move to move
04:57
to move means to go from place a to
05:00
place b
05:01
right something is at place a and it
05:04
moves
05:04
over to place b now here we have a
05:07
picture of a snail
05:10
snails are famous for moving very slowly
05:15
somebody might say oh you move like a
05:18
snail
05:18
means you move very slowly
05:22
and probably not a good idea especially
05:25
if you're going to school
05:26
okay so actually we have a video of a
05:29
snail moving
05:30
and you can see i'll start the video
05:32
here you can see
05:34
okay the snail is moving but it's taking
05:38
a long time right very slow
05:41
in the background you saw the cars going
05:43
by very quickly
05:44
cars move fast be careful snails
05:48
move really slow
05:51
this snail's very slow okay we don't
05:53
have time to watch him
05:54
move it would take a long time to see a
05:57
move from one side to the other
05:59
we don't have time okay so next we have
06:03
breathe breathe
06:06
okay we have the e at the end that's
06:08
important i will
06:09
explain soon but
06:13
to breathe means to
06:16
take air into the body actually you take
06:19
it into your lungs
06:20
right and then you send it out again all
06:23
living things breathe now
06:26
animals and plants have different
06:30
ways to breathe but for animals right we
06:34
breathe in the air
06:36
the air goes into our lungs we take the
06:38
oxygen
06:39
out and it goes into our blood and this
06:41
gives us
06:42
energy we need the oxygen
06:46
to live so we breathe in the air
06:49
we don't need all of the air just a
06:51
little part of it is oxygen
06:53
but we take that oxygen and we
06:56
breathe out the breath the air that we
06:59
don't need or the
07:00
the gas that is coming out of our body
07:03
so it's important to think about
07:05
breathe in breathe out
07:08
so we can also say that you breathe in
07:12
and you breathe out okay
07:16
breathe in breathe out
07:19
breathe in breathe out and we do it all
07:21
the time we don't
07:22
even think about it because it's a
07:24
natural part
07:25
of living now i said it's important
07:28
the e at the end now there's a very
07:31
similar word
07:32
it's called it's it's spelled this way
07:36
and this is different so be careful
07:39
breath
07:41
breathe is a verb
07:44
it's the action right i i showed you
07:47
that's to breathe breath
07:51
is a noun okay so
07:55
be careful don't get those two words
07:58
confused we can say
08:02
take a breath
08:06
that is a breath breathe in and breathe
08:08
out
08:09
that is one breath okay so when you talk
08:12
about a breath
08:13
as a noun it's no e and we pronounce it
08:17
breath but if you're talking about the
08:20
action
08:21
that's a verb we put an e on the end and
08:24
we pronounce it breathe
08:27
okay so breath breathe
08:31
be careful don't get them mixed up okay
08:34
good
08:35
okay next we have a video
08:39
now fish can breathe how can fish
08:42
breathe they're under
08:43
water where do they get the air
08:47
well it's interesting because even in
08:50
water
08:50
there is gas water is hydrogen and
08:54
oxygen
08:54
and fish are designed to be able to
08:59
get the gas the oxygen that they need
09:02
through their
09:02
gills right they don't breathe in
09:05
through their mouth
09:06
they have gills on the side of their
09:08
bodies
09:09
and they are able to take in the gas
09:13
that they need
09:13
now if we can see you know we can see
09:16
the little fish moving around it's hard
09:17
to see their gills
09:18
you can see their mouths moving but
09:21
they're not really breathing through
09:22
their mouth
09:23
they're breathing through their gills
09:25
let me write that for you
09:27
gills and i put s because
09:31
a fish have two gills on either side
09:34
right
09:35
and they're kind of their neck and they
09:37
kind of open up and close
09:39
as they're swimming and that's where the
09:42
water passes through and they can catch
09:45
the air or the oxygen that they need
09:47
through their gills so fish obviously
09:50
are much different
09:51
than mammals because they breathe
09:54
differently and they can breathe
09:55
underwater
09:57
mammals can't breathe underwater whales
10:00
and dolphins are mammals
10:01
but they have to come up and they have a
10:03
hole in the back of their head that
10:05
opens up
10:06
and they take in the air and they
10:08
breathe through that hole
10:09
so mammals and whales are not really
10:12
fish they're
10:13
mammals but true fish have gills
10:16
okay interesting next we have oxygen and
10:20
i've said that word before
10:22
oxygen oxygen or oxygen
10:25
if you say it quickly sounds like oxygen
10:28
oxygen oxygen is very important
10:31
obviously
10:32
i just said when we breathe in we need
10:35
the oxygen
10:37
in the air the air around us
10:40
actually you know we it's kind of maybe
10:43
a bigger
10:45
lesson nitrogen and
10:49
oxygen the air right now
10:52
around me and around you uh is
10:56
21 only 21
10:59
oxygen the rest what is that that's 79
11:03
percent
11:05
nitrogen right so we don't need nitrogen
11:08
our bodies don't um
11:12
use nitrogen nitrogen is it's like
11:15
nothing to our body we don't react to
11:17
nitrogen
11:18
but we do react with oxygen and we need
11:22
oxygen to live oxygen goes into our
11:25
blood it helps us
11:26
uh do many of the the functions that our
11:30
cells
11:31
need uh to be able to to do what they
11:34
they do and there's so many different
11:36
cells that do have different tasks
11:39
in our body and that's that helps us to
11:41
live so oxygen is a gas right
11:43
it's a gas that living things need
11:47
we need it fish need it uh many
11:50
different living things
11:51
need uh oxygen and
11:54
mostly the air is 79 nitrogen
11:58
21 oxygen yes there are other gases but
12:01
they're very small
12:02
they're not really measurable uh in any
12:05
situation any typical situation
12:07
okay that we you know in the outside
12:10
okay good so oxygen
12:11
is very important for us and most living
12:14
things
12:16
next we have healthy healthy means to be
12:19
strong and well i hope
12:20
you are healthy and your parents are
12:23
very interested
12:24
or uh they're very worried uh hopefully
12:26
not too worried
12:27
that you stay healthy and you should
12:30
eat well eat good things eat vegetables
12:34
eat you know depending on you know
12:38
meat is good vegetables of course are
12:40
very important
12:41
make sure you eat a balanced diet so to
12:44
stay healthy
12:44
but that's not it you also need to
12:47
exercise this boy is
12:49
exercising because you need to give your
12:52
muscles
12:52
uh the practice or the chance to grow
12:56
strong and you want to stay healthy and
12:58
not just eating and exercise
13:00
you also need sleep so make sure you get
13:03
enough sleep
13:04
put your phone away don't play video
13:07
games too long
13:08
get enough sleep at night all of these
13:11
things
13:12
help you remain healthy and you want to
13:15
be healthy
13:16
all your life of course when you're
13:17
young you're very strong and healthy
13:20
as you get older you have to work harder
13:22
to be
13:23
to stay healthy okay good
13:26
okay now let's take a look
13:30
at the difference between living things
13:34
and non-living things so that's what
13:37
this unit is about really
13:38
living in non-living things how are they
13:41
different
13:42
well we've learned a lot of words in the
13:44
vocabulary section about living things
13:46
we learned
13:47
grow right living things grow they get
13:50
bigger and taller
13:52
so you can see the picture of the swan
13:54
and the little
13:55
baby swans the the
13:58
babies will grow they'll get taller they
14:01
will become adult swans
14:03
do non-living things grow well
14:07
oxygen is a non-living thing it's a gas
14:10
does it grow no it
14:13
you know it might we use it but
14:17
oxygen by itself it doesn't get bigger
14:19
it stays the same
14:20
right it doesn't have a process where it
14:22
gets bigger or taller
14:24
right it just stays the same okay next
14:28
living things change yeah they change of
14:30
course as they grow
14:32
they get bigger they get taller but some
14:34
living things
14:35
change as they uh
14:38
grow or as they become from a baby to a
14:42
child to an adult
14:43
they actually change form for example
14:46
butterflies
14:47
caterpillars they will change form
14:51
as they grow so they change and we saw
14:54
the example of the egg becoming
14:56
the chick they change but do non-living
14:58
things change
14:59
no they do not change right you see a
15:02
rock
15:03
that rock will always be the same it
15:05
doesn't change by itself
15:07
i mean yeah sure i can take a hammer and
15:10
break it and then it changes
15:12
but i had to do that or something else
15:14
had to do that
15:16
the rock by itself will not change by
15:19
itself
15:20
living things do change by themselves
15:23
okay next we have move
15:27
move from one place to another we saw
15:29
the snail
15:30
the snail takes a long time people move
15:33
more quickly
15:34
right and of course
15:37
birds move very fast and horses as we
15:40
can see in the picture
15:41
they move very quickly from one place to
15:44
another
15:44
but do non-living things move by
15:47
themselves
15:48
no they don't i mean you might have a
15:50
doll on your shelf in your bedroom
15:53
but if you put it there and you leave it
15:55
there it's not going to move
15:57
i hope no i'm just kidding no it won't
15:59
move don't worry
16:00
okay so you have to pick it up and put
16:03
it somewhere
16:04
and before in the snail video i said
16:06
look at the cars of course
16:08
people are making those cars move if you
16:10
park the car and leave it
16:12
the car is not going to move by itself
16:15
right
16:15
so non-living things do not move
16:18
by themselves okay next last we have
16:23
reproduce and we can see the mother and
16:26
the father
16:27
and the baby i don't know if it's a girl
16:29
or a boy
16:30
but it's a baby and they have a baby
16:33
mother and the father got together
16:34
they created a baby all living things
16:38
have the ability to reproduce
16:41
to make younger copies of themselves
16:45
they're not perfect copies they're a
16:46
little bit different we wouldn't
16:48
that would be very boring if everybody
16:50
was the same so it's very interesting
16:52
that they're a little bit different
16:53
but we have the ability to reproduce all
16:56
living things
16:57
do non-living things can they reproduce
17:01
no even though in the picture we see
17:03
many houses that look like they're the
17:05
same
17:06
right but those houses didn't reproduce
17:08
by themselves
17:09
no people construction workers
17:13
came and built those houses you know but
17:16
the houses don't get together and have
17:18
babies what's a baby house that's crazy
17:20
we don't if that doesn't happen
17:22
so non-living things do not
17:25
reproduce living things do so this chart
17:28
shows
17:29
us many differences between living
17:32
things
17:32
and non-living things what do living
17:35
things do
17:36
and living things do not do those things
17:39
okay interesting now when we take a look
17:43
at living things we can say that
17:45
all living things do these three things
17:48
in our chart first we can see that all
17:51
living things
17:52
grow the baby drinks milk from her
17:56
mother
17:57
so she can grow right when the mothers
17:59
have the baby
18:00
they will give milk to their babies
18:03
so the baby needs milk and after the
18:05
baby gets older
18:07
the baby doesn't need the milk anymore
18:09
but they still need to eat
18:10
we all need to eat i hope you eat well
18:13
during the day
18:14
and you eat healthy foods to stay
18:17
healthy
18:18
so if you do that you will grow
18:21
strong you will grow well okay that's
18:24
that's important obviously
18:25
so all living things grow the second
18:28
thing is
18:29
change right in the first picture we see
18:32
the baby but maybe
18:33
after a few years now we have a young
18:37
girl right so change the girl you know
18:40
before the girl is a baby right
18:42
she can't talk she'll say but that's not
18:45
talking really
18:47
right but when she gets older she can
18:49
say words she can make
18:50
sentences she can talk say what she's
18:54
thinking that's to talk she can walk by
18:56
ourselves babies don't walk they crawl
18:59
right and she can eat by herself mom
19:02
doesn't have to give her the food
19:04
right it goes down now the the child can
19:06
eat by herself
19:08
so the cha the the baby girl or the baby
19:11
girl
19:11
changed into a child you changed from a
19:14
baby to a child
19:16
or a teenager and later on you will
19:18
become an adult
19:20
you change throughout your life i've
19:22
done most of my
19:23
changing still have some change left in
19:26
me
19:27
but we all change everybody changes
19:30
reproduce reproduce is the third thing
19:34
and that of course is when uh you know
19:37
we can talk about this girl actually
19:39
let's imagine that this is the same
19:41
person in each of the picture
19:42
first we see the little baby right then
19:44
she grows a little bit older she's a
19:46
baby she changes into a child
19:48
many years later she becomes a woman and
19:50
look she has a baby
19:52
of her own right so she reproduced she
19:56
grew older she became
19:57
a woman and with a man she was able to
20:01
reproduce
20:02
so the woman has a baby of her own so
20:06
again all living things are able to
20:08
reproduce to make copies
20:10
of themselves not exact copies but
20:13
copies of themselves new living things
20:17
and that's life okay so living things
20:19
can do that
20:21
okay now it's time for the reading as
20:23
usual
20:24
read along with me maybe you can read
20:26
out loud as i read
20:28
or read along in your head and think
20:30
about the pronunciation of the words
20:33
and of course remember the vocabulary
20:36
that we learned
20:37
at the beginning of this unit are you
20:40
ready
20:41
let's begin in the world
20:46
there are living things and non-living
20:49
things
20:52
a living thing is something that
20:55
is alive
21:00
a chick is a living thing
21:03
a chick lives in a nest
21:07
it needs space to live in
21:11
a chick breathes air
21:15
air has oxygen in it
21:18
do you remember how much right usually
21:22
21 oxygen
21:25
okay okay air has oxygen
21:28
in it almost all living things
21:32
need oxygen to live
21:38
a chick needs to eat and
21:41
drink food and water
21:45
help keep the chick healthy
21:49
keep healthy also stay
21:52
healthy these are very common
21:55
expressions stay
21:57
healthy i hope you stay
22:00
healthy please keep healthy
22:04
okay don't say keep your health that's
22:07
strange just say
22:08
keep healthy or stay healthy okay next
22:13
it grows and changes into
22:16
a chicken right so a baby chick
22:19
will grow and change into
22:23
an adult chicken okay next
22:27
living things can reproduce
22:31
a chicken can make an egg a chick
22:35
comes from an egg
22:38
one day the chicken will die all living
22:42
things
22:43
die okay so living things reproduce
22:46
right
22:46
a chicken makes an egg chick comes from
22:49
the egg
22:50
and then the chick you know the chick is
22:52
born grows older
22:54
becomes an adult and it lays an egg too
22:57
so you know it goes around and around
23:00
and then after a while it will die all
23:03
living things
23:03
die
23:06
some things do not die because they have
23:10
never been alive they are called
23:14
non-living things
23:17
rocks are non-living things
23:21
they do not breathe or grow
23:25
rocks do not need to eat or
23:28
drink a rock does not
23:31
move by itself
23:34
non-living things cannot reproduce
23:39
okay so
23:42
that's interesting that passage
23:44
obviously we had two different things we
23:46
were talking about now
23:47
when you read about two different things
23:50
or you
23:51
you write about two different things
23:52
probably you want to say
23:54
how are they the same or
23:57
how are they different this passage
24:01
obviously was talking about two
24:03
different things
24:04
and they are different they're not the
24:06
same they're different one
24:07
thing first we saw and we read about
24:10
living things and we learned what living
24:13
things
24:13
do then in the middle of the passage we
24:17
changed we
24:18
switched we transitioned
24:22
right we had a transition
24:26
sorry a transition a transition
24:30
is when you change from one subject to
24:33
another
24:34
so in the middle of this of the
24:35
paragraph we had a
24:37
transition and we started talking about
24:41
non-living things so first we talked
24:44
about living things
24:45
then we transitioned into talking about
24:49
non-living things and we showed how they
24:52
are
24:52
different so this is contrast
24:55
not comparison contrast
24:58
okay so when your teacher says you know
25:01
compare
25:02
or contrast should you really be compare
25:04
or contrast
25:05
two different things uh you can compare
25:08
them or
25:09
you could compare and contrast that
25:11
would be a bit longer you can say how
25:13
they're the same
25:14
and then how they're different you could
25:16
also do that that's another
25:18
plan for your essay or for your writing
25:21
passage but anyway this was contrast so
25:25
on the left hand side we have living
25:28
things
25:29
on the right hand side we have
25:31
non-living things
25:32
how are they different how do they
25:34
contrast
25:35
contrast equals different right show
25:38
difference
25:40
so let's start with the left side at the
25:43
top
25:44
it says living things are
25:47
beep living things are what
25:50
well living things are uh it wasn't
25:53
it was similar to a vocabulary word it's
25:55
not exactly the same but in the reading
25:57
passage remember
25:58
it said living things are what do they
26:01
do they live if something
26:03
lives it is alive
26:06
right so living things are
26:10
alive living things are alive alive
26:14
we say it is alive because we say it
26:17
lives so to live is a verb
26:20
alive is an adjective right they are
26:23
alive right it is alive
26:27
okay good living things need food
26:31
water and peep
26:34
what else do they need well we talked
26:36
about food we talked about
26:38
water well in the vocabulary section we
26:40
talked about something
26:42
that living things need and to get it
26:46
right to get that thing we have to do
26:48
something
26:49
we have to breathe uh what are we
26:52
getting when we breathe
26:54
we are getting oxygen oxygen
26:59
oxygen
27:01
so living things need food water and
27:04
oxygen in order to continue living if
27:07
you don't get food
27:08
you die if you don't get water you die
27:10
if you don't get oxygen
27:12
you die so don't die get food get water
27:16
get oxygen
27:17
stay healthy okay good
27:20
so living things beep and change
27:24
now that kind of means the same thing
27:26
right but
27:27
uh they're a little bit different right
27:29
because they change how do they change
27:31
they get bigger and they get taller when
27:33
something gets
27:34
bigger and or taller what are they doing
27:36
what's the vocabulary word
27:39
grow that's right grow
27:42
so living things grow and change as they
27:45
grow of course
27:46
they change now living things can
27:51
beep what do living things
27:54
do that non-living things cannot do now
27:58
this
27:58
now there's a lot of choices we could
28:00
use for d
28:01
but we can just go over to the right
28:03
hand side and see ah
28:05
it's the opposite of what is on the
28:06
right hand side so we say living things
28:08
can breathe
28:10
well or living things can grow or living
28:13
things can reproduce
28:14
which one is it so let's look over
28:16
non-living things cannot make
28:18
new things like themselves aha make
28:22
new things like themselves what does
28:25
that mean
28:25
the vocabulary word was reproduce so we
28:29
want to show
28:29
the exact difference so we need to put
28:31
that here re-produce
28:36
oops i'm sorry reproduce u-c-e
28:39
okay let me write that again re-pro
28:46
okay a little weird with this pen okay
28:48
reproduce
28:50
so living things can reproduce those are
28:52
things that living things can do
28:54
they're opposite of the other thing of
28:57
the other
28:58
side non-living things so we said living
29:00
things are alive
29:02
non-living things are not alive okay
29:05
that would be the direct
29:07
opposite direct
29:12
opposite how are they different right
29:15
how how do you contrast them what is the
29:18
direct
29:19
opposite alive not alive
29:22
um living things need food water and
29:25
beep
29:26
oxygen we already have that but
29:27
non-living things do not need food water
29:29
or
29:30
oxygen of course we can just use the
29:32
same word because
29:34
do not need is the direct opposite of
29:37
need okay direct opposite so
29:41
living things grow and change non-living
29:43
things do not
29:45
grow or change grow
29:48
or change so do not is the opposite of
29:52
we don't need do here but actually you
29:54
know do is kind of what we
29:55
say implied we don't need it
29:59
we don't say it we don't say living
30:00
things do grow and change we don't need
30:02
to
30:03
but if you say it negatively then you
30:06
say do not
30:07
right living living non-living things do
30:10
not
30:10
grow or change okay that's the direct
30:14
opposite of what they do do
30:17
okay and then finally as we saw before
30:21
living things can reproduce non-living
30:23
things cannot make
30:24
new things like themselves that's the
30:26
same as saying reproduce
30:28
okay so basically this chart shows us
30:32
uh the difference the opposites
30:36
uh characteristics between living things
30:39
and non-living things you know
30:41
what do living things do what do
30:43
non-living things
30:45
not do right how are they different okay
30:48
so that was an interesting unit right we
30:51
talked about the differences between
30:52
living things and non-living things
30:54
and we focused on what do living things
30:57
do
30:58
and what non-living things don't
31:02
do okay so kind of an interesting lesson
31:05
well that's it for today i hope you
31:08
learned a lot as always
31:09
and we'll see you in the next unit or
31:12
the next lesson
31:13
