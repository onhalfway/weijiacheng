hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
we're going over science book four
lesson three animal adaptations
so we will discover how animals change
over time and how one bird
hides in nature
as usual we start with the vocabulary
our first word today is
ant eater this is actually two words
as you can see ant right little
uh i think you say gamey in korean
little little ants running around
and then eater so it's an interesting
word
something that eats ants okay
so anteater is an animal that has a long
nose
and eats ants and this is a good picture
of an
ant eater it's a really strange looking
animal isn't it
but it's a very unique and amazing
animal as all animals are actually okay
let's move on
tongue tongue of course is the soft
movable
part in your mouth i would show you mine
but it seems a little rude to stick your
tongue out at another person
so don't do that we can see a picture of
a frog
a frog has a very famous tongue and a
very interesting tongue
we can see the tongue of the frog here
well look at how long that is
and the frog can flick can flick its
tongue out or
throw its tongue out at an insect
far away from the frog and catch it
because the tongue is sticky so the
frog uses its tongue to catch its food
insects very interesting
underground underground of course we
live
above ground we don't usually say above
ground because that's normal for us
but if we go under the ground that's a
little odd so we say
underground and again we have another
word that has
two words of course we call these types
of words
compound words compound words because
compound
is when you take two or more things and
you join them together
to make one thing and we've joined two
words
under and ground to make one word
and that means of course below the
ground
if you use the subway in your city you
travel
underground unless your subway comes up
sometimes above ground
but usually the subway sub means under
way is path subway is another compound
word but subway
would be under the ground right usually
under the ground and many
animals of course live underground
ants worms looks like a caterpillar or
some kind of grub
and then looks like a mole and other
animals will live
underground they make their homes in the
ground
underground okay spray
to spray is to blow liquid into the air
and of course
mom uses something or dad of course
we'll use a cleaner you know and it
sprays you
you have a little trigger here you push
the trigger and it sprays the cleaning
liquid
onto the glass or the kitchen countertop
or something like that
be careful also because when you speak
you also spray your spit from your mouth
and that's why it's a good idea to wear
a mask when people are worried about
catching diseases
right so spray is just to blow liquid
into the air whether it's normally
through your mouth while you're talking
or through a spray bottle when you're
cleaning
something but to spray okay
adapt adapt means to change
to change in order to be successful in a
new situation
so let's say you change schools
your family moves from one city to
another
or even better your family moves from
one country
to another that's a better example
because when you move to the new country
maybe they're speaking a new language
they have different customs
they have different ways to dress
different maybe different clothes
you have to change your behavior
your speech and the way that you act
probably
to adapt to the new situation
the new environment in which you live
and animals
living creatures do this all the time
because the environment
is always changing around us so we adapt
to our environment adapt to change
and of course we want to be successful
if we don't change
we won't be successful right some people
say change or die
okay that's that's a natural law right
so if living creatures don't change many
of them will die
they have to change to be successful in
their new
environment next we have oh it was a
big word a little bit difficult right
how do you pronounce that
camouflage camouflage
camouflage is an interesting word it's
an interesting idea too
take a look at this picture it's an
interesting lizard right looks like an
iguana
but um some lizards some frogs and other
animals also
will be able to change their color
and you know change their color i don't
mean like over a long period of time i
mean
right away like this type of lizard
frogs can do this octopus if you ever
see an octopus under water they're
amazing
the color is you know like pulsing on
their skin
as you watch them and they're blending
in camouflage is basically
an animal's color or sometimes the shape
of the animal also
makes it hard to see it in nature it's
hard to see this lizard because it can
change
the color of its skin to the same color
of the tree on which it sits
frogs can do this too some frogs and
like i said
octopus if you ever look at an octopus
moving over
a coral reef you know the coral reef has
many different colors
and the octopus changes so it matches
the colors
as it moves over the reef it's really
amazing so
that is camouflage sometimes people will
wear camouflage right
they'll wear a jacket or pants that
have the the black and the green pattern
on it
and that's also what we call camouflage
too because if they go in the forest
it would be hard to see them because
they're wearing black and green clothes
right
so that's camouflage
and we have a video showing camouflage
look at this picture i'll start the
video can you see the creature
it's like playing where's waldo where's
oh wait oh there it is it's a butterfly
of course when it opens its wings right
we can see it easily because then it's
not camouflaged but when it closes its
wings
it's a little difficult to see because
it looks
like part of the tree bark so that's a
type of
camouflage next word is
skunk a skunk is an animal that looks
like this it's usually black
and uh with white fur black and white
fur on it
and uh you have to be careful around
skunks josh
be careful a skunk is a black and white
animal
that can make a bad smell actually the
skunk can
spray how can they make the bat smell in
their tail they have these little
ducks and they can shoot they can spray
this
really bad smelling a liquid
at people or animals usually
animals that try to catch them of course
a skunk isn't a very strong animal
and you know if a dog or a wolf or a
coyote
or even a bear tries to eat the skunk
the skunk just turns around raises its
tail
and makes it shoots a spray at the
animal
and the animals you know most many
animals are very
sensitive with their nose they can smell
a lot
better than we can so their sense of
smell is very strong
and when the skunk hits the the animal
especially the nose with that spray
the animal is like whoa i don't i don't
want to deal with this animal
this animal smells really bad so then
they run away
and the skunk survives so that's kind of
an interesting
way that the skunk uses to survive to
stay alive
okay that's our vocabulary for this
lesson
so let's take a look at a lot of
different examples
of animal adaptations remember before we
talked about
adapt that's the verb if we want to make
it into a noun we say
adaptation adaptation is a change
and we can see many different animals
here we have four different animals
that have all adapted to their
environment and actually of course
every animal that you see and i'm
including us too us human beings
we have all changed over millions of
years
to suit our environment to be successful
in our environment and it's interesting
too because you look at all of these
animals they're
all have the same body type they all
have a vertebrae a spine a backbone
two arms two legs two ears two eyes and
a nose
every animal but because they all have
the same ancestor
so over time right different families or
different
uh uh individuals of these species
may have adapted or changed differently
to their environment and they become new
animals
they all have the same body parts but
some body parts might be longer or
shorter
or different colors and do different
things
than other animals and that's just
adaptation
over time so these are examples of
animal adaptations
and how do animals change to be
successful in their environments well
first we can see the first animal here
that is what is that
that is a giraffe right a giraffe of
course is famous for its really long
neck
why does it have a long neck because it
can eat the leaves
high up in the trees right if there's a
certain amount of food
in the in the environment usually a lot
of animals that eat
plants they're eating the grass and the
leaves that are
low to the ground but giraffes because
of their long neck
they can reach up in the trees other
animals can't get there
so the giraffes don't have to worry
about fighting with other
animals to eat the plants on the ground
they've got all the
they've got all the food they want up in
the trees and it's all theirs
so that's one way that giraffes have
adapted to their environment
we talked about an anteater in our
vocabulary section here we have an ant
eater
of course look at that mouth on that
anteater right
his eyes are up here right his eyes are
up here look at that no
no is that right no i'm sorry those are
his ears his eyes right there
right his ears but look at that look at
that mouth that's
huge right that's a really long nose and
of course
mouth and tongue his tongue is also very
long
because he can stick that tongue into
the ant hole
and get the ants that are underground
poor hands they're like they're just
going about their business in their home
along comes this big long sticky tongue
and sucks them all
up okay so an anteater of course
they don't have to worry again about
competing with other animals
because they have adapted specifically
to eat ants underground
and no other animal can do that so
that's a very successful technique
that anteaters have developed next we
have a frog and i've talked about the
frog's tongue right
the frog is very interest is very unique
in being able to throw its tongue
at insects and catch them and the tongue
is very fast
you can't you can't really see it with
your eye you have to take like slow
motion photography
to see the frog's tongue come out of its
mouth and grab that insect it's
it's really amazing so a long tongue to
help get
food so frogs will use their tongues
to help them eat capture food and of
course i talked about the skunk
the skunk is unique because it has a bad
smelling liquid
that it sprays to keep safe from
other animals so as you can see all of
these animals are unique and
amazingly so in their own way they've
all changed
to help them survive in their
environment and that's basically
evolution
okay next idea
another example of evolution or changing
to adapt to your circumstances
is camouflage and that was one of our
words in
the vocabulary section so an example of
camouflage
what is this animal tarmagen
how do you pronounce that why did they
do that well actually when you pronounce
this word the p
is silent so it's tarmagen tarmagen
it's a bird it's similar probably
there's many wild birds of course many
wild
birds are wild but it's not like a
chicken it's a wild bird it's not a
domesticated bird
it lives in the wild and like many
animals
rabbits for example different types of
mammals will change the color of in this
case of course a bird has
feathers but other animals might change
the color of their fur i'm thinking
about
rabbits especially rabbits that live
in in very cold or snowy environments or
climates
they can change their color to match the
season
and that's exactly what's going on here
with the tarmogen
in the summer the tarmagen has brown
feathers
so that it looks similar to the rocks of
the brown
ground where it runs around so it's hard
to see it
in the fall the tarmogen's feathers
begin to turn
white why because winter is coming and
with winter
snow and of course snow is white so by
the time winter comes around
the tarmogen's feathers are all white
and it blends
with the snow so it's hard to see the
tarmogen
in the snow and that's a good another
good example of
camouflage
okay let's do the reading as usual i
will read out loud
read along with me practice
pronunciation or read along silently in
your mind
but focus on the words especially from
the vocabulary
and focus on how to pronounce some of
the more difficult words
are you guys ready let's begin
over a long time animal bodies have
adapted
to their habitats these changes are
called
adaptations adaptations
can help an animal get food
giraffes have long necks giraffes depend
on this adaptation to eat leaves
high up in trees
anteaters have very long tongues
they eat ants that live underground
anteaters use their long tongues to get
the ants
frogs also have long tongues
their long tongues help them to get food
an adaptation can help an animal
be safe a skunk
can spray a liquid that smells very bad
skunks depend on this liquid to keep
them safe
from other animals
some animals eat other animals
many animals have camouflage
they look like objects around them
it is difficult to see an animal with
camouflage camouflage helps
keep the animals safe from other
animals okay
how is this reading organized how is the
information in this reading organized
well over on the left side we have
causes on the right side we have effect
on the left side the causes are
basically the adaptations that these
animals have
and the effect or the result is how does
it help them
live or be successful in their
environment
so let's take a look over on the left
side the first one we have
giraffes have long what remember what
giraffes are famous for
they have long necks
n e c k and s
b we have to use s because giraffes is
plural
so nex should be plural that's proper
grammar
we wouldn't say giraffes have long neck
that doesn't make sense that's not
proper grammatically
they don't don't they don't all have the
same neck they have many different necks
so giraffes have long necks remember
pleural plural
good what is the result of that
if a giraffe has a long neck what is the
result
the result is they can eat leaves from
the top
of a tree and so giraffes don't have to
worry
about competing with other animals they
can just
eat the leaves off the top of the tree
and they're happy
so they don't have to worry okay next
we have ant eaters have long
what and we talked about this they have
a really long mouth
because they have a really long tongue
that they can stick out so they have
long tongues
and again tongues
we have to put oops sorry we have to put
s
right anteaters s tongues s so
ant eaters have long tongues
what what's the effect of that they can
eat ants they can eat ants
that live underground they can stick
their tongue
underground and get those ants delicious
maybe i don't know i don't think so not
for us but for anteaters yes okay good
so next last we have frogs have what
what do frogs have
well we could say tongues because we
talked about that
but wait a minute the next sentence is
related to this
they look like objects near them so
tongues wouldn't be a proper fit here
because tongues don't help frogs
look like the objects around them what
does
remember that really difficult word we
saw in the vocabularies
it was quite long it's also difficult to
spell
but remember it it lets them look like
their surrounding and other animals we
talked about i talked about octopus
right
and in the example we saw the tarmogen
the bird that changes
feathers um the color of its feathers
over time
what do we call that we call that
camouflage
so c a m o u
f l a g e
camouflage camouflage
and because of camouflage they are hard
to
see this keeps them safe from other
animals because
you know animals that might eat those
frogs or
or birds or octopi octopuses
can't see them very well it's like where
are they i can't see them
so they won't eat them okay so
camouflage
keeps them safe from other animals
okay very good interesting lesson we
talked about different animals
how they have changed remember all
animals
every animal that you can see and most
animals that have
died in the past they all have changed
to be successful with the environment
animals that don't
change or or if the environment changes
very quickly
then the animals don't have time to
adapt they will die
and a lot of life has died on earth in
the past
but a lot of life continues to live and
if you look around
the biological world out there is very
amazing there's a lot of
really interesting unique amazing
animals out there
so next time you go to the zoo or you
take a walk through the forest or the
mountain
near where you live take a look around
look at the animals the insects the
birds
think about how did they change to fit
their environment
you also think about how did you change
to adapt your environment
okay adapt to your environment okay well
thanks for
studying with me as usual hope you
learned a lot of interesting words
and also some interesting ideas about
nature
take care and we'll see you in the next
lesson bye bye everybody

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading
00:11
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
00:13
we're going over science book four
00:16
lesson three animal adaptations
00:20
so we will discover how animals change
00:23
over time and how one bird
00:27
hides in nature
00:33
as usual we start with the vocabulary
00:36
our first word today is
00:38
ant eater this is actually two words
00:42
as you can see ant right little
00:45
uh i think you say gamey in korean
00:47
little little ants running around
00:50
and then eater so it's an interesting
00:52
word
00:53
something that eats ants okay
00:57
so anteater is an animal that has a long
01:00
nose
01:01
and eats ants and this is a good picture
01:03
of an
01:04
ant eater it's a really strange looking
01:06
animal isn't it
01:08
but it's a very unique and amazing
01:11
animal as all animals are actually okay
01:14
let's move on
01:17
tongue tongue of course is the soft
01:21
movable
01:22
part in your mouth i would show you mine
01:25
but it seems a little rude to stick your
01:27
tongue out at another person
01:29
so don't do that we can see a picture of
01:32
a frog
01:33
a frog has a very famous tongue and a
01:36
very interesting tongue
01:37
we can see the tongue of the frog here
01:39
well look at how long that is
01:41
and the frog can flick can flick its
01:45
tongue out or
01:45
throw its tongue out at an insect
01:49
far away from the frog and catch it
01:52
because the tongue is sticky so the
01:56
frog uses its tongue to catch its food
01:59
insects very interesting
02:04
underground underground of course we
02:06
live
02:07
above ground we don't usually say above
02:09
ground because that's normal for us
02:11
but if we go under the ground that's a
02:14
little odd so we say
02:15
underground and again we have another
02:17
word that has
02:18
two words of course we call these types
02:21
of words
02:22
compound words compound words because
02:26
compound
02:27
is when you take two or more things and
02:29
you join them together
02:31
to make one thing and we've joined two
02:33
words
02:34
under and ground to make one word
02:38
and that means of course below the
02:40
ground
02:41
if you use the subway in your city you
02:44
travel
02:45
underground unless your subway comes up
02:47
sometimes above ground
02:48
but usually the subway sub means under
02:52
way is path subway is another compound
02:54
word but subway
02:56
would be under the ground right usually
02:58
under the ground and many
02:59
animals of course live underground
03:02
ants worms looks like a caterpillar or
03:06
some kind of grub
03:07
and then looks like a mole and other
03:11
animals will live
03:12
underground they make their homes in the
03:15
ground
03:15
underground okay spray
03:20
to spray is to blow liquid into the air
03:24
and of course
03:24
mom uses something or dad of course
03:27
we'll use a cleaner you know and it
03:29
sprays you
03:30
you have a little trigger here you push
03:32
the trigger and it sprays the cleaning
03:34
liquid
03:35
onto the glass or the kitchen countertop
03:38
or something like that
03:40
be careful also because when you speak
03:43
you also spray your spit from your mouth
03:46
and that's why it's a good idea to wear
03:48
a mask when people are worried about
03:51
catching diseases
03:52
right so spray is just to blow liquid
03:56
into the air whether it's normally
03:57
through your mouth while you're talking
03:59
or through a spray bottle when you're
04:03
cleaning
04:03
something but to spray okay
04:08
adapt adapt means to change
04:13
to change in order to be successful in a
04:16
new situation
04:18
so let's say you change schools
04:21
your family moves from one city to
04:24
another
04:25
or even better your family moves from
04:28
one country
04:29
to another that's a better example
04:31
because when you move to the new country
04:34
maybe they're speaking a new language
04:36
they have different customs
04:38
they have different ways to dress
04:40
different maybe different clothes
04:42
you have to change your behavior
04:46
your speech and the way that you act
04:48
probably
04:49
to adapt to the new situation
04:52
the new environment in which you live
04:55
and animals
04:56
living creatures do this all the time
04:58
because the environment
05:00
is always changing around us so we adapt
05:04
to our environment adapt to change
05:07
and of course we want to be successful
05:08
if we don't change
05:11
we won't be successful right some people
05:13
say change or die
05:14
okay that's that's a natural law right
05:17
so if living creatures don't change many
05:20
of them will die
05:21
they have to change to be successful in
05:24
their new
05:25
environment next we have oh it was a
05:30
big word a little bit difficult right
05:32
how do you pronounce that
05:35
camouflage camouflage
05:38
camouflage is an interesting word it's
05:40
an interesting idea too
05:42
take a look at this picture it's an
05:44
interesting lizard right looks like an
05:46
iguana
05:47
but um some lizards some frogs and other
05:50
animals also
05:52
will be able to change their color
05:55
and you know change their color i don't
05:57
mean like over a long period of time i
05:59
mean
06:00
right away like this type of lizard
06:03
frogs can do this octopus if you ever
06:05
see an octopus under water they're
06:07
amazing
06:08
the color is you know like pulsing on
06:10
their skin
06:12
as you watch them and they're blending
06:13
in camouflage is basically
06:17
an animal's color or sometimes the shape
06:19
of the animal also
06:20
makes it hard to see it in nature it's
06:23
hard to see this lizard because it can
06:25
change
06:26
the color of its skin to the same color
06:29
of the tree on which it sits
06:33
frogs can do this too some frogs and
06:35
like i said
06:36
octopus if you ever look at an octopus
06:38
moving over
06:39
a coral reef you know the coral reef has
06:41
many different colors
06:42
and the octopus changes so it matches
06:45
the colors
06:46
as it moves over the reef it's really
06:48
amazing so
06:49
that is camouflage sometimes people will
06:52
wear camouflage right
06:53
they'll wear a jacket or pants that
06:56
have the the black and the green pattern
07:00
on it
07:00
and that's also what we call camouflage
07:03
too because if they go in the forest
07:04
it would be hard to see them because
07:06
they're wearing black and green clothes
07:08
right
07:09
so that's camouflage
07:12
and we have a video showing camouflage
07:16
look at this picture i'll start the
07:17
video can you see the creature
07:20
it's like playing where's waldo where's
07:22
oh wait oh there it is it's a butterfly
07:25
of course when it opens its wings right
07:27
we can see it easily because then it's
07:29
not camouflaged but when it closes its
07:31
wings
07:32
it's a little difficult to see because
07:35
it looks
07:36
like part of the tree bark so that's a
07:39
type of
07:40
camouflage next word is
07:44
skunk a skunk is an animal that looks
07:48
like this it's usually black
07:49
and uh with white fur black and white
07:52
fur on it
07:53
and uh you have to be careful around
07:55
skunks josh
07:56
be careful a skunk is a black and white
07:59
animal
08:00
that can make a bad smell actually the
08:03
skunk can
08:04
spray how can they make the bat smell in
08:07
their tail they have these little
08:09
ducks and they can shoot they can spray
08:12
this
08:12
really bad smelling a liquid
08:15
at people or animals usually
08:18
animals that try to catch them of course
08:21
a skunk isn't a very strong animal
08:23
and you know if a dog or a wolf or a
08:26
coyote
08:26
or even a bear tries to eat the skunk
08:29
the skunk just turns around raises its
08:31
tail
08:32
and makes it shoots a spray at the
08:35
animal
08:36
and the animals you know most many
08:37
animals are very
08:39
sensitive with their nose they can smell
08:42
a lot
08:43
better than we can so their sense of
08:46
smell is very strong
08:47
and when the skunk hits the the animal
08:50
especially the nose with that spray
08:52
the animal is like whoa i don't i don't
08:54
want to deal with this animal
08:55
this animal smells really bad so then
08:57
they run away
08:58
and the skunk survives so that's kind of
09:00
an interesting
09:01
way that the skunk uses to survive to
09:04
stay alive
09:06
okay that's our vocabulary for this
09:08
lesson
09:12
so let's take a look at a lot of
09:13
different examples
09:15
of animal adaptations remember before we
09:19
talked about
09:20
adapt that's the verb if we want to make
09:22
it into a noun we say
09:24
adaptation adaptation is a change
09:27
and we can see many different animals
09:29
here we have four different animals
09:32
that have all adapted to their
09:33
environment and actually of course
09:35
every animal that you see and i'm
09:37
including us too us human beings
09:40
we have all changed over millions of
09:43
years
09:44
to suit our environment to be successful
09:48
in our environment and it's interesting
09:50
too because you look at all of these
09:52
animals they're
09:53
all have the same body type they all
09:56
have a vertebrae a spine a backbone
09:59
two arms two legs two ears two eyes and
10:02
a nose
10:03
every animal but because they all have
10:06
the same ancestor
10:08
so over time right different families or
10:11
different
10:12
uh uh individuals of these species
10:16
may have adapted or changed differently
10:20
to their environment and they become new
10:23
animals
10:24
they all have the same body parts but
10:26
some body parts might be longer or
10:28
shorter
10:29
or different colors and do different
10:32
things
10:32
than other animals and that's just
10:35
adaptation
10:36
over time so these are examples of
10:38
animal adaptations
10:40
and how do animals change to be
10:43
successful in their environments well
10:45
first we can see the first animal here
10:47
that is what is that
10:48
that is a giraffe right a giraffe of
10:51
course is famous for its really long
10:53
neck
10:55
why does it have a long neck because it
10:57
can eat the leaves
10:58
high up in the trees right if there's a
11:01
certain amount of food
11:02
in the in the environment usually a lot
11:06
of animals that eat
11:07
plants they're eating the grass and the
11:09
leaves that are
11:10
low to the ground but giraffes because
11:13
of their long neck
11:14
they can reach up in the trees other
11:16
animals can't get there
11:17
so the giraffes don't have to worry
11:19
about fighting with other
11:21
animals to eat the plants on the ground
11:24
they've got all the
11:25
they've got all the food they want up in
11:27
the trees and it's all theirs
11:28
so that's one way that giraffes have
11:31
adapted to their environment
11:34
we talked about an anteater in our
11:36
vocabulary section here we have an ant
11:38
eater
11:38
of course look at that mouth on that
11:41
anteater right
11:42
his eyes are up here right his eyes are
11:44
up here look at that no
11:45
no is that right no i'm sorry those are
11:47
his ears his eyes right there
11:48
right his ears but look at that look at
11:51
that mouth that's
11:52
huge right that's a really long nose and
11:55
of course
11:56
mouth and tongue his tongue is also very
11:59
long
11:59
because he can stick that tongue into
12:01
the ant hole
12:03
and get the ants that are underground
12:05
poor hands they're like they're just
12:06
going about their business in their home
12:08
along comes this big long sticky tongue
12:11
and sucks them all
12:12
up okay so an anteater of course
12:15
they don't have to worry again about
12:18
competing with other animals
12:20
because they have adapted specifically
12:22
to eat ants underground
12:24
and no other animal can do that so
12:26
that's a very successful technique
12:29
that anteaters have developed next we
12:32
have a frog and i've talked about the
12:33
frog's tongue right
12:35
the frog is very interest is very unique
12:37
in being able to throw its tongue
12:39
at insects and catch them and the tongue
12:41
is very fast
12:42
you can't you can't really see it with
12:45
your eye you have to take like slow
12:46
motion photography
12:48
to see the frog's tongue come out of its
12:50
mouth and grab that insect it's
12:52
it's really amazing so a long tongue to
12:55
help get
12:55
food so frogs will use their tongues
12:58
to help them eat capture food and of
13:01
course i talked about the skunk
13:03
the skunk is unique because it has a bad
13:05
smelling liquid
13:06
that it sprays to keep safe from
13:09
other animals so as you can see all of
13:12
these animals are unique and
13:13
amazingly so in their own way they've
13:16
all changed
13:17
to help them survive in their
13:20
environment and that's basically
13:21
evolution
13:23
okay next idea
13:26
another example of evolution or changing
13:29
to adapt to your circumstances
13:31
is camouflage and that was one of our
13:34
words in
13:35
the vocabulary section so an example of
13:37
camouflage
13:38
what is this animal tarmagen
13:42
how do you pronounce that why did they
13:44
do that well actually when you pronounce
13:46
this word the p
13:47
is silent so it's tarmagen tarmagen
13:51
it's a bird it's similar probably
13:55
there's many wild birds of course many
13:57
wild
13:58
birds are wild but it's not like a
13:59
chicken it's a wild bird it's not a
14:01
domesticated bird
14:02
it lives in the wild and like many
14:04
animals
14:06
rabbits for example different types of
14:11
mammals will change the color of in this
14:14
case of course a bird has
14:15
feathers but other animals might change
14:17
the color of their fur i'm thinking
14:19
about
14:20
rabbits especially rabbits that live
14:23
in in very cold or snowy environments or
14:26
climates
14:26
they can change their color to match the
14:29
season
14:30
and that's exactly what's going on here
14:32
with the tarmogen
14:34
in the summer the tarmagen has brown
14:36
feathers
14:37
so that it looks similar to the rocks of
14:39
the brown
14:41
ground where it runs around so it's hard
14:44
to see it
14:45
in the fall the tarmogen's feathers
14:47
begin to turn
14:48
white why because winter is coming and
14:51
with winter
14:52
snow and of course snow is white so by
14:55
the time winter comes around
14:57
the tarmogen's feathers are all white
14:59
and it blends
15:00
with the snow so it's hard to see the
15:03
tarmogen
15:04
in the snow and that's a good another
15:07
good example of
15:10
camouflage
15:14
okay let's do the reading as usual i
15:16
will read out loud
15:18
read along with me practice
15:19
pronunciation or read along silently in
15:22
your mind
15:22
but focus on the words especially from
15:25
the vocabulary
15:26
and focus on how to pronounce some of
15:28
the more difficult words
15:30
are you guys ready let's begin
15:33
over a long time animal bodies have
15:37
adapted
15:38
to their habitats these changes are
15:41
called
15:42
adaptations adaptations
15:45
can help an animal get food
15:51
giraffes have long necks giraffes depend
15:55
on this adaptation to eat leaves
15:58
high up in trees
16:02
anteaters have very long tongues
16:06
they eat ants that live underground
16:10
anteaters use their long tongues to get
16:13
the ants
16:15
frogs also have long tongues
16:19
their long tongues help them to get food
16:26
an adaptation can help an animal
16:29
be safe a skunk
16:33
can spray a liquid that smells very bad
16:37
skunks depend on this liquid to keep
16:40
them safe
16:41
from other animals
16:45
some animals eat other animals
16:49
many animals have camouflage
16:52
they look like objects around them
16:56
it is difficult to see an animal with
16:59
camouflage camouflage helps
17:02
keep the animals safe from other
17:06
animals okay
17:10
how is this reading organized how is the
17:14
information in this reading organized
17:16
well over on the left side we have
17:18
causes on the right side we have effect
17:20
on the left side the causes are
17:22
basically the adaptations that these
17:25
animals have
17:26
and the effect or the result is how does
17:28
it help them
17:30
live or be successful in their
17:32
environment
17:33
so let's take a look over on the left
17:35
side the first one we have
17:37
giraffes have long what remember what
17:40
giraffes are famous for
17:42
they have long necks
17:45
n e c k and s
17:48
b we have to use s because giraffes is
17:51
plural
17:51
so nex should be plural that's proper
17:54
grammar
17:54
we wouldn't say giraffes have long neck
17:58
that doesn't make sense that's not
18:00
proper grammatically
18:01
they don't don't they don't all have the
18:04
same neck they have many different necks
18:06
so giraffes have long necks remember
18:08
pleural plural
18:09
good what is the result of that
18:13
if a giraffe has a long neck what is the
18:15
result
18:17
the result is they can eat leaves from
18:19
the top
18:20
of a tree and so giraffes don't have to
18:23
worry
18:24
about competing with other animals they
18:28
can just
18:28
eat the leaves off the top of the tree
18:30
and they're happy
18:32
so they don't have to worry okay next
18:35
we have ant eaters have long
18:38
what and we talked about this they have
18:40
a really long mouth
18:41
because they have a really long tongue
18:44
that they can stick out so they have
18:45
long tongues
18:46
and again tongues
18:49
we have to put oops sorry we have to put
18:52
s
18:53
right anteaters s tongues s so
18:56
ant eaters have long tongues
18:59
what what's the effect of that they can
19:01
eat ants they can eat ants
19:03
that live underground they can stick
19:06
their tongue
19:07
underground and get those ants delicious
19:10
maybe i don't know i don't think so not
19:12
for us but for anteaters yes okay good
19:15
so next last we have frogs have what
19:18
what do frogs have
19:20
well we could say tongues because we
19:22
talked about that
19:23
but wait a minute the next sentence is
19:26
related to this
19:27
they look like objects near them so
19:30
tongues wouldn't be a proper fit here
19:32
because tongues don't help frogs
19:35
look like the objects around them what
19:38
does
19:38
remember that really difficult word we
19:41
saw in the vocabularies
19:42
it was quite long it's also difficult to
19:45
spell
19:46
but remember it it lets them look like
19:49
their surrounding and other animals we
19:51
talked about i talked about octopus
19:52
right
19:53
and in the example we saw the tarmogen
19:56
the bird that changes
19:57
feathers um the color of its feathers
20:00
over time
20:01
what do we call that we call that
20:03
camouflage
20:05
so c a m o u
20:08
f l a g e
20:13
camouflage camouflage
20:16
and because of camouflage they are hard
20:19
to
20:20
see this keeps them safe from other
20:22
animals because
20:23
you know animals that might eat those
20:26
frogs or
20:27
or birds or octopi octopuses
20:30
can't see them very well it's like where
20:32
are they i can't see them
20:34
so they won't eat them okay so
20:37
camouflage
20:38
keeps them safe from other animals
20:41
okay very good interesting lesson we
20:43
talked about different animals
20:45
how they have changed remember all
20:47
animals
20:48
every animal that you can see and most
20:50
animals that have
20:51
died in the past they all have changed
20:55
to be successful with the environment
20:57
animals that don't
20:58
change or or if the environment changes
21:00
very quickly
21:02
then the animals don't have time to
21:03
adapt they will die
21:05
and a lot of life has died on earth in
21:07
the past
21:08
but a lot of life continues to live and
21:11
if you look around
21:12
the biological world out there is very
21:14
amazing there's a lot of
21:16
really interesting unique amazing
21:19
animals out there
21:20
so next time you go to the zoo or you
21:22
take a walk through the forest or the
21:24
mountain
21:24
near where you live take a look around
21:27
look at the animals the insects the
21:29
birds
21:30
think about how did they change to fit
21:32
their environment
21:33
you also think about how did you change
21:35
to adapt your environment
21:37
okay adapt to your environment okay well
21:39
thanks for
21:40
studying with me as usual hope you
21:42
learned a lot of interesting words
21:43
and also some interesting ideas about
21:46
nature
21:47
take care and we'll see you in the next
21:49
lesson bye bye everybody
21:59
[Music]
22:11
you
