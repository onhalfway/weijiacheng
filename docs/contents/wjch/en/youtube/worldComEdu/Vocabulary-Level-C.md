[Music]
hello kids welcome back to reading for
vocabulary i'm your host brian stewart
in this lesson we're starting a new
level level c right and in level c we're
talking about a lot of different
subjects we'll talk about science so
some lessons will be about science
some lessons will be about social
studies
some lessons will be about health so
those are important right of course
they're all important
fine arts will also be the subject of
other lessons fine arts like painting
and sculpture and artists right
math
well math is interesting we can take a
look at some lessons about math and a
new subject
entertainment so that will be
interesting too also something new with
level c is that some lessons will have
short videos in them so hopefully that
will be fun and interesting to look at
those so shall we get started with
lesson number one
you bet let's get going okay number one
lesson one we're talking about animals
and our subject of course is science
right especially biology
the study of life
so animals we're going to be looking at
the the name of the unit is in a land
before time actually the name of the
lesson in a land before time what does
that mean
well think about it be when was time
thought of right human beings invented
time so this is like before humans a
long time ago the earth is millions and
millions and millions of years old
humans haven't always been on the earth
so what was the earth like
what kind of animals lived on the earth
before human beings so in this lesson we
can learn about
dinosaurs
from their bones because dinosaurs lived
on the earth a long long long
long
long time before human beings came about
okay let's take a look here we have a
video for you what exactly is a dinosaur
you probably know what a dinosaur is
right there's many uh television shows
animation uh shows and movies about
dinosaurs right you've probably seen
some of those of course a dinosaur is
like a big terrible lizard right it
looks like
like this oh my gosh look at that that's
kind of oh my gosh
look at that that's a huge dinosaur
that's kind of scary isn't it
is he gone
oh he's still there
okay he's gone we got rid of the
dinosaur okay
dinosaurs were really really scary we're
very very lucky that there are no more
dinosaurs because they're huge some
dinosaurs were huge we'll learn more
about dinosaurs in this lesson okay but
as we get started of course we need to
learn some vocabulary let's take a look
the first vocabulary word the definition
a hot
hot place
with a lot of plants so if you think of
a hot place there are many plants there
what do we call that type of environment
we say it is a jungle a jungle and you
can think if you go south or if you go
to southeast asia if you go to vietnam
thailand the philippines those are very
hot places there are many plants there
it's they have many jungles in those
places a hot place with a lot of plants
jungle okay next one
oh this is the opposite of a jungle
right it's very cold there's a lot of
snow on the ground but look at what
happens when somebody walks across the
snow they're making marks so this word
is a mark made by a foot right when a
person or an animal is walking in the
snow
in the sand
in the mud what do they leave behind
them they leave behind them a foot print
foot print footprint
this person is leaving many footprints
behind them remember footprint is
singular hana right if you say footprint
you mean hanuman if you say footprints
you mean
manio right many so
be careful sometimes students will make
that mistake
footprint is only one but you can't
leave just one footprint
unless you're jumping really far right
so you leave footprints behind you
next one oh what's this this looks very
old doesn't it this
of course is the bone around your brain
this is a person's head someone who died
a long time ago
the only thing that's left is the bone
bones last for a long time
skin hair organs those things dissolve
and they go away after somebody dies but
the bone stays for a long time so the
bone around your brain what do we call
this bone we call this bone a skull
now that's a little hard to pronounce
right s k and ll at the end sk
sk
and ll just oh so and we have the u
skull
skull so we say that word as skull now a
lot of times when we see the skull we
think of death right that's a symbol for
death you guys know pirates right the
pirate flag is a skull
and
crossbones
what that means is they take two bones
and they cross them right now i'm not a
very good artist but i'll try to make a
skull now i'll just make the crossbones
i can't really draw a skull am i doing
okay yeah i seem to be doing all okay
it's kind of like a bone here right so
the crossbones so they'll have a flag
and they'll have a skull on the top and
they'll have crossbones skull and
crossbones is a very common flag for
pirates if you see a pirate ship they
have a black flag and a white skull and
crossbones on it so skull is usually
associated with death because pirates
are bad guys right okay
four
the weather conditions in a certain
place
so if you're talking about the weather
conditions it's hot and sunny or it's
cold and snowy how do we one word how do
we describe those conditions with one
word we say what is the climate like
what
is
the oops the
climate
what is the climate
like
right
it's very common if you're talking to a
friend you make a friend on the internet
or with email through your school a
program and you meet a friend in africa
and you want to exchange emails with
that friend or you meet a friend in
finland and you can ask them what is the
climate like in your country the person
in africa will probably say hot and
humid the person in finland will
probably say cold and snowy so what are
the weather conditions
in a certain place
okay
number five
to continue to live if something
continues to live they
endure they
survive right i can't i can't say it
without saying the word right survive
that's a little difficult word to say
remember sir vive it's two sounds one
two
sir
vive
survive so when you put them together
survive one more time
survive so survive means to continue to
live not
die
so if something doesn't die it continues
to live and this is for individuals but
it's also for groups too right of course
individuals die all the time but groups
of animals might survive for a very long
time okay
six
interesting and special
very interesting very special city very
beautiful city right what do we say it's
remarkable now this is a long word right
re
mar
ca bull if you're going to split it up
into sounds you got one two three four
so four syllables re marco
remarkable and you know you remark you
could probably put it there to remark uh
you don't have to say mar remar kabul
but you know it depends on how you
pronounce it so
you can say if you put them all together
it sounds remarkable
remarkable okay one more time remarkable
remarkable interesting and special okay
let's move on to number seven
to keep from being ruined of course if
you leave food open to the air
it will begin to smell it will go bad
but you want to keep it from being
ruined you want to
keep it in its original state are close
to its original state what do you do you
preserve it
preserve so again we have two
sounds preserved now this looks like
serve but don't say pre-serve say
preserve
preserve okay and that is a
verb to keep something from being ruined
to preserve something so you are going
to keep it
in the original state so it doesn't get
old if you want to keep food for a long
time you put it in a can you preserve it
so you can eat it two months later
four months later maybe even a year
later but even food in a can you can't
keep it forever right you gotta eat it
sometime because it will get ruined
after a certain amount of time but you
can preserve it for a long time in a can
eight well it's a strange looking animal
right what animal is this do you know
maybe you learn from history or from
lessons in school what's wrong with this
pen uh oh here we go dodo
it's a dodo bird have you heard of the
dodo bird before the dodo bird uh
well that's weird the dodo bird went
extinct
and that's our word extinct so when
people think of the word extinct
it's very common to think of the dodo
bird it's a very famous bird
that died when human beings came to the
island where it lived extinct means no
longer in existence the human beings
killed all the dodo birds and they
brought dogs with them the dogs also
hunted the birds so in a very short time
all the dodo birds went extinct so we
can use the word
go as past tense right to go
go extinct the dodo bird went extinct
past tense okay
no longer in existence is extinct and
many animals have become extinct
over the history of the earth the
earth's history is very very very very
long and many animals have gone extinct
many types of animals
nine
sometimes of course animals will leave
evidence that they existed and that
evidence is their remains the remains
what is left behind the remains of an
animal or plant so it's an animal or a
plant not just animal but also plants
leave remains and you can find them in
the rocks usually the animal or plant
dies in mud and the mud is compressed
under pressure and that mud becomes rock
well the imprint the imprint of the
animal's body or the plant's body is
left or made into the rock and these are
very neat if you find them what am i
talking about i'm talking about fossils
it's very cool very neat if you find a
fossil in the rock so next time you're
in the country next time you're in
walking through the
mountains or walking through a field and
you see some interesting rocks take a
look at them see if you can find any
fossils who knows maybe you'll find an
interesting fossil
okay next word
this one is to be present in a place
this is a picture it looks like mars of
course many scientists uh have been uh
wondering if water
exists
on mars so if water is present in a
place like water is on mars then water
exists
on mars and of course we now know that
at the north pole and the south pole you
can't see it because the
mars is tilted like this you can't see
the south pole but at the north pole
there's frozen water ice right so there
is water water does exist on mars okay
number 11 a small plant with many
branches so these are very common we see
these around buildings and in parks
people like to grow them because they
form like a small wall so you know
people
don't go over that of course we call it
a bush
a bush now of course these are little
bushes a lot of bushes in a line you
call a hedge
a hedge
right and this is like a hedge it's a
line of bushes that people will make in
a park or near a building to you know
like a little small little wall but
there's as many bushes a small plant
with many branches we call it a bush
not a tree right we can say there's like
two main types of plants we can see
easily one is a tree of course a tree
grows
very big i got a mushroom cloud here
okay
okay that's a tree and then of course
you have a little
little bush
right so a bush and a tree right so uh
we talk about bushes and we talk about
trees those are the two main types of
plants of course you have other types
but usually we see
trees and bushes
number 12
a climbing plant this is another type of
plant a climbing plant what does it mean
a plant that climbs
yes because these
branches or long thin stems right you
can say a branch is like a tree branch
it's very thick and very strong but some
plants are very they have arms or
branches that are very small and they're
very they're not strong you can bend
them and we call those stems okay so
long thin stems and this is a plant with
long thin stems that grow and climb up
walls so it's a climbing plant we call
it a vine
so on some very old buildings especially
old brick buildings you can see that
they're covered with a green plant
because the plant it's called a vine has
grown up and they hook
they've got little hooks on the stems
and they hook onto the wall and they
climb up the wall very nice looking very
neat
13 to wind together so if you take some
dead branches
some stems and you wind them together
like this what are you doing it's a verb
to twist
to wind together you can wind plants
together you can wind your i'm too old i
can't do it you can wind your arms
together right you can wind rope
together you can wind or you can twist
many things so you can twist your arms
you can twist rope you can twist your
hair
you can twist something together or to
wind together
fourteen oh he's having a lot of fun
isn't he don't you wish you could have
fun like that well you can but don't
tell your mom i told you to go out and
play in the mud okay
wet dirt of course i just said it it's
mud
and sometimes in korea i forgot where it
was i'm not sure the name i'm a little
worried if i mispronounce it it's boring
boring
mud festival is that right yeah in korea
you have a mud festival at boryang
boringshi or a bordeaux place i'm not
sure but um many people will go there
and they'll play in the mud right during
the summer it's a nice thing to do it's
cool and it's wet so people you know
it's kind of like water playing in the
water so it's mud
and people will plant it people will
throw it at each other of course
normally don't step in it because if
you're wearing nice clothes your mother
will get angry if you get mud on your
clothes okay
next word an animal that lived long ago
but is now extinct ah that's one of the
words we learned before extinct it
doesn't exist anymore it's gone it did
not survive and of course we saw this
animal before right the video that i was
scared of before that's a scary animal
right of course it is a dinosaur it's an
animal that lived long ago but is now
extinct it doesn't exist anymore
because if it did
we would be in big danger right there
would be too many of them dinosaur
dinosaur three were three sounds
dinosaur
it looks like dinosaur but we say
dinosaur
okay some people can say dinosaur but
most common it's dinosaur dinosaur
okay
another word here a place where you can
see many important things so if you want
to learn about things
that existed
a long long time ago or things that you
know exist now but usually they're from
history and people will take them and
display them in certain buildings what
is that building called it's called a
museum museum
museum
a place where you can see many important
things so here we see uh things from
ancient
excuse me ancient egypt right a long
time ago we can see the mummies right
and you can see mummies in a museum you
can see things from your country that
existed a long time ago in a museum
in natural museums natural history
museums we can see animals that existed
a long time ago in natural history
museums okay
let's go over exercise here the first
exercise has to do with
antonyms
antonym what is an antonym antonym means
oh let's draw that line here a little
bit more slowly antonym means words that
have opposite
opposite
opposite meaning it's like pandero right
pandiro opposite meaning antonym so our
instruction our direction is match the
words in the box
here with their antonyms listed below so
these words are the opposite of these
words that's what we have to do we have
to match the opposites okay
the words are
preserved
right we learned the word preserve we
learned that it was a verb
so now it's used
with an ed so it's past tense like
preserved they have been preserved
next one jungle
jungle next one survive survive
and last one
extinct
extinct
okay what are the opposites of these
words number one is alive what is the
opposite meaning of alive
something that is not alive anymore it's
dead and maybe all of them are dead then
we can say
extinct if they're extinct they're dead
they're gone no more but if they're
alive they continue to exist okay
next one
desert
what is a desert a desert is a hot place
but it has no plants
no plants grow in a desert it's just
dirt or just sand there's no plants so
what's the opposite
of
a desert we could say it's a jungle
because a jungle has many many plants
there's a lot of water in the jungle
there is no water in the desert or very
little water in the desert
three
die
so that's a sad word right die so what's
the opposite of die if something dies
right it doesn't what it doesn't survive
any longer it's not alive right by the
way dying alive those are also antonyms
aren't they
die and survive are also antonyms okay
the last one here ruined if something is
ruined it's been spoiled it has changed
from its original condition but if you
keep something in the original condition
it doesn't change you have preserved it
it's not ruined it is preserved it's not
ruined it's preserved okay so those are
the antonyms the opposite meaning of
these words
now our next exercise is talking about
synonyms right before we talked about
antonyms now we're going to talk about
synonyms what does synonyms mean synonym
is same
the same meaning so a cinnamon is a word
or two words that have the same or
similar pistandeo right maybe not
okay so maybe not exactly the same but
similar meanings okay
same meanings match the words in the box
with their synonyms listed below so
these words in the box we need to match
them with the word that has the same or
similar
meaning
similar
so same or similar meaning okay let's
look at the words in the box first we
have
skull
skull
next word
footprints
footprints
the next word is remarkable
remarkable the next one is
climate climate
okay now we have to match these words in
the box to the same or similar meanings
of these words here the first word is
amazing amazing it's really amazing it
amazes you it impresses you it's really
exceptional
what do we say is a similar meaning we
would say of course remarkable
remarkable is similar to amazing if you
think wow that's amazing it is
remarkable okay the similar meaning
number two is head okay so head
not the same meaning but similar meaning
for head what's in your head right what
is that bone there we could say it's the
skull so skull isn't the same as head
but it is similar similar skull and head
are similar
three
weather so we're talking about the
weather in a certain place especially
we're talking about what what word has
to do with weather of course this word
means weather climate so climate weather
is climate
okay the last one is
marks
now when we learned this word in the
vocabulary we said marks that are left
by feet right if somebody's walking
along especially in the snow or the sand
they leave marks in the snow or the sand
what do we call those marks we call
those marks
yogitta
right here footprints right sorry
we call them footprints okay so marks
are footprints
that we leave behind us
by our feet
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
section
we're going to take a short break here
we'll come back and look at the reading
so don't go away
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading

so smart as a chimp a chimp is a
chimpanzee we're gonna focus on

course a chimpanzee is this animal here
we'll look at that word later on and
that of course brings us to our
vocabulary okay and then our first word
is very funny word right what's going on
here
right
right that's what you say
to make someone laugh by touching them
touching them not just touching them
right but by touching them like this
especially on the bottom of their feet
what's going on
tickle to tickle somebody
i'm going to tickle you right so if you
see these feet you can say ha ha i'm
going
to
tickle
i'm going to tickle
you
so you see somebody's feet
i'm going to tickle you right okay and
you tickle somebody you make them laugh
okay next one
to stick to something of course to stick
to something especially to hold on to
something right these these uh kids are
holding on to the tree they're sticking
to the tree especially the one on the
bottom
the the kid on the top just sitting on
the tree but the the child on the bottom
what's going on
cling
the child is clinging to the tree to
hold on to to stick to something to
cling to something
so we have cling
clung clunk because cling
is an irregular verb it changes form for
the past tense cling
clung
cling clung clung
okay next word
whoa this looks very dangerous
especially i'm worried about his neck
very dangerous
to fight by grabbing and throwing so
when you grab somebody and you throw
them or you hold them down you try to
push them down on the floor what type of
fighting are they doing there's lots of
different fighting right there's martial
arts like taekwondo right there's
punching like boxing what are these guys
doing they're wrestling to wrestle
wrestle that's a little bit of a
difficult word you have w.r
[Music]
wrestle and it's tle you don't say tulla
right we say wrestle wrestle it's like
you don't even pronounce the t
wrestle the t is silent
but they are wrestling
and yeah they got to be careful that
looks very dangerous okay
four very smart oh he's i want to tickle
his feet right oh just kidding okay but
he's very smart maybe he read all these
books i don't know but somebody who's
very smart we say they are
intelligent
really long word if you can say that
word then you are intelligent right
intelligent intelligent
intelligent
somebody who's intelligent they're very
smart but be careful intelligent is
really ability
ability
if you are intelligent it means you are
able to learn quickly and of course
that's you have smarts you have uh you
are smart and you are able to learn
things quickly i hope so right because
studying can be hard but if you're
intelligent you can study quickly and
learn things quickly
next one
having lots of hair so if something has
a lot of hair we say it's furry
now we may have learned this word before
fur fur is just a lot of hair on a
on a body of you know
an animal
animals have fur so they have a lot of
fur if they have a lot of fur then you
can say you can make it an adjective
this is an adjective right adjective
furry
he has fur fur is a noun make it an
adjective it becomes furry so my dog is
very furry a bear is very furry okay
furry
i'm not furry i hope not
no i just have maybe hair in my my arms
but i'm not furry people aren't furry
animals are furry okay
oh what's going on here this is a big
subah no it's not watermelon it's
somebody's stomach right lower stomach
what else do we call it
by the way just how to say that okay
we say it's belly and i said pecop right
pekkop is right here right looks like a
little eye is looking at the boy but
pecop in english we say belly
button
so we use that word belly belly belly is
kind of a casual word uh you know kids
use it belly uh stomach is more of a
formal word doctors will use stomach
parents will use stomach but you know if
you're speaking casually with your
friends and belly so
you know belly like a big belly like me
right okay
okay so belly and this of course
everybody has a belly button you have a
belly button that's what we call it
there
belly when we use it in the plural we
change y to i
and e s at the end belize right so if
many people you're talking about many
people they have many bellies okay belly
okay
a small stick if we're looking at a
small stick a very small stick maybe
this long maybe this long it's very thin
we can say that it is a twig a twig is
another word for a small stick english
is very descriptive isn't it we have a
lot of specific words for very uh unique
or very special types of things stick is
like an umbrella word you know you have
long sticks short sticks you know thick
sticks thin sticks but a twig is a
special kind of stick it means short and
thin it's a twig you can hold it easily
what is this guy doing is he crazy okay
what is he yelling at his golf club
a feeling he has strong emotions
maybe he's very upset because he hit the
ball and it went the wrong way so
instead of thinking oh i made a mistake
he blames his golf club he's very has a
very strong emotion towards his golf
club but remember emotions aren't just
negative emotions can be positive too
happiness is an emotion if you're really
really happy that's an emotion if you're
really really sad that's also an emotion
there are many kinds of emotions
emotions can be positive
and they can be negative
so emotion isn't a positive or negative
word it just means all of those emotions
it's like an umbrella word for that okay
oh look at this chimp he's dancing right
it's a cool chimp
okay
an animal that looks like a monkey i
just said the word it's a chimpanzee now
notice that at the beginning of the
lesson it said smart as a chimp because
chimpanzee
which is the whole name is a lot of
times people will shorten it and just
say chimp right i went to see a chimp at
the zoo
chimps are very smart so we can say
chimpanzee
chimpanzee
or we can just say
chimp it means the same thing it's an
animal that looks like a monkey actually
it is a monkey it's a type of monkey
okay
ten
thinking much or thinking a lot about
what you are doing when you're thinking
a lot about what you're doing
you are being very careful right you're
being very careful this person's being
very careful looking at the bugs right
when you think a lot about what you're
doing you do it carefully you should
think a lot about the things you are
doing do things carefully some things
you don't have to think a lot about like
you know you know uh well brushing your
teeth you have to do it carefully think
about how you brush your teeth but
sometimes we don't do things very
carefully we don't think about them
because it's habit or we do them many
times but if we do something and we
think about it very deeply then we're
doing it carefully okay
eleven oh
that's a sad situation
pain in the stomach ah pay up by all
right all money
what do we call that you say i have
such a long word it gives me a headache
to think about it okay
stomach ache and notice i just said
headache now there's a lot of aches that
you can have there are a lot of eggs you
can have a headache right you can have
uh
a stomachache you can have a backache so
we use ache
for with different parts of the body
right
to say that they hurt not always right
don't say i have a nose ache that
doesn't work right it's usually headache
backache you could have a toothache
toothache
toothache it's one word i'm just showing
the difference and stomachache right
those are commonly the words we use with
ache don't say have an elbow ache or an
arm ache that's weird you could say i
have an ache in my arm i have an ache in
my elbow or you could probably just say
my
ain't hurts
it hurts my arm hurts my elbow hurts my
tooth hurts

walking along ow
your thumb you bang your thumb against
the table oh oppai oh right don't say oh
my thumb is sick huh your thumb is sick
oh poor thumb go to bed and drink some
orange juice that's crazy right you

don't say my stomach is sick oh poor
stomach go to bed no you say i have a
stomach ache or my stomach hurts don't

now notice we say stomach ache before we
learned belly so you can also say
bellyache right i have a bellyache or my

[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary i'm brian stewart we're
going over lesson three here lesson
three is what's after seven
what's after seven dinner
no we're talking about math right so
when we talk about what's after seven
we're talking about counting right so
did you know there is an elephant that
can count so we talk about count one two
three four five
six seven
what's after seven
i don't know oh alright it's eight right
what's after seven it's eight okay so of
course it depends on what you're talking
about what's after seven oh dinner time
no we're talking about math counting so
what's after seven it's eight okay so
that's we're going to learn about in
this lesson something very interesting
about an animal an elephant that can
count that's very strange right well
let's get right away let's go into the
vocabulary that we need to know these
words in order to study the reading
passage later on
now the first word we have is
to find something
to find something now that's an
interesting picture looks like a scuba
diver just came up and he found
something on the bottom of the ocean
what did he do he discovered something
he discovered something by the way
doesn't he look familiar yeah he's a
famous actor matthew mcconaughey okay
maybe you've seen him in a movie before
but in this movie he discovered
something at the bottom of the ocean so
when you find something you discover it
okay next word
well we have many apples here many green
apples there's one red apple to change
one thing for another so let's say this
person says okay i'm going to take the
the red apple and i'm going to put a
green apple in its place
in this case you could say switch
they're going to switch apples right so
they switch this red apple they take it
out and they put a green one in its
place that means you switched them to
switch
okay number three
oh person is doing exercise can you do
this exercise
uh it's called a push-up by the way
that's not the word but just so you know
this is called a push-up push-up she's
doing push-ups right you could do
sit-ups right this is a push-up but when
you do push-ups you don't just do one
right you do them again you
basically you repeat the exercise right
so you say i can do push-ups one i'm
done no you have to repeat right do it
ten times right do one push-up two
push-ups three push-ups you repeat you
do again so when you exercise you do the
exercise again you repeat the exercise
many times
number four very smart girl right she's
going to be a chemist when she grows up
she's studying chemistry
now chemist by the way how do you say
that chemist
chemist a chemist is a type of scientist
what do scientists do
they have tests to see what happens
scientists have many questions about the
world so they have many tests to see
what will happen if they do something
and we call that another word for that
test is called an oh this is a really
long word experiment
so long right experiment
so how many sounds ex
beer e meant
for sounds
ex beer uh meant let's put them all
together
experiment
experiment
so an experiment
is specifically what a scientist like a
chemist
does to see what happens it's a test a
type of test a very specific type of
test there are many kinds of tests you
take a test in school that's not an
experiment
an experiment is when a scientist
does something to see what will happen
that's an experiment okay next one
oh this is a very interesting picture
isn't it
to choose now it's important to choose
wisely right
you see this picture here this person
chose a hamburger
you see
this person chose an apple
you see
very important to choose the right thing
person who chose a hamburger is kind of
fat right
but this person who chose the apple
they're slim they're not so fat they're
in good shape okay but you choose
something another word to choose is to
select you select one thing or the other
thing will you select a hamburger
then you will look like me right
if you select the apple you'll look like
i did 20 years ago
okay so depending on what you choose
that's important depending on what you
select what will you select okay
next one
a container for holding something this
is a container there are many different
kinds of containers that hold things
right
this is a special type of container it
holds water it has a
handle that you can carry it we call
this container a bucket a bucket is
usually used to carry water
or sand
or something else and you can
many buckets have a handle
that you can carry it around with okay
buckets are good for carrying heavy
things but we call this type of
container a bucket they're made of metal
or plastic so plastic bucket metal
bucket
this one's made of metal
next one oh
what's he doing he looks familiar he's
teaching right
a university teacher but he's not just a
teacher right in your elementary school
your middle school your high school you
can call those
uh people teachers but at a university
they have a special word for that type
of teacher they call them professor
professor professor
professor that's the word for a teacher
who teaches at a university you don't
call your teacher in high school a
professor you just say teacher but when
you go to college or you go to
university then you say professor okay
next one there's a group of people here
they look very surprised to surprise
someone greatly now when you surprise
someone greatly especially it means you
scare them a little bit right that means
you shock them oh my gosh
right you say oh i am shocked right you
surprised someone really a lot to shock
them
he shocked them okay next one
now she looks a little frustrated right
something that is wrong something of
course with computers many things go
wrong right so we can say it is a
mistake okay hopefully she didn't make
the mistake maybe the computer made the
mistake but anyway something went wrong
something wrong happened it is a mistake
so it's a mistake
okay next one
to make it difficult for someone to
think clearly
this person is buried under many a lot
of work right they have so many things
to do it's difficult for them to think
clearly they are confused they don't
know what to do should i do this job
should i do this job or the phone's
ringing my boss is calling me
i'm confused right to confuse
confuse
confuse
confuse i'm very confused i don't know
what to do
eleven
well this guy's pretty smart right he's
doing what is he doing well the study of
numbers he's figuring out
uh how to
not just add and subtract but also
multiply and divide he's studying math
did you hear what i said add
subtract
that's simple math right if you add and
subtract that's simple math add is like
plus or minus but i also said multiply
multiply oops multiply
and
divide that's more difficult math right
that's multiply we usually use that
symbol and to divide we use that symbol
okay so
add subtract multiply divide this is all
the study of math and the type of math
he's doing is algebra this is algebra
there are many types of math right there
are many types of math there's simple
math doing this there's algebra there's
trigonometry there's calculus ooh
calculus is very difficult right but
algebra probably you will study algebra
maybe you're studying algebra now
oh by the way isn't this picture a
little strange think about it
he's writing but he's writing backwards
he's writing backwards so you can see
what he's writing but if you look at the
picture closely you see oh something
strange about the picture by the way
it's also interesting to notice you know
i'm just getting on to some of these b
equals 2. if you do these problems these
problems work out and if i'll just give
you the answer
a what does a equal a equals 5. look at
it later okay we're studying words now
but if you want to look at the math a
equals five do it later okay
twelve
intelligent somebody who's intelligent
okay
what do we call them we call them smart
are you smart of course you're smart
you're studying with me right i'm sorry
you're studying with these textbooks
so you will you're smart right because
you're intelligent um
if you know a lot of things it's
interesting to
look at this word intelligent and smart
intelligent doesn't mean that you have a
lot of knowledge
intelligence means that you can learn
quickly you can learn the knowledge
there's a difference between being
intelligent and being wise
if somebody is wise that means they have
a lot of experience
and they know
from life what to do but somebody who's
intelligent has the ability intelligent
is like ability
ability
to learn and if you're smart you can
learn quickly okay so that's interesting
13 with no error with no error no
mistakes you've got it
perfectly or exactly exactly correct
that's like
that's like exactly perfect
exactly right right no problems no
errors okay
next one why something happened oh no
it's too bad she got an f i eagle
it's there's some reason what is the
reason she got an f the reason explains
why something happened
we we don't know but we can think there
are many reasons why she got an f one
she didn't sleep last night two she
didn't study three she played a video
game all night
there are many reasons why something
happened many reasons why somebody would
get an f so
i hope that doesn't happen to you make
sure there is no reason for you to get
an f there should only be a reason for
you to get an a
okay
number 15 to make a point in a test or a
game to make a point or when you look at
the points for both teams or for people
we're talking about the score so when we
use the word score a very common
question is
what
is
the
score so
imagine
korea and japan are playing a soccer
game right and you want to know what is
the score then of course you say well
korea has eight points and japan has
zero right that's the score eight to
zero eight to zero okay
maybe okay what's the score what are the
points that each team got or each person
got that's the score when we talk about
the score we usually talk about both
teams eight to zero okay or you could
say what is your score on a test because
it's also a test my score was 89.
that's pretty good but it's better if
your score is a hundred right
that's a perfect score so hopefully you
get a hundred okay that would be a score
on a test okay
the next word to think that something is
true so if you think something is true
you
believe in something in this case we
have a picture of santa claus do you
believe in santa claus of course in that
case you think that santa claus is real
and it's true
um that to believe something to think
that something is true you believe in
something okay
okay well let's go over the vocabulary
exercises exercise number one what is
our directions complete each sentence
with a word from the box so we have
eight words in the box we're gonna have
eight sentences to fill in the blanks
each sentence we have to choose which
word goes into the blank for the
sentence we have a lot of words what are
they of course these are words we just
studied the first one is
discovered
discovered remember we studied the word
discover but now we're using it in the
past tense discovered
okay
bucket we learned singular bucket more
than one bucket is buckets
buckets
okay next one
repeat to do over repeat but this one is
repeated
repeated okay next one
we learned shock but remember we can say
shocked
shocked
okay next one
experiment there's a really long word
right experiment
experiment okay next one
switch
switch okay
switch that might be a little difficult
with the sw you exchange or you move one
for the other
switch
select
select ted okay selected
selected
next one professor
professor
okay those are the words let's see
if we can put these into these sentences
correctly i hope so number one he will
beep
the old bucket with a new one
so think about that we have two things
here right we have an old bucket we have
a new one so we have two buckets we have
an old bucket and a new bucket what were
you what are we going to do we're going
to take the old bucket maybe throw it
away and we're going to use the new
bucket so what are we doing in this case
right we're taking one removing it and
putting another one in its place
so in that case we are going to switch
switch he will
switch the old bucket with a new one and
this is probably what you do in your
life too if you have something that's
old or broken you throw it away or you
get rid of it and you put a new one
instead for example batteries you switch
the battery in your phone don't throw
away your old battery recharge it but
maybe you have two batteries so you
switch them the new battery for the old
one you recharge the old one that's a
good example switch switch batteries
two the beep wants to give the elephant
a math test
okay that's an interesting sentence
that's part of the reading by the way
okay so if somebody wants to give a
elephant a math test who would do that
right think about that and we need a
person right the professor wants to give
the elephant a math test basically
that's the only one that we can use here
because professor is a person right and
that's the only person we've got up here
so the professor wants to give the
elephant a math test
okay number two
the workers beep gold and diamonds in
the cave
what do the workers do they
there's gold and diamonds in a cave
how do they
what are they going to do with those
things now
not all caves have gold and diamonds too
bad right if you go to a cave there's
probably not going to be golden diamonds
in there but if you're looking around oh
look if you find the golden diamonds
there what did you do you discovered
gold and diamonds in the cave okay so
discovered they discovered golden
diamonds they found golden diamonds in
the cave okay the next one
they beep the same test three times
three times
they did it three times not just once
but they did it again and again and one
more time again okay so what word means
that you do something not just once
but twice or three times or four times
right what means that you do something
more than once that's this word right
here repeated they repeated the same
test three times okay that's the word
that makes sense there
number five
fill the beep with water from the well
ah okay remember we looked at this
container that holds something and it's
usually this container is made of metal
or plastic and of course i said you
usually use it to carry water or sand or
something that's heavy
what is it what is that container that
we use to carry stuff ah there it is
right there bucket fill the buckets with
water from the well okay
the next one six the scientist is doing
and what in the lab what do scientists
do remember before i talked about a
scientist has
many questions about the world they want
to
make tests
to see if the question is yes or no
will this thing burn if i increase the
temperature that is what that is an
experiment the scientist is doing an
experiment in the lab okay
our last two sentences
a shia
a shia is a name it's the name of the
elephant in the reading passage that
we're going to read ashia
beep the one with more apples in it so
if you've read the passage already what
did a shia the elephant do a shia the
elephant right there's one with more
apples so you think there's more than
one right you've got one here you've got
one here maybe there's two or three or
four in the reading they talk about just
two but she is going to right take or
pick
or
what what is she gonna do what is the
elephant gonna do the elephant is going
to select as she has selected the one
with more apples in it select choose
okay
number eight
are you beep that an elephant can count
so
the fact that an elephant can count
that's really surprising isn't it that's
really amazing and it might be so
surprising that right it's like oh my
gosh i can't believe it right
it what means that what word has
something to do with something that you
find out that you discover and it's
really surprising some really surprising
information what word has to do with
that well of course shocked are you
shocked that an elephant can count did
you know that that's really shocking
news that's amazing news okay well that
wraps up the exercise for the vocabulary
and we've learned a lot of different
words so now we're going to use those
we're going to see those words in a
reading passage so we're going to take a
short break come back and look at the
reading passage
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary are you ready to continue
with the lessons great because we're
going to be starting today with lesson
four the unit title is
dynamic earth and our lesson title is
fire under the earth do you know there's
a fire under the earth we're going to
talk about that in this lesson so we
will focus on
let's learn about a volcano do you know
what a volcano is well we have a video
here of what a volcano looks like i'm
sure you've seen them on television
right here we have a mountain as you can
see and look at this there's fire
coming out of the mountain let's look at
the video okay wow look at that all of
this fire is coming out from the top of
the mountain where is it coming from
well it's coming from deep below the
surface of the earth and that's what our
lesson is about today now before we get
into uh too much into the lesson of
course we have to review some important
vocabulary words so let's begin with the
first one
the first one we have a picture here
this looks like yellowstone national
park which is a park a very famous park
in america
where hot water
comes out of the ground it comes out
very suddenly and in great volume it
suddenly comes up
shoots up into the sky now there is a
very specific verb we can use to
describe exactly that action what is
that verb that verb is
gush
to
gush so we used to gush to explain when
something suddenly and in a lot of
volume comes out
not just of the earth you know sometimes
people
gush too
do you have a friend who talks very fast
and very quickly and they say a whole
lot of stuff they are gushing so you can
say my friend gushes right that means
that they're talking very quickly
and they are saying many things very
suddenly so
many things gush right of course in this
lesson we're going to be talking about
things that gush from up under the earth
okay let's move on to the next word
here we have some three pictures or a
picture of three objects right and it
says water or oil but really to be
honest it's not just water or oil it's
any substance that doesn't have a shape
that you can pour into a container you
can pour out of a container if you pour
it out it flows over the ground or it
goes into the ground
what type of
substance is that we say that that is
liquid
liquid right liquid it's liquid water is
liquid oil is liquid
that video that we saw of the volcano
that's actually
liquid rock
isn't that amazing rock can be liquid
we'll talk about that some more later
okay the next one wow this looks very
very very old doesn't it when we look at
something like this these are ruins
right
ruins from a very very old civilization
you've probably read about rome or a
long long time ago in china or even in
korea we can see ruins they're very old
another word for very old it's an
adjective that we use it's ancient
ancient it's a little bit maybe a
difficult word so ain't
chant
ancient
ancient these are ancient ruins
okay let's move on
wow very neat picture that's really cool
looking isn't it very beautiful right
here of course we can see another
volcano this is another volcano here and
actually we can see many volcanoes right
to throw out violently if something is
being thrown out violently what do we
say we say it's erupting to erupt when a
volcano begins to throw out
that very hot rock and smoke and ash
and also ash ashes you know when you
have a fire and the smoke goes out
sometimes pieces of the of the smoke
fall from the sky onto your arm right
that's ash it's actually pieces of the
wood that fly up in the air and come
down on your arm so ash
all of this stuff smoke ash molten rock
is thrown
out of the volcano when the volcano
erupts
okay
next word
now we're talking a lot right i keep
talking about the hot melted rock but
there's a better word for it right
there's a better word for it the hot
melted rock that comes out of a volcano
we have a specific word for it what is
it it's called
lava right before i taught you ash
that's one of the things that comes out
of a volcano the other one is smoke and
finally we have lava lava is very
dangerous isn't it
it's it's also difficult to pronounce
lava lava okay it's hot melted rock
imagine
rock that is so hot
it's red and it's liquid
don't go near that it's really dangerous
right so you should not be close to a
volcano when it erupts right
because if the lava touches you
that's really dangerous so you don't
want to be close to the lava okay
here's a cute picture
what's going on with this kitten right
it's a kitten a baby cat a kitten so it
was born
not long ago
another word for not long ago we can say
recently
recently so when we add l y it's an
adverb it describes you know when it
happened recently recent well how recent
it was recently okay so recently means
it was not long ago recently a little
bit difficult pronunciation re sent lee
recently
recently remember recent
is just an adjective recently add ly to
say answer the question how how was it
right recently
okay
number whoa what's wrong with this lady
she looks very strange while she has
many arms right well what this picture
is showing is that she has many things
to do
she's very very busy isn't she to be
busy doing something so
unfortunately she doesn't have six arms
right maybe she wishes she had six arms
but she's very busy she's doing many
things so she is very active
active if somebody is active that means
that they're busy or that they are doing
something
by the way what's the opposite of active
you could say
passive
when we talk about people people are
active or sometimes people are passive
that means sit back sometimes
you were passive right oh you had a long
day at school you go home oh i just want
to rest i want to watch tv you are being
passive we use active and passive for
people
but we also use active for volcanoes
if a volcano is active that means it can
erupt
soon but we don't say we don't really
use passive for volcanoes if a volcano
is dead and it will not erupt then we
say it's dormant
dormant so dormant is used for volcano
a volcano is dormant it's a little
strange to say a volcano is passive
people are passive volcanoes are dormant
okay let's move on
number eight sleeping now this is our
word here dormant that i just taught you
right we say people are passive but we
say volcanoes
are dormant and it says sleeping here so
you know volcanoes aren't really awake
right they're not really sleeping
they're either active or they're dormant
okay of course in this picture this
volcano has been dormant looks like it's
been dormant for a long time it has snow
on it or maybe it's just winter right
and there's a lot of snow there but this
volcano is not active it's not
erupting so it's dormant
sometimes people can say that volcano is
sleeping but that's kind of a poetic way
to describe it it's kind of like oh the
mountains are sleeping the forest is
sleeping but usually the technical or
scientific word is dormant
okay next one
hot melted rock found inside the earth
we saw this picture before when you see
this picture do you remember the word we
just learned a little a few seconds ago
lava
well
this is different this
word is magma so magma is hot melted
rock found inside the earth and you're
probably thinking right now
what's the difference between lava and
magma it's a good question right
the the difference is
location
location
in other words where is it
this one says found inside the earth if
it's underground if it's deep inside the
earth we say it's magma
but when the magma comes to the surface
when it comes out of the volcano now
it's in a different location it's on the
surface and then it is
lava
okay so maybe let me do this differently
a surface
if it's on the surface
it is
lava
but if it is inside the earth it is
magma so it all depends on the location
where is it on the surface lava inside
the earth magma so we have different
words for depending on whether it
whether where it is on where it is okay
number 10 wow
where is that that's not on earth that's
on the moon right
the outside of an object but when we
talk about the moon of course the
astronauts didn't go in the moon right
they walked where they walked on the
surface
on the surface on
the surface of the moon right on the
surface of the moon on the surface of
the earth we don't live in earth right
we live on the earth right we live on
the surface of the earth okay so the
outside of an object is the surface
okay
next one a mountain with a hole in the
top a mountain with a hole in the top
we've already talked about this word
i've used it several times already of
course we're talking about a volcano
volcano we don't really pronounce the l
you don't say volcano you say
volcano
volcano okay so of course we're talking
about this it's a mountain there's a
hole in the top and smoke ash and lava
come out of the volcano erupt
okay
number 12.
if you're looking at a map let's say
you're here and you want to go there
well that's not far away it's not far
right if it's far it's um right buddha
but it's kakawayo right not far away we
say
nearby
nearby nearby or you could also say
close it's close
it's nearby
it is
close it is nearby
where is the post office oh don't worry
it's nearby it's close it's not far
away right okay next one
a scientist do you want to be a
scientist like this this looks like an
exciting job looking and studying the
heavens
this is a scientist who studies outer
space of course there are many many
scientists
scientists study different things
some scientists study life they're
biologists some scientists study the
earth they're geologists but this is a
scientist who studies outer space
right out the moon the planets the stars
what do we call that scientist
we call that scientist an astronomer
that's a big word right
astronomer
astronomer
astronomer so we say astronomer is a
scientist who studies outer space
okay
number fourteen
this is a fun thing to do in the
summertime maybe you go to kwanghwa moon
in seoul or city hall and they have a
fountain
coming from the sidewalk right
and that's very fun to play in in the
summer time well a stream of water going
into the air i just said it it's a
fountain
fountain
fountain okay two sounds found ten a
fountain and many kids like to play in
the fountain during the summer okay so
the next word here we have a picture of
of a very hot liquid and it's something
that wasn't liquid before to become
liquid by heating now before we've
talked about rock rock being so hot it
turns into a liquid that's really
amazing isn't it but if you think about
it everything on the earth all the
material you can think of if you heat it
up
at a high temperature it turns from a
solid
into
a liquid it goes from solid to
liquid now what word do we use to
describe this action we say
melt to melt
lt at the end alt
melt
melt so if something melts it turns from
a solid to a liquid it becomes liquid by
a lot of heat
we can see melting every day if it's a
hot summer day and you have ice cubes in
your water those ice cubes will melt so
ice melts very easily
ice cream melts easily you have to eat
it quickly right now don't eat it too
quickly right but ice cream will melt
sometimes people like the melted ice
cream that's also good okay this is our
last word and look at the picture wow it
makes you
really sleepy right it's like pyeonghan
right very peaceful there's nobody no
people in the picture all we can see is
just like an empty dock the boat is
empty nobody's there
the sea is very calm everything is very
peaceful and what
quiet
without much noise or activity so
imagine if you're there you don't hear
much noise maybe a little bit of noise
from the water but it's soothing it's
peaceful there's no activity nobody's
running around or making noise the waves
are very calm it's very quiet very quiet
scene very peaceful okay it's time to
begin the exercises for the vocabulary
in this exercise it says exercise two
we're skipping exercise one right to
exercise two we're using a paragraph so
we're looking at a paragraph and we need
to complete the paragraph there are
blanks in the paragraph we need to
choose the right word to put in the
blank to finish the paragraph okay so
what are our words we have five words
here first one is gush
gush
next
erupt
erupt
next one active
active
the next one
dormant
dormant
and the final one
liquid
liquid those are our five words we have
to choose which word is the best to put
into these blanks
let's take a look the first sentence
have you ever seen a volcano
then we have a blank
we're looking probably for a verb here
because have you ever seen a volcano do
something
well what do volcanoes do right we
talked about that which well first of
all if we look at our words only two of
them are verbs right
and the two verbs are gush and erupt
does a volcano gush or does it erupt
remember before we talked about a
volcano erupts
okay
so a volcano or uh something that's a
geological
uh formation like a volcano
erupts
that erupts it doesn't gush right that's
a different meaning we'll see that next
actually so have you ever seen a volcano
erupt it's an amazing thing to see this
is all connected it's all one paragraph
so have you ever seen it have you ever
seen a volcano erupt maybe you've seen
one erupt on television or in the movies
i don't think you've seen one erupt in
real life that's kind of rare thank
goodness but anyway you've probably seen
a volcano erupt on the television or in
the movies it's amazing if you do see a
volcano erupt in real life wow it's
really incredible but of course be
careful right
pay attention to what the police and
people tell you about active volcanoes
anyway it's an amazing thing to see
i like watching the lava beep out from
the top so the lava what does the lava
do right we have two verbs here right i
said we have two verbs gush and erupt
are both verbs we used erupt we need
another verb here it's going to be gush
right
now that's interesting think about this
for a minute volcanoes don't gush they
erupt
lava doesn't erupt
it gushes
what's the difference what's going on a
volcano is the thing right it's the
geological feature it explodes it erupts
okay it doesn't gush what what the the
substance that comes out of it that's
what gushes okay so the lava gushes or
before on the slide we saw before at the
very beginning we saw water coming out
of the ground the water was coming out
of a geyser
a geyser
is similar in this sense to a volcano of
course a geyser is in a big mountain
it's a hole in the ground where water
comes out of
the geyser erupts
water gushes so you see the thing
whether it's a volcano or a geyser
that's the geological thing
object it erupts
the substance that comes out
that gushes so that's a good difference
that's a good thing to remember okay the
lava looks like beep fire
what kind of fire is it active dormant
or liquid fire remember when we saw the
video it looked like the rock looked
like a what liquid
it looked like a liquid so the lava
looks like liquid fire
it's like a liquid that is on fire and
actually it's very dangerous it is a
liquid and if you touch it your skin
will become on fire so don't touch lava
don't get near lava okay so those are
our words have you ever seen a volcano
erupt
it's an amazing thing to see
i like watching the lava gush out from
the top the lava looks like liquid fire
continuing on the slide but i've only
seen lava once
that's because most volcanoes aren't are
not
what okay so think about this
i said it's rare to see a volcano erupt
because
most volcanoes are not
what if a volcano is erupting is it is
it
active or is it passive most volcanoes
are not
active and that's a good thing right
we don't want most volcanoes to be
active because that would be dangerous
for the people around the volcano most
volcanoes aren't active most of them are
what
what's the opposite pandero of active
the opposite of active is
dormant
dormant so most volcanoes are not active
they don't erupt they're dormant they
are like sleeping they don't uh have any
action they are quiet
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
exercises let's take a short break and
we'll come back and do the reading
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary i'm brian stewart we're
going over lesson five now the title for
lesson five is never a warm day
never a warm day well obviously we're
not talking about korea because korea
has many warm days right that's good
right we don't want to be cold all the
time but we're talking about a place
that never has a warm day so we're going
to focus on let's learn about the arctic
in the arctic there's never a warm day
it's always cold so we're talking about
geography that falls under social
studies
well first of all let's talk about the
arctic as you can see it's very cold in
the arctic right very cold
never a warm day it never gets very warm
there it's always covered with snow and
ice and the animals that live there are
used to the cold weather in the arctic
okay let's begin with our vocabulary
frost just jumped on up in there right a
covering of ice so when it's really cold
outside right and you can see the plants
or the grass the trees are covered with
a very thin covering of ice we call that
frost
frost is on the grass frost is on the
trees
frost is on your windows sometimes okay
so it's a thin covering of ice that
covers things when it's very cold
number two well she's very she must be a
famous person right she looks like a
famous singer
liked by many people of course i just
gave you the answer famous or popular i
said famous before it's a synonym it
means the same thing famous
popular
many people like that person or thing it
is popular or it is
famous
okay
number three
now imagine if you lived here
this is your dog and you live at a home
near here the only way to get to your
home is by boat
wow
that is a far away place or remote
it is remote remote means far away or
hard to get to right if you live in an
island you can't drive a car there right
there's no roads you have to take a boat
it's far away from a city so it's hard
to get to it's remote remote
remote
okay next word
what is she doing
it's very strange isn't it this
woman is not common she's not behaving
in a normal common way it's not common
if it's not common it's
unusual
she's being very unusual here most
people don't eat their keyboards i don't
recommend you
to eat your keyboard i don't recommend
that as a good practice so it's very
unusual for someone to eat their
keyboard we can also use another word
maybe you've heard before
weird
right she's being weird
strange
unusual okay she's not common okay next
one
uh
do we have a nice picture here okay
of a fortune teller to say that
something will happen in the future now
the word i used to describe her
for
june teller
in korea
this is kind of a popular thing
especially if you go to the old parks
around in seoul or some of the places i
think you say in korean champion right
champion i don't know if you say say
right that is a fortune teller someone
who says what will happen in the future
now what do they do what do fortune
tellers do what do chom jangi what do
they do
they predict
predict predict
they say what's going to happen in the
future
is it true
well you have to you have to think about
that right you have to judge for
yourself can you predict the future okay
next one

gives off light light bulbs in her house
give off light what are they doing they
are shining to shine
shine
not sign shine sh shh
don't not be quiet but shine to shine
means to give off light to give off
light is to shine now shine is an
irregular verb so we say shine shown

past
okay number seven oh my gosh i feel

it's very cold frigid
eight
something that is completely
different
something that's different so some
people
say incinerator is good other people say
incinerator no thank you we don't want
it so you have two sides you have maybe
a pro and a con
you have what other type of sides you
can say
opposite opposite sides these people are
on the opposite side right
opposite
opposite opposite so
if an argument you know you have some
people saying it's good another person
say it's bad these are opposite sides
okay
number nine
a person who visits a place for pleasure
where is this this looks like it's in
venice italy you can tell by the stripes
on the shirts that's their trademark
also of course they have the canals that
go through the city looks like venice a
person but if you go to venice and you
go there to look around wow it's really
cool people get by on boats look at the
buildings look at the uh the food let's
let's experience a new place for
pleasure for entertainment then you call
that person a tourist you are a tourist
if you go to these places for pleasure
to travel for pleasure that is a tourist
okay next one
i'm sure you have some of these in your
room right i hope you do because books
are good right and a book of stories for
children
we can call those what a book of stories
we just use this word and we use this
word and we put them together what do we
have we have a story book so a storybook
of course is a book of stories it has a
story or several stories in it it's a
storybook
next one
an area of the earth
so an area of the earth especially
farmers use this to grow crops what do
we call it of course it's land they need
land to grow food
so an area of the earth is land
the area around the north pole now it's
maybe a little hard to see but if you
look closely you can start to recognize
some of the shapes here this is north
america here
this is greenland
greenland it's not green it's white but
we don't say white land we say green
land
that's history okay the green land and
of course here we have the top of asia
this is russia around here korea's down
over here right so what were we looking
at we're looking at the area around the
north pole what do we call that area
there's a special word for it we already
talked about it it's called the arctic
arctic we don't say really we don't
really pronounce that c we don't say
arctic
that's
we say arctic arctic we don't really
pronounce the sea it's not arctic it's
arctic arctic
okay arctic
that's the area around the north pole
it's very cold up there
next one in the place of something or
somebody in the place of something or
somebody it's kind of a difficult word
it is instead
instead of right so instead of cars
these people are riding bicycles right
and instead of bicycles these people are
riding cars so in the place of something
or somebody
if you say not this one but another
thing instead of this then that
okay next one
number 14 what we ride over snow and ice
now in the arctic it's very cold
you can't really make a road because it
snows too much if you make a road after
a month you can't see the road anymore
because it's covered with snow so people
don't have cars they use these things
to move around what are they called
they're called sleds a sled
maybe you have a sled when it gets cold
in the winter time you might take a sled
to the hill and ride down the sled for
fun a lot of kids do that they ride a
sled over snow in the arctic they use
dogs to pull the sled and that's how
they get around because cars are not
very useful in the arctic or very cold
areas sleds are better
the next one a small round house made of
snow you've probably seen these before
right
and when it's very cold people will make
these out of ice they'll make them out
of snow
it's a little house very interesting
house right chemisoil right how would
you like to live there maybe a little
bit cold but it's actually warm inside
it's warmer inside than outside what is
it called it's called an igloo
igloo right and igloo is a house made of
snow or ice in the arctic or antarctic
to sense sounds now of course we have
many organs in our head that we use to
know what's going on around us right
when we use our eyes we're seeing when
we use our mouth our tongue we're
tasting but when we use our ears what
are we doing then we are
hearing to hear is to sense sounds right
now you are listening to me you are
hearing the noises the sounds that i'm
making it here is an irregular verb hear
heard heard
so uh
maybe you
uh heard me yesterday too as also today
maybe you're studying very hard right so
here heard heard we use herd to describe
sensing sounds in the past
okay let's go
for the reading of the vocabulary
exercises sorry the vocabulary exercises
we have several words here we need to
fill in the blanks very easy exercise
right so we have our sentences we need
to use these words to complete each
sentence let's go over the words the
first one is
frost
frost
then
popular
popular
then
unusual
unusual
next one is shine
shine
next one frigid
frigid
frigid right
opposite
opposite
next one remote
remote
and the next one predict
predict
okay so let's use these words figure out
how we can put them into the sentences
number one
i got cold i got cold i became cold
because of the peep weather what kind of
weather makes you cold
what kind of weather makes you cold
probably this word is what we're looking
for frigid
very cold remember frigid is very cold
so if the weather is very cold
you become cold you will get cold i got
cold because of the frigid weather
number two
oh by the way it's interesting
this says i got cold that just means you
are not warm anymore but if you add one
little word
and you put a
i got a cold it's completely different
that means you got sick up i o
right i got a cold i became sick because
of the frigid weather but if you don't
use a and you just say i got cold it
just means your body was cold you didn't
get sick you go inside you get warm no
problem
so it's sometimes in english it's very
important whether you use a or no a
changes the meaning okay just a little
note
number two
after the heavy rain so after it rained
very heavily after the heavy rain the
sun began to
what
so after it rains the clouds go away you
can see the sun the sun begins to what
give off light it begins to
shine okay so the sun began to shine
after the heavy rain
number three
the arctic is a very big
place not many people go to the arctic
it's very difficult to live there like i
said before you can't really build a
road in the arctic so it's hard to get
to the arctic a place that is hard to
get to is remote the arctic is a very
remote place it's hard to get to
number four in winter his car window was
covered with what i talked about this
when we talked about this word when it's
really cold outside
there will be a covering of ice on
plants on grass
on your windows what do we call that ice
we call that ice frost so in winter his
car window
was covered with frost
okay number five
the beep of hot is cold
interesting hot and cold pandero right
they are what they are opposites so the
opposite of hot is cold right the
opposite of happy is sad right the
opposite of tall is short okay so the
opposite of a is
b right that's a good thing of course a
and b are opposites pandero okay
number six i can't beep the result of
the match
the result of the match match here means
like game or contest for example a
soccer match right
do you know who will win
sometimes it's hard to tell it's very
difficult to know the future so i can't
when you know the future you probably
don't know the future of course it's
very difficult to know the future it's
very difficult to know who will win the
match
which team will win so it's difficult to
predict i can't predict the result of
the match i don't know i can't tell the
future okay i'm not a champion
okay next one number seven he is a very
beep singer in korea
so we're looking for something that has
to do with singer or entertainers or
actors of course if a singer
is to be
successful many people have to like that
person
so
if we're talking about somebody who is
many people like them he is a very what
he's a very popular singer in korea and
number eight
she is a girl with what ability she is a
girl with some type of ability the only
word left of course but also we're
looking for something that's
uh makes her unique makes her different
from other people
she's a girl with unusual ability of
course people with unusual ability you
know could be a good thing
somebody who sings very well that's not
common that's unusual somebody who has a
very good voice so somebody who has an
unusual talent they can become famous as
an entertainer or even or in many other
fields right if you have an unusual
ability to do math in your head you can
become a scientist or a teacher or a
mathematician right so if you have an
unusual ability sometimes that's very
good it's not common you should develop
that ability okay anyway that wraps it
up with the vocabulary let's take a
short break now and we'll take a look at
the reading section in a few minutes
[Music]
hello kids how are you doing today
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
i'm brian stewart we're on lesson six
fossil fuels so in this lesson we will
focus on
let's learn about how plants from
long ago
can cause pollution today and of course
pollution is not good for our bodies so
our topic our subject is health right so
that's what we'll be talking about in
this lesson
let's take a look here first of all what
are fossil fuels there are many kinds of
fossil fuels in this video here we can
see these machines working in a field or
in a plane what are these machines doing
they're getting oil from the ground
they're pumping up oil from deep
underground and oil
oil
is a fossil fuel we make gas
out of
oil right kyung kyung-yu i think you say
in korean kyung-yu right
where you go to the juju so the gas
station and you get fuel
right so oil is made into gas it's a
type of fossil fuel also we'll look at
other types of fossil fuels in this
lesson
okay our first word for the vocabulary
he's very happy he's very proud i hope
you get the same thing he got an a plus
yay
right it can be done yes you can get an
a plus it is
possible yes you can do it right it's
possible you can do it you can do it it
is possible okay number two
wow very exciting picture of course he
is a firefighter
fire fighter
and the word though is not firefighter
it is to need now when we say to need
what's another word for that it's
require a firefighter needs water to put
out the fire he requires
water to put out the fire to require now
maybe a little difficult pronunciation
require
require so to require is to need
something you say pill yohada right
yohada i need it
i need it i require it it i must have it
okay number three
this is a big city looks like new york
central park is in the background but
when we talk about all big cities any
big city connected with a city connected
with a city we say urban
urban so if you live in a city you are
living in an urban
setting you are living in an urban
setting but
if you live on a farm in the countryside
you are living in a rural
setting so urban and
rural
rural pandero right they are opposites
so i live in a city i live in an urban
place or setting i live in a farm i live
in a rural place or setting okay so
rural is countryside urban is city okay
number four having to do with factories
so when we say when we talk about
factories and factories that are making
things and machines the process of
manufacturing we're usually talking
about
industrial
topics or industrial things industrial
is an adjective having to do with
factories uh
this job is an industrial job right uh
this uh business deal is an industrial
business deal having to do with
factories
in industrial
industrial industrial okay so the
pronunciation it's a long word
industry oh
industrial okay
okay next one number five well this is
very interesting what is this if we look
closely
this is rock right it's par it's a piece
of rock but there's some strange oh it
looks kind of scary it's a spider right
it's a spider that died a long long time
ago and a long time ago this rock was
mud it was soft and the spider's body
laid there and got covered with mud and
got pressed and because of the pressure
it turned into rock so that all that is
left of the spider is this form or this
shape in the rock it's all that remains
all that remains the remains of the
spider
is all that is left of this spider is
the shape of the spider in the rock
so if something is gone something it
goes away or something dies
sometimes there are
there's a little bit that remains from
that thing that died a long time ago
remains remains
okay next one number six
uh to come together when things come
together what do they do they form
something okay so they form a field they
might form a landscape when you put like
wood and concrete and other materials
together
you can form a house or a building it's
when you make you
have many things or materials come
together they form or make or create
some other thing they form something
okay
seven are you hungry looks like
somebody's cooking something right a
series of actions or changes when you
cook something you're doing a series of
actions step one step two step three you
follow many actions or changes different
steps
we call all of those steps together
that's called a process
what is the process of making chocolate
chip cookies what is the process of
making a pancake you follow the
different steps those steps are a
process
how to do something okay next one number
eight
maybe your mom or dad does this a lot
maybe you do it right if the light goes
out in your room you know you flip the
switch
it doesn't work it's time to change
something for something else so you take
the old light bulb
it's a light bulb by the way
you take the old light bulb and you put
a new light bulb in its place what are
you doing you are replacing
replace the old one uh with a new one
you replace the old one get rid of the
old one put a new one you replace it
replace the old one with a new one
replace the old light bulb with a new
light bulb okay
number nine
to let go right very interesting picture
i think it's been photoshopped okay but
anyway this person is letting these
doves these birds go right to let go
means
to release let go right if you love
something release it if it comes back to
you it loves you too but if it doesn't
come back
it never was to be oh well so anyway to
release something to release let it go
let it go release it release
release
let it go
number 10
to save now this looks strange what are
they saving well they're saying what
what are they doing they're digging in
the ground they're going to
plant trees or bushes so they are trying
to save the earth
so what are they doing they are
conserving especially when we talk about
protecting the environment or trying to
save the earth we are talking about
conserving the earth now you can also
conserve other things if you are careful
with the electricity you use in your
house turn off the light when you leave
the room you want to conserve
electricity
if you want to conserve water when you
wash your hands don't run the water the
whole time run the water get your hands
wet turn it off
use soap then turn it on again and wash
the soap off conserve water save water
save electricity save the earth
conservation project okay
conserve
conserve is the way we pronounce that
eleven
what's that doesn't look very pretty but
it's very important
a black stone burned for heat what do we
call it we call it
coal c is a hard k
sound coal
coal
coal is a black stone like we see in
this picture and we burn it for heat
if you go to uh
what do you say bulgogi or gogi jeep
bulgogi jeep you want to get bulgogi or
uh some places where they have the the
the outside barbecue right they put coal
in the fire
underneath and they burn it right and
that's an example of coal you can see it
every day right so blackstone burned for
heat is coal coal is very important for
our modern life
next one
you don't worry about this you're not
driving
but when you get older you have to be
careful look at the gas right because
when you become when you when you
use up all the gas you use up all the
gas no more
right
then you have run out of gas run out run
out and the way to use it
run
out
of
momo
run out of gas run out of food run out
of water
that means you used it all up you used
it now it's all gone
we can use up all the water we can use
up all the food in your refrigerator we
can use up all the electricity right
that means we don't have any more it's
opseo
we run out
okay number 13 to make dirty imagine
that this is not water maybe this is
some chemical that's coming out of these
pipes into the stream it's making the
stream or the river
dirty what is it doing it's polluting so
when
uh
we make the environment dirty we are
polluting the environment and sometimes
factories or industrial places
industrial companies will pollute the
environment because of what they're
doing their activities make dirty water
it makes dirty air or it makes things
that we throw away in the ground so
dirty land if we make something dirty we
are polluting the environment
pollute
pollute okay
next one
fuel that was very fast fuel is very
energetic isn't it so it jumps on the
screen okay
something that produces heat or power is
fuel and it's interesting to look at
this picture because you say well
where's the fuel it's not an engine he's
using his legs the fuel is inside his
body he ate breakfast that morning the
breakfast is the fuel the food that we
eat helps us produce heat or in this
case power right when we put gas in our
car that's the fuel that makes the
engine go it gives it power to the
engine so fuel there's many kinds of
fuel right and this word of course is
fuel okay next one
a very peaceful picture very nice
picture looks like the american west
looks like where i'm from okay
a part of a place if we look at this
very wide landscape very big what very
big area an area is a part of a place
right so the area in your house right
that's an area your bedroom is an area
your kitchen is an area it's part of a
place
okay wow this is very exciting picture
right this looks like it's downtown in a
very large town downtown in a very large
town but what's a very large town a very
large town
we have a special word for that right if
there's just a few people living
together just a few houses we say that's
a village
okay it's a village if a few more houses
a few more buildings we can say it's a
town
but more and more like this
huge buildings very tall buildings
millions of people living together we
say that
is a city so village town city okay
okay let's go over the vocabulary
here we have an interesting and exciting
a fun vocabulary exercise it's a puzzle
and this is a crossword puzzle that you
have in your book
we could say it's a crossword americans
say cross
word
puzzle crossword puzzle
so our uh
object is to solve the puzzle we say
it's crossword because you have words
that go down and you have words that go
across right and you have to fill in
the boxes with the letters crossword one
down and across first we start with a
cross the clues for a cross now these
are the words that we're going to put in
the crossword puzzle there are eight
words let's go over them first
possible
possible
require
require
urban
urban
industrial
industrial
remains
remains
form
form
process
process
and
replace
replace those are the words we need to
fit into the cross word puzzle now when
you do a crossword puzzle usually they
give you the clues for the words that
are going across and then in the next
section they give you clues for words
that go down in the puzzle right down
first we're going to talk about the
words they're going across for these
clues we have pictures okay so for
number one we have a picture that is our
clue this is a picture of a city now
when we talk about the city setting
right what do we say i taught you two
words right first i taught you in the
city you say it's urban and in the
countryside you say it's a rural but
this is a city so this is the word we
need
urban and we can see
u r b a n one two three four five one
two three four five that's an important
point about crossword puzzles you have
to fit the same number of letters the
same number of letters
in the blank so you're looking for a
five letter word that goes with this
picture
let's see that in number three going
across number three we have one two
three four a four letter word that
matches this picture remember we talked
about this picture when things come
together they do something right what do
they do they form something so they form
a field or they form a landscape
to form
okay next one
number seven oh my gosh one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten
a ten letter word we're looking for a 10
letter
word
that goes with this picture so which is
a 10 letter word that goes with this
picture in this picture we can see this
is the inside of a factory so having to
do with factories remember the word we
said that was industrial one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten
that's our ten letter word that matches
the picture
okay
number eight
aha we're following a certain series of
steps to cook something or you know to
make something it doesn't have to be
cooking it can be anything we need one
two three four five six seven
seven words where is a seven letter word
that me has to do with this picture
one two three four five six seven aha
that's our word it is
process
process of course you can't just do
the number of words you have to make
sure it matches the picture right a
process is a series of steps that you do
a series of actions or changes to do
something
okay
that was the words that were across they
all had pictures now we're looking at
the words that go down in the in the
puzzle the words that go down the clues
are part of a sentence it's like filling
in the blank except in this case the
blank is the box right the box is for
each letter of the word what word makes
sense in this sentence babies beep care
and attention
babies need something right babies need
care and attention what's another word
for need that we talked about would it
be
require one two three four five six
seven one two three four five six seven
aha that fits and it makes sense
babies require care and attention that's
true so that's the correct answer
number four
i gave the beep
of my lunch to the dog i gave the what
of my lunch to the dog well think about
that do you have a dog when you eat food
your dog looks at you like this
right
so after you finish eating maybe you
don't eat everything so you give what's
left
to your dog right what is left is the
what it's the remains you give the
remains of your lunch maybe a piece of
bread or maybe some rice or maybe a
piece of apple dogs eat apples right so
you give the remains of your lunch to
your dog but don't do that actually
because your dog will beg you every time
you eat right so it's not good to give
the remains of your lunch or dinner to
your dog give them their food separately
okay next one number five down
new cars will beep the older cars
remember we talked about this you
change one thing for another if
something's old it doesn't work you
remove it and you put a new one in its
place what are you doing you are
replacing new cars will replace
the older cars so you will replace you
will replace the old one with a new one
replace new cars
to
new cars will replace the older cars
they will replace the older cars okay
number six
it is
beep but not easy
so when we talk about this is a little
bit more difficult right
you can do many things some things you
can do are very easy but some things you
can do are very hard don't give up even
though it's very hard you can do it it's
what it's
possible
it's possible but not easy
just because something is hard or not
easy doesn't mean it's not possible
right many things in your life will be
hard to do but you can do it it's
possible it is possible to do
okay that wraps it up for the vocabulary
crossword puzzle it's kind of fun uh
putting a crossword puzzle together
isn't it but in every crossword puzzle
you have to find the clues across and
then down and you can mix them up and of
course remember pay attention to the
number of letters in each box okay well
let's take a short break here we'll come
back soon and we'll go over the reading
passage together
[Music]
[Music]
hey everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary i'm brian stewart
we're on lesson seven right now
do you hear that what do you hear what
no i'm just kidding that's the name of
the lesson right do you hear that do you
hear that we're going to focus on let's
learn
what sound is
so we're going to study about sound what
exactly is sound when we talk about
things like sound or sight or smells
that's an area of science so we're
talking about science in this lesson
first of all what is sound you know when
we talk about sound
sound is something that we hear through
our ears whether it's somebody who's
yelling somebody who speaks in a loud
voice
loud voice
so they could be
yelling
yell to yell
he's yelling or he's shout
shout ing right shouting so sometimes we
hear loud sounds when people are
speaking in a loud voice they're
shouting or they're yelling
i'm not shouting or yelling i won't do
that to you but i'm not whispering
either right pandiro yelling or shouting
is
whisper
whisper
whisper very small sound whispering
okay now down here
this is a problem with electronic
devices your computers your music
players somebody's playing loud music
it's too loud please
please
turn
it
down
turn it down
means turn down the volume it's too loud
he will say to his friend hey
please turn it down it's too loud
okay let's talk about some vocabulary
having to do with sound
the first word is to hit hard when
something hits something very hard like
lightning comes from the sky and hits
the ground
hard what do we say we say it's strike
and this is a good picture because
usually we call
this type of action lightning strike if
the lightning touches the ground we say
where did it strike
where did it strike ground but there's
other things we can talk about when we
strike something if we're playing a drum
we strike the drum with a a drum stick
and we make a sound so it's a strike to
hit something hard strike
okay number two
very strange people it's it's kind of
hard to have pictures when you're
describing a sound right so some of
these pictures we have to think a little
bit okay this is a picture of a sound
telling of a danger these people are not
crazy
they're supposed to be they're supposed
to be very frightened or scared why
because they heard a sound that tells
them of danger what kind of sound tells
you of a danger if there's a fire in
your apartment building
what can you hear some sound will go off
telling you be careful there's a fire we
call that sound an alarm
a fire alarm if a robber or a bad person
breaks a window to get into a store at
night to steal something then a burglar
alarm will go off a burglar
burglar
a burglar is the bad person the criminal
who breaks into the store a burglar
alarm a fire alarm that's a sound that
tells you hey
danger there's something bad happening
three
now a message a message telling that
something bad may happen not an alarm
it's before an alarm right
you see a sign
that says
be careful joshum
something bad might happen the word we
want actually is on the sign itself it's
a warning warning
warning joshim heyo right mori joshum
hail watch for your head right watch
your head or in this case
don't go
on the land don't go past this sign it's
dangerous
warning
warning it's something it's a message
that tells us something bad may happen
we should pay attention to warnings
look at warnings they will help keep you
safe
okay next one number three number four
how high or low a sound is
now when we talk about sound and we'll
look at this more in the reading
you can say a sound is high or low
in terms of what in terms of
pitch
now when you say high sound or low sound
think of it this way an alarm clock you
know might sound like this
that's a high sound
alarm sounds don't sound like this
that's a low sound okay so you have a
high sound and you have a low sound when
we talk about that we're talking about
the pitch
pitch
what is the pitch of the sound usually
we say it's a high pitched high
pitched
high pitched or low
pitched
sound
right another couple of examples a small
dog right a small dog goes
that's a high pitched sound but a big
dog goes
right that's a low pitched sound so
high-pitched sound low pitched sound
we're talking about pitch
number five
what's wrong she's so she's so crazy
she's really angry right
how loud or soft a sound is maybe she's
crying she's screaming now we're talking
about
loudness or softness remember before i
told you if something's too loud you say
turn it down you want to turn down the
volume okay
so we have a loud sound the volume is
high
a soft sound the volume is low i can't
hear it right
please turn up the volume so high volume
low volume and as you can see we also
use high pitch low pitch so we use the
words high and low to talk about pitch
or to talk about volume high pitch high
volume
low pitch low volume but they're
different things right pitch and volume
are two different things about sound
okay number six
again it's hard to draw a picture or to
show a picture of a sound in this case
to make a long deep sound
here you have to imagine you know if you
see a lightning storm right you see
lightning but after the lightning what
do you hear after the lightning you hear
thunder right
and thunder
is a long deep sound it is a rumble
the rumble
right especially if you hear
see the lightning it's very close to you
now you hear
and it goes
it's not the big thunder that that
happens right away that's not long
that's very short it's bang whoa but
then you can hear the rumble for a
little bit afterwards it's very deep and
surrounding sound
in the sky that's a rumble also if
you're hungry
your stomach will rumble
right oh i'm hungry
right it's time to eat so your stomach
might rumble okay
okay next one
to shake quickly these guys are a street
construction crew before they uh change
the street they have to break the street
up so they use a jackhammer this is a
jack
hammer and the way the jackhammer works
is it moves up and down very quickly to
shake what is it doing is it like this
it's
vibrating to vibrate
vibrate okay to shake quickly back and
forth is to vibrate
okay number eight
to pull
and then let go to pull and let go you
can all say what are they doing with the
guitar they are plucking the guitar not
right now right now they're tuning the
guitar but after they do that then he or
she i'm not sure
okay because long hair i don't know
he or she is going to
uh touch this the strings but pluck the
strings very quickly going to pull the
string and then let go and that's how
many string instruments are played you
pluck the strings
right you pull them quickly and then let
go you pluck
you also maybe pluck your hair don't do
that but some people might do that they
pluck to pull and then let go pull the
hair let go
pluck
now this person is a referee a referee
at a game maybe you're playing soccer or
you're playing uh baseball or something
and the referee has a whistle a whistle
and when he blows that whistle
right there is a loud high pitched sound
coming from the lips or whistles what is
that it's a whistle the same one that i
just wrote up there so we call this this
um instrument you can't see it it's made
of metal but what he has in his mouth
it's a whistle
also it's a verb so this whistle that i
put up here this would be a noun
and a high sound coming from lips or
whistles well of course the sound is a
is a noun but you can also say
to whistle and that is a verb
so whistle can be a noun whistle can
also be a verb if you use to whistle for
example can you whistle
can you whistle i am whistling but the
sound i'm making that is a whistle so
whistle can be noun or verb
10.
a loud warning sound we talked about
this a little bit before a loud warning
sound we talked about alarm but alarm
can also be
siren especially on a fire truck or a
police car we say the siren can you hear
the sirens the police are coming or the
fire truck is coming that's a siren we
can also call those alarm when a fire
truck goes to a fire if there are two
fire trucks we say it's a
two
alarm
fire
that means
two fire trucks came two alarm fire two
fire trucks came to put out the fire if
it's a five alarm fire what's a big fire
five fire trucks came okay so alarm and
siren very similar but usually we say
siren is on a vehicle it's the noise or
the the object that makes the noise
number 11
something that is asked right he has a
question this boy has a question raise
your arm if you have a question question
is something that is asked okay next one
opposite of forward
so this girl
she's kind of looking this way but she
could be looking behind her forward
pandero is very simple
back or you could also put back word
right
forward back or backward sometimes
people don't say ward they just say back
of course you can also say front front
back
frontward or forward
backward don't say frontward
forward or backwards usually forward
though is used for motion
he is walking forward
look forward backward walk backward
look
backward but if you're talking about for
example uh somebody's uh where somebody
thing is this is my front this is my
back so you could say both things right
look forward look to the front or this
is your front look back look backward or
this is my back okay so forward and back
13.
very interesting picture they're very
dressed up
softly softly means what it means gently
he is gently uh he's a gentleman so he's
acting very gently right
gently is softly not hard
for example if you're playing an
instrument like the drum before i said
to strike you hit something hard
you can play a drum
gently or softly making a little bit of
noise
playing it gently okay
okay oh here we have a dinosaur right
the part of the body between the head
and the shoulders here's the head here's
the shoulder so what is this part of the
body between the head and the shoulders
and of course on the dinosaur it's very
long also on a giraffe it's very long we
say it's the neck right the neck is the
part of the body between the head and
the shoulders on me on people the neck
is very short on dinosaurs some
dinosaurs and giraffes the neck is very
long
okay a long thin rope what is this rope
that this person is tying around their
finger we call that a string a string
you prob you might have strings in your
shoes
to close your shoes up you probably have
strings in your backpack right maybe you
have strings in your backpack to close
pockets strings are very useful
okay our last word
forward forward means
fourth okay now we use fourth by the way
that might be hard to pronounce
fourth
and then r right and th
fourth
fourth
okay
so what he's doing is his voice is
coming forth right uh his air is coming
forth his sound is coming forth from his
mouth so it's coming forward right it's
going forward from his mouth but when
you speak the sound is coming forth
from your mouth okay so that's
interesting that's a where you would
probably use that word
okay let's take a look at the exercises
the first exercise here complete each
sentence with a word from the box
we have many different sentences we have
blanks in those sentences we have to
fill those blanks with words from the
box what are the words the words are
strike

fire what what is that sound it's the

okay number two i was so hungry that so
adjective that good construction i was
so hungry that i could hear my stomach

word i gave two examples one was the
thunder you know the thunder in the sky
after a lightning strike
but you can also hear very m more
commonly when you get hungry your
stomach will make a gold gold gold sound
it will do what it will
rumble i was so hungry that i could hear
my stomach rumble
okay number three
birds sing at a really high
what
when you hear birds they're like

that a high sound it's like a little dog
barking
that's also a high what it's a high
pitch
birds sing at a high pitch
i've never heard a bird sing in a low
pitch right that would be very strange
i'd be scared what kind of bird is that
okay
usually birds will sing in a very high
pitch a very high pitched noise
let's move on to number four
the police gave me a beep not to go near
the building so the police are telling
me don't go not to go don't go near the
building why because it's dangerous and
it's a message that the police giving me
the police are giving me a message
telling me not to go somewhere they are
doing what they are giving me a warning

somewhere
five i can't hear the radio
turn the
beep up this is an example i gave you
remember at the very beginning we saw
the boy right he was is too loud so he
says turn it down please turn it down

want it to turn up you're turning up
what what are you turning up so that you
can hear something you're turning up the
volume turn the volume up or pandito
turn the volume down but if you can't

guitar a violin a harp right what are
they doing they're grabbing the strings
and they're letting go they pull and let
go they are plucking watch the violinist
pluck the string gently
usually violinists don't pluck the
string right they have a bow and they
they rub the strings but sometimes they
might pluck the strings to make a sound
also some violinists do that
okay seven and eight
lightning may beep the tree during a
thunderstorm so this is like lightning
might come down and hit the tree hard of
course lightning hits hard with a lot of
energy right so it might
come down and remember this is a very
common word used with lightning what
word was it we said strike lightning may
strike the tree during a thunderstorm
number eight i felt my cell phone beep
in my pocket so if you have a cell phone

okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
section of the lesson let's take a short
break here we'll come back and do the
reading
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading

we're going to focus on we're going to
learn about the meaning of
too cool so i'll explain what that means
later and we're going to learn about
music trends in the 1990s
so what are some music trends in the
1990s
before we do that you know we could talk
about 1990s music trends in korea what
was a trend in korea very popular one do

it's interesting every generation has a
different uh style or trend right your
trend i'm sorry will be gone in about 10
years but there will be a new trend that
will come up so trends constantly change
okay so before we talk about the reading
passage though let's talk about some
words let's learn some vocabulary number
one
foolish now this man looks very foolish
right it's very foolish for a grown man
to be riding a tricycle this is a
tricycle
not a bicycle but a tricycle a tricycle
is for kids not old men he looks very
foolish we could also say ridiculous

something else you imitate like an
animal or you imitate another person
right so kids will do this a lot even
adults will do that we see something you

we're like a monkey or some other animal
we're imitating that or sometimes people
look at other people and say wow that
person's really cool that person is
really interesting i want to be like

other person so you can imitate animals
you can imitate people
okay next one
what's going on here
she's wearing jeans that fit her body
they're tight but these jeans are huge
they're very big so not tight there's a
special word for that we can say baggy
but baggy really refers to like a style
of fashion if this woman puts on these
jeans i would not say they're baggy i'd
say they're too big
they'll fall down right
baggy jeans would be okay on her waist
but they would be very wide on the legs
right and a baggy shirt is a shirt
that's too big and it's very loose on
her so baggy clothes it's a fashion
style we'll talk about that later but
baggy not tight very loose fitting
clothes very loose
fitting
loose fitting clothes are baggy clothes
so are your clothes tight or your
clothes loose are they baggy okay
next one
this is a good picture to show it's a
stage in a process of change this of
course is the moon and if we look at the
moon we know that the moon changes shape
in the sky there's different
uh stages we can say phase
what phase is the moon in we have the
full moon
right
full moon
whoops
full moon we have half moon
and although it's kind of weird to look
at it right this would be no moon
because we don't see that
right that's when the earth's light is
reflected in the moon it's kind of like
this one here right okay we don't see
the moon in the sky okay so full moon
half moon no moon those are the phases
of the moon and they change every month
don't they so depending on the month you
can see full moon half moon or no moon
uh
and that is the phase of the moon but
we're talking about the moon here but if
you think about it
many things go through a phase you go
through phases human beings go through
phases we have different stages
baby
child teenager young adult middle aged
adult and old person these are all
stages we all go through phases not just
people but all living things right

happening unexpectedly this poor woman

okay feeling
now this guy looks like he's
sad or bored but
that's not the feeling we're looking for
we're looking for another word that
means feeling and that of course is mood
right it when we talk about mood we're
talking about feeling for example are
you in a good mood if you're in a good
mood
you feel happy
uh you're happy you're energetic you're
in a good mood
or
oh be careful the teacher is in a bad
mood a bad mood

stressed out so you can be in a good
mood or you can be in a bad mood it
talks about what are you feeling these
days what
how do you feel okay so i'm in a good
mood i'm in a bad mood depending on your
feeling
okay well what's going on here uh
informal words used by
particular people now this is kind of
funny because the word we're looking for
is slang but it doesn't just mean that
people who look like this guy use slang
everybody uses slang right and some
stage of their life right in some part
of their life everybody uses slang slang
is just really informal words
informal words like if i say um
hey hey brah hey dude right instead of
saying hello uh to a person a man i
don't call him a man i call him a dude
dude is more it's like slang hey dude
what's up how's it hanging right what's
hanging you know what's going on um that
would be slang okay maybe i'm getting
old i'm forgetting all my slang but
anyway slang is informal words words
that are not formal and we use slang
with your friends it's not proper to use
slang when you're at work or when you're
talking to your teacher or when you're
talking to your parents usually slang is
used among friends
okay next one
this is kind of funny is a cute little
kid right his his clothes are way too
big for him his shoes are really big not
tight
loose remember when we talked about
baggy
very similar right
baggy whoops
whoa whoa stop okay baggy baggy and
loose are very similar together right it

baggy okay
12
to have something on your body so she
looks actually like a model she's what
is she doing though this is a
an interesting looking dress isn't it
what is she doing she's wearing
this dress now be careful with wear okay
wear means that you have
something on your body it doesn't mean
that you put it on
right that's different if you say what
will you wear today that means what are
you wearing what are you wearing that
means what are you wearing now what is
on your body but in the morning you put
on clothes
put on clothes so you can say i will put
on a shirt right i will put on shoes and
then during the day you wear those
clothes okay so where where is an
irregular verb it changes
form for the past so we say where
war
worn wear war worn
okay next one
wow what are these guys doing here the
part of the body that bends in the
center of the leg so these people are
not standing right they're kind of on
their what on this part of the the leg
that bends in the middle we call that
the knee
knee so i'm talking about what are these
guys doing here
they're not standing
on their feet they
are
kneeling to kneel that's interesting
this is a verb to kneel it's when you
stand on your knees right you get off
your feet and you're like this that is
to kneel and you can see it comes from
knee right because they're on their
knees so knee is the part of your leg
this part here and if you sit down and
are
just on your knees then you are kneeling
to kneel and you can see it comes from
that word knee interesting okay
of course you have one of this
in your book bag or in your room at home
i hope so
this is a book that tells you what words
mean of course you should have one in
your in in the korean language but maybe
you have a korean english one too that
says what words in korean what do they
mean or what word is it in english right
what is it it's of course a dictionary
dictionary
dictionary so it's actually four
four sounds dictionary
dictionary dictionary and that of course
is a book that tells you what words mean
if you want to know what a word means
you look it up
look
it
up
in
a
dictionary look it up in a dictionary
what does this word mean i don't know
look it up in a dictionary okay
whoa
cool guy right okay music in which words
are spoken fast
it's a type of music where people
say the words very fast and actually
it's kind of like poetry
but they're singing the words and they
sing them very quickly what is it you
know it's rap
rap is a musical style it's actually a
singing style where people sing the
words very quickly okay it's like
somebody you know it's not just like
reading a poem it's like reading a poem
to music into a beat and very quickly
and many of the words rhyme in other
words they sound similar
okay
last we have to imitate
this guy looks like johnny depp from
pirates of the caribbean right so he's
imitating johnny depp and we talked
about this to copy so remember we talked
about imitate before to act like
somebody else or to act like something
else we said that's to imitate but we
can also say it means also to copy so
you can copy the behavior of an animal
or you can copy the behavior or the
dress or the style of another person and
that is to copy
okay
let's talk about our all the vocabulary
exercises here we have synonyms remember
what a synonym means it means a word
that has a similar meaning to another
word a synonym
match the words in the box with their
synonyms listed below synonyms
same or similar meaning
okay so our words are
in the box
phase
imitate
suddenly
regret those are words
four words now we have to match these
words
to their synonyms and down here we have
copy
repent
abruptly
and stage
okay
so number one
copy well that's easy right because we
learned both of those words as part of
the vocabulary first we learned
one word and then we learned copy
remember i just talked about when you
copy something you're behaving very
similar to somebody else you are what
you are imitating them so copy and
imitate have similar meanings they're
very close to meaning they're the same
thing okay to copy to is to imitate now
number two is a little hinduro
because
repent we didn't learn that word repent
so look it up in your dictionary
if you do you will find out that it
means something here i will i will
define what repent means repent
is something let's say you do something
and you feel sorry about what you did so
you repent you say oh i wish i didn't do
that i'm really sorry i'm sorry i did
that so if you are sorry about something
you did if you are sorry about your
actions what word means that ah here
regret you regret what you did repent is
regret
okay next one three abruptly again
abruptly means something happens and
it's not expected something happens
quickly you don't expect it so what word
did we learn that means something
happens unexpectedly it of course means
suddenly suddenly abruptly and suddenly
are the same meaning
here we have stage
okay now we learned the word stage and
part of the definition for stage
was
this other word they use this other word
and the other word of course was phase
and i talked about phases of the moon
actually this was the word we learned
right and stage was in the definition so
we talked about the moon there are
different stages or phases of the moon
and they're also when we talk about
people or any living thing all living
things go through different stages
okay
that's synonyms what about
antonyms
antonym means the opposite so synonym
means the same antonym is opposite
pandero right so match the words in the
box with their antonyms opposite
meanings
listed below
the words that we studied are ridiculous
ridiculous
mellow
upbeat
and baggy okay i didn't repeat all those
but ridiculous mellow upbeat
and baggy these are the words that are
the antonyms of the words in the box
number one we have violent
violent
is something that is uh of course very
aggressive very angry
and really you know or bad so somebody
who is violent is the opposite of what
opposite pandero what is the opposite of
violent here the opposite of violent
would be
mello remember mello means calm and
gentle
gentle is the opposite of violent so you
can have a violent person or you can
have a gentle person they are opposites
two
sad
what is the opposite of sad what word
did we look at that we learn that is the
opposite of sad which word up here means
happy and energetic
that word of course is upbeat and of
course that would be the opposite of sad
somebody who's sad is not happy they're
not energetic right they're just sad
okay three
sensible now we didn't learn that word
okay but we're looking for the opposite
of sensible what does sensible mean if
we look it up in the dictionary you will
see that sensible means acting in a
a normal ordinary way or using common
sense right in other words acting in the
proper way if you see a man in a
business suit who is being very polite
to other people he's being sensible but
if you see a man in the business suit
riding a little tricycle right that's
not sensible that's very silly that's
what it's ridiculous it's ridiculous so
sensible and ridiculous are opposites
antonyms
number four is tight
that's very easy we we looked at that as
part of the definition for one of the
words we saw the woman wearing
tight jeans and she was holding some
very big genes that would be what they
would be
baggy on her so tight and baggy are
opposites or antonyms okay so that's a
review of these words here now that you
have a good idea of what these words
mean we'll see them in the reading
passage let's go over that in just a few
moments
okay
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary i'm brian stewart
in this lesson lesson 9 you'll notice an
interesting title bravo

a performance a band or somebody does a
really good job and we clap our hands

lesson so what is this lesson about
bravo encore what are we talking about

hymduro word right that's a difficult
word what is the philharmonic the
philharmonic the new york philharmonic
is a large group of musicians people who
play instruments all different kinds of
instruments okay
so we'll learn about them we'll think
about different sounds and what sounds
are good and what sounds are bad okay so
of course for good sounds we say bravo
encore for bad sounds we say boo
no no good right okay so let's get
started with the uh with the lesson but
before we do that
to give you an idea of what the
philharmonic is we can take a look at
this video here
this video shows an orchestra that's one
of the words we'll learn in the
vocabulary orchestra and orchestra as
you can see are many many musicians
playing together there's different
sections here we have violins right over
here we have the chalu right over in the
back you have people playing trumpets or
different kinds of horns you also have
the drummers they're all in different
places in the orchestra and of course
you have the audience outside and at the
end if the orchestra is good they will
say bravo bravo encore right they will
show their appreciation they will say
wow that was a good
uh musical performance okay so that's
what we're talking about here this type
of orchestra let's begin with the words
are you ready let's go
okay number one word number one
the person who leads a musical group in
the video maybe it's a little hard to
see but there was one man standing in
front of all of the musicians and
usually he has a stick right and he
waves it like this okay what do we call
that person he's the leader of the
musical group we call him the conductor
conductor
conductor
he is
the leader of an orchestra he leads the
musicians right so he tells them when to
play or you know how fast to play and
he's always doing this he doesn't make
any music right he's just telling the
other musicians
how to play okay and he's like the
leader he makes sure they sound good
okay so that's the conductor
next we have a public performance of
music
so before we saw the video there were
many musicians right so many but look at
this picture there's only one two three
and maybe a number four there's a guy
behind there this would just be a band
not an orchestra but a band an orchestra
sometimes there's just one person a
singer right but it's any any public
performance of music
any time
that somebody plays music for the public
and there's an audience what do we call
that event
there's a special word for that event we
call it a concert
concert a concert is any performance of
music that you go to it can be one
singer it can be force
musicians or it can be many musicians it
doesn't matter
when you go to listen to music it's
called a concert
okay next one
of course i've mentioned this already
several times right especially in the
video i showed there's different
sections now
these
instruments well that's the word right
there it's hard to say it's an
instrument right it's a device for
playing music there are many types of
instruments
okay instrument or instruments
plural right because here we see a
violin and of course here we probably
this is part of a tuba and maybe this is
a trombone over here there's many kinds
of instruments
many kinds of instruments i said like
violin
violin is a type a tuba right the tuba
is the big horn right that's that goes
all around a person it's a big bell out
here
right okay that's the tuba now you have
a violin a guitar is an instrument a
flute is an instrument there are many
types of instruments devices for playing
music
instrument okay next one
a large group of musicians who play
together don't say philharmonic
philharmonic is the name of one of these
we're looking for orchestra
orchestra three syllables or ca stra
orchestra and orchestra the philharmonic
the new york philharmonic is a type
of orchestra it's the name
of that orchestra right but it's a large
group you can see many people it's a
very large group and in that group you
have
smaller groups each playing different
instruments you may have a group of
people who play the violin a group of
people who just sing a group of people
well just one person playing the piano a
group of people playing the flute so an
orchestra is a large group of musicians
in the orchestra sometimes there are
smaller groups of musicians playing the
same instrument and they can make a
really big and powerful sound and that's
special about an orchestra okay next one
u.s president barack obama but that's
not the word right
important in history someone who's
important in history is well something
that is important is historic the reason
they're using this picture is because he
is the first black president it's not
because it's barack obama it's because
of the historic event first time that a
black person has been the president of
the united states that is historic it's
important in history so of course first
times are very important in history wars
are important in history discoveries are
important in history these are historic
people or historic events or historic
places right we can use historic as an
adjective to describe many different
things so historic people historic
places historic events
okay next one six
to go into this woman is walking into
what is another word for that
is to enter she's entering the building
to enter the building when you go to
school you enter the school then you
enter your classroom means to go into a
place
next one
well these kids they want to be part of
an orchestra right they're practicing
they're all lined up they're playing
looks like a type of flute
to entertain people by playing music
so to entertain people by playing music
what word can we use perform
to perform now look this is a verb
to
perform
but we can also change this word to a
noun and we can say performance
okay
if we add a and c and we don't say two
we say
a
performance
that
then
becomes
a noun this is a noun because it is when
people get together and they play music
or they do something
to entertain other people we say it's a
performance what are they doing
they are performing okay so perform is
verb performance is noun okay next one
eight a group of people who watch or
listen to something so this is an
interesting word it's important word let
me make sure i teach you something very
important here because i hear a lot of
konglish okay
look at these people here all of these
people all of these people are are
looking at they're listening to the
music played by the orchestra now these
people are not musicians they are not
part of the orchestra we call them the
audience the audience but this is the
important thing
the audience is all of these people
not one
you cannot say he is an audience
no
he is not an audience he is part
of the audience the audience is a big
group the audience is a big
group
so don't say the audiences
clapped no the audience clapped but if
you want to talk about one person in the
audience you have to say audience
member
audience
member
if you want to talk about one person or
a few people you can say audience member
or audience members don't say the
audiences ah anio it's only one audience
it's one group it's like team right you
wouldn't say uh the the team kicked the
ball no
the team member kicked the ball okay
when we say team we're talking about a
group of people when we talk about
audience we're talking about the whole
group of people if you want to say one
or two people in that group you have to
say audience member or audience members
okay please be careful i hear a lot of
mistakes with that okay next one
a thin stick used to direct a musical
group i talked about this guy before
remember him he is a conductor but i
said he has a stick that he waves in
front of the audience like you go you
guys play okay you guys right and he'll
use that stick
to show the rhythm
or how people should play the music
right he uses stick what is the stick
called it's called a baton
baton a baton so the conductor
uses a baton when he conducts in an
orchestra a baton
okay next word
a person who performs and writes music
so if this boy can play the guitar but
he can also write the music some people
just play music somebody else wrote it
they read it on a paper and they play it
but if somebody who performs and writes
music what do we call them we call them
a musician okay now of course you they
don't just also have to write music many
musicians also just perform okay
somebody who performs music we can say a
musician somebody who writes music is a
composer
okay so but somebody who performs and
writes together we can say of course
they are a musician okay next one
a large number of people so a large
number of people what do we call that of
course we call that a crowd when there's
many many many people right so do you
say
or is that right okay that's many many
people together you can say it's a crowd
so if you go to a baseball game or a
soccer game the people the audience in
the stands that is a crowd of people
many people okay
next one to guide or control we say to
lead to guide or control something
we say is to lead maybe he is leading
his team
so to lead lead is an irregular verb so
it changes form in the past tense let's
see it goes lead lead lead
so when we talk when we use this verb in
the past we use lead lead lead
lead lead lead okay next one we're
talking about to make something happen
in a certain way to make something
happen in a certain way and we can see a
calendar here a calendar with many dates
on it and somebody's marked
the 14th and they did it with a love
sign right somewhere what is that that
looks to me like it's february
14th right i don't know but i'm guessing
because february 14th is
valentine's day
valentine's day so i think
this calendar is of february and 14th is
marked with a heart because it's
valentine's day when boyfriends and
girlfriends say i love you to each other
right but anyway so what are they doing
they're making something happen in a
certain way they are saying that on the
14th we're gonna have valentine's day
we're gonna have maybe a party or we're
gonna have a date or we're gonna do
something special for that day what are
they doing they are setting that day or
they are setting a uh something an event
that will happen in a certain way so to
set set is an irregular verb it doesn't
change form in the past set set set is
the verb next one a large room for
meetings or concerts so it's a large
room where people can have meetings they
can have concerts what do we call that
room that room is called a hall and many
times you can see the word music hall
concert
hall those words usually go together
okay so a hall can be a large room
where a performance
or a meeting is held
okay next one
wow look at that
many many lights to become full in this
case full of lights we can say to fill
these lights
fill the space
if that's the sky stars fill the sky
right so if you uh or if you there are
many people a crowd of people will fill
the hall they make it full there's no
more room okay
next one to move slowly on water or in
the air look at this balloon it's a big
balloon or ball filled with air right it
stays on the top of the water if we put
helium right some gas in this ball and
let it go maybe it will go up in the air
what do we say it is floating
so something can float on the surface of
the water but if something flies just in
the air you know it doesn't have any uh
control it just kind of floats in the
air like soap bubbles
you blow in all the little bubbles they
float away in the air and clouds clouds
will float in the air some balloons will
float so to float to move slowly on
water or in the air
okay
those are our words lots of words to
remember right
let's see how well you remember
what those words mean here we have
exercise one
our job is to complete each sentence
with a word from the box
so we have sentences here we'll have
eight sentences
we have a blank in each sentence we need
to fill those blanks with these words
let's review the words first we have
conductor
conductor
next
instrument
instrument
next
orchestra
orchestra
the next one is
historic
historic
next one
performed
performed now notice that performed
past tense right because our root is
here our basic word is here perform but
it's past tense we use performed okay
next one
audience
audience
next one is
concert
concert and finally we have
enter
enter that's easier right okay let's
take a look number one
the pianist remember a pianist is
someone who plays the piano the
pianist's first peep
was held last year
so think about this the pianist what
does the pianist do when a musician and
it doesn't matter if it's one four
people or many people
uh they
entertain
an audience
with music what do we call that it's a
noun right we say
it's a concert right the pianist's first
concert was held last year because here
we're looking for
it's like a performance concert and
performance are the same but don't get
confused because performed here is a
verb it's not performance right concert
is the word we're looking for that is a
noun to talk about the performance or
the uh event that a musician plays to
entertain people okay number two
the only musical beep i can play
is the piano so the piano is a type of
this remember when we talked about this
word i said there are many types of
these they're devices that people play a
guitar
a flute a tuba right the big tuba or a
violin
in this case a piano the only musical
what the only musical
instrument the only musical instrument i
can play is the piano i can ask you
can you play
a musical instrument say no i can't play
any musical instrument or
the only
instrument i can play is the piano or
the guitar or the flute or whatever most
people can play a drum right maybe not
well but you can play the drum okay next
one number three
i wanted to beep the room but the door
was locked well think about that you
want to do something with the room
you obviously want to maybe go inside
the room but you can't because the door
is locked if the door is locked you
cannot go into the room go into what
word means to go into
a place what word here
ah you're probably looking for this one
right here right enter i wanted to enter
the room but the door was locked you
can't enter when the door is locked okay
next one number four
last night she peep a concerto on the
piano a concerto by the way is a type of
performance okay so uh it's a type of
musical piece that people will play and
she did it on the piano so when somebody
plays music
another word for that verb right and she
did it last night so it's in the past
tense right what do we say what verb
means to play
uh some type of performance right like a
concert or a performance if you do that
you're performing last night she
performed
a concerto on the piano okay so she
performed she performed a concert or in
this case a concerto
a performance on the piano but if you
say she performed a performance
that sounds a little weird it's okay but
perform performance too similar so we
say concert or something else okay
number five all the people watch the
beep event on television the what event
what kind of event
on television and all the people watched
it so it was very important right it was
very important what kind of event can
you watch on television a conductor
event that doesn't make sense an
orchestra event that's weird what about
a historic event ah all the people watch
the historic event on television that
makes sense that's correct okay so if
it's a historical event it's very
important in history many people will
watch it
six he is the beep of this musical group
so we need one person right
a word that describes a person in a
musical group remember one type of
musical group is an orchestra
well what is one person in an orchestra
one person an audience no
an audience is a group of people right
so it's not audience
can it be
conductor
he is the conductor of this musical
group that's the only word there that
describes one person of a musical group
and remember audience is not part
it's not part of the musical group and
also remember audience is a group of
people not one person we can't say he is
the audience that doesn't make sense
okay unless the audience is only one
person right only one person watching
that would make sense but of this
musical group well actually that could
that could be a possible but in this
case we're looking for conductor okay
next one
seven
there was a large beep in the music hall
there was a large what in the music hall
what are we looking for
we're probably looking for
how many people came to see the concert
so there was a large think about a if
there was a crowd of people many people
came to see the concert and they
gathered in the music hall many people
who watch a musical performance we call
them of course the audience there was a
large audience in the music hall so
audience is better for this sentence
here
eight
a full-size beep is called a
philharmonic so there we have a little
bit
of answer as to what philharmonic means
right we're talking about the new york
philharmonic
what is it it's an orchestra but it's a
full-size orchestra that means that an
orchestra with all the different
instruments all the many people
who play those different instruments if
you have a certain number of people
playing certain instruments we call that
a philharmonic so philharmonic is a type
of orchestra okay let's uh stop there of
course that's the end of our exercises

back and we'll look at the reading and
the reading will be about the new york

subject of lesson 10 we're going to talk
about robots specifically we're going to
talk about the worker of the year so
let's focus on let's learn about robots
yeah sounds interesting right
think about different kinds of robots
different kinds of robots and different
things that robots can do so two things
right different kinds of robots and the
things that those robots do are you
ready let's first take a look at a
picture here this is a kind of a
confusing picture isn't it what is it it
looks like something maybe out of matrix
the movie matrix right what we can see
is a lot of machinery right there's a
lot of
machinery oops let's write that slowly
of course you know the word machine but
we're going to say machinery
because when we talk about many machines
working together we can say machinery
and these are actually what kind of
machines they are robots and they're in
a factory and they build things like
cars or big pieces of
big things that we use okay so this this
is a factory and there's a lot of
machinery and there's a many robots in a
factory okay let's begin now with the
vocabulary our first word oh no that's
too bad right she's falling down she
made a mistake what is another word for
mistake we can say
error that's a little himduro because
you have the two r's
error
error
and error
is a mistake if you make a mistake you
make an error okay so she made an error
and that's too bad i hope it doesn't
hurt right okay next one now here a
person who has something of course you
know this uh type of scene of you've
been to coffee shops or you've been to
stores many times the person behind the
counter or in the store is a person who
has something they are the owners
sometimes they're the owners the owner
of the store or the owner of the coffee
shop of the restaurant whatever the
person who owns the place that is the
owner they're not always the owner
sometimes they are the worker right but
somebody who has something
do you have anything
if you have something like your book bag
or your pencil
you are the owner you are the owner of
your bag or your pencil or your book
right or your toy or your video game you
are the owner because you have it you
have something okay next one
something made by people to do work
that's a head scratcher something made
by people to do work what is it we
talked about it before it's a machine
right i told you machinery is when you
have many machines working together in
one place we call it machinery but one
is a machine it's something people make
it to do work for them of course our
modern lives are very easy because we
have many machines that do our work a
car is a machine
that does our work we don't have to walk
right walking is work right but we can
ride so the machine does our work for us
right
okay next one
looks interesting like a detective is
looking for something something that
helps to solve a problem you guys know
sherlock holmes do you know sherlock
holmes i hope so
sherlock holmes is a very
famous
detective in british
literature right sherlock holmes is a
very famous detective a detective goes
to the scene of a crime and he looks
with the magnifying glass he tries to
find information that will help him
solve a problem what do we call those
little pieces of information we call
them a clue a clue and if you have many
usually you have many clues
right detectives look for clues at the
scene of a crime maybe not just one but
maybe there are several fingerprints
maybe old clothes
blood oh i wonder what happened right
but these are clues that help us to
solve a problem especially when we want
to know who did something okay okay next
one
holiday oh very nice right do you want a
holiday is it time for a holiday maybe
you think so this is a very nice place
to take a holiday what's another word
for holiday we can say vacation
vacation
vacation
okay so actually it's interesting
british people british english they
usually say they're going on holiday i'm
going on holiday americans are more
commonly say vacation i have a vacation
coming up i'm going on vacation so we go
on
go
on
holiday or go on a vacation british
people will say go on holiday i am going
on holiday americans will say i'm going
on a vacation or you could just say i'm
going on vacation that's okay too okay
next one
okay what's going on here do you know
how to play tennis do you have a tennis
coach
if a person tells someone how to do
something there's a verb for that you're
probably thinking teach right teach is
good that's that's true but there's
another word
that means to tell someone how to do
something what is that word you may not
have heard of it before it's direct but
if you think about it you have heard
this word before especially if you like
movies right
when people make movies there are many
actors and actresses right well there's
a person in charge who's telling the
actors and actresses how to act how to
perform in the movie we call that person
a director a movie director
a movie director because that is a
person who directs the actors and
actresses
on how to do something so direct is also
used when we want to say that something
is telling another person how to do
something someone or something is
telling another thing or person how to
do something
that is direct and usually direct is is
on the spot right it's telling someone
how to do something right now okay of
course you can also use teach right but
it's a little bit different right
teachers usually give you knowledge
directors tell you how to do something
right now okay so it's a little bit
different but they're very similar okay
next one
seven having many parts what is that
okay it looks like art is it a type of
machine what do you think it does
maybe it maybe it makes people invisible
that would be cool huh but i don't know
what it does but anyway
it's having many parts there are a lot
of parts on it right it looks what does
it look it looks very complex it looks
very complex
complex means it has many parts it's uh
very uh
so many different parts it's very
difficult to figure out it's complex
another word complicated right
complicated you could also use that word
come
ted
complicated complicated well that's a
complex word it has many letters okay so
that's very interesting complex has many
parts it's complicated it has many parts
it's very difficult to figure out okay
next one
oh oh this guy's stupid what's he doing
joshua hey how does she
right he's smoking and these are fire
crackers if that ash falls
he's going to blow up he's crazy right
dangerous what's another word for
dangerous
whoa this is a complex word
hazardous
hazardous
hazardous of course if you just say
hazard hazard is danger ous means it's
an adjective you're describing some
place or some situation hazardous oh
that place is hazardous or that
situation is hazardous
extremely extremely
normal right extremely hazardous this
guy is crazy he's not very smart okay
next one
oh no she looks like she's tired very
tired what's another word for very tired
we say fatigued
fatigued
fatigued that's a little difficult if
you are fatigued you are very tired
maybe she's been doing her homework too
much she's very tired she is fatigued
okay next one
a person who works
now a lot of people a lot of
workers have very difficult jobs right
they work with their hands they lift
things they use tools to do things what
do we call them we call them workers
right just a worker a worker for example
a construction worker construction is a
kung sujung right kung soo jiang
that's construction area right so a
person who works there is a worker
construction worker but you can also say
office worker right office worker you
could also say that so people who work
are called workers very easily that's
very easy word okay
next one to give something in exchange
for money so in this picture
this person looks like he's helping them
to
i almost said the word i don't want to
say it yet okay he want they want to get
rid of their house but they're not going
to give it away they're going to
what they're going to
sell their house right they're going to
sell their house and look at the word
the the word in the picture here sold
cell is an irregular verb so we say sell
sold sold because it's passed they sold
the house they exchanged the house for
money they didn't give away the house
right they want money in return for the
house have you ever sold something maybe
you had a like an old doll or an old toy
that you don't want anymore but you
don't want to throw it away maybe you
could sell it to a friend or maybe a
book or a video game that you you're
finished with you don't want it anymore
you might sell it to somebody else so
you exchange it
for money okay next one
what's this this is a machine that sucks
sucks
dirt and air off the floor so it's
right it sucks it up what do we call
this we call it a whoa that's a big word
vacuum
cleaner
vacuum cleaner okay you know this
machine right maybe you're playing your
game and your mom starts using the
vacuum cleaner like mom it's too noisy
right it drives you crazy but hey mom
has to clean right maybe you should use
the vacuum cleaner help mom out right so
that's good so don't complain if the
vacuum cleaner you hear the vacuum
cleaner and you're trying to do
something because you want to have a
clean house you don't want dirt all over
the floor dirt and dust and if you have
a dog little hair all over the floor you
want to be able to suck that air up with
a vacuum cleaner by the way the vacuum
cleaner is another machine right so it's
another example of many machines that
make our lives easier it does the work
for us it's very easy to use a vacuum
cleaner instead of a broom right broom
is
dirty and difficult to use vacuum
cleaner is much easier yes it's noisy
but it's easier okay next one
to control a car now actually the word
is in this picture right if the the word
is drive and we can see that word right
here drive right but this word is driver
so of course in english many verbs we
can change to noun and we can say the
person who does it right before we saw
work er
if we just use work that's a verb worker
is a person
drive is a verb driver is a person she
will be a driver she is learning she is
a student driver so she is learning to
drive to drive is to control a car it's
also an irregular verb so it changes
form for the past tense we say drive
drove
driven drive drove driven
okay so that is to control a car it's to
drive a car can you drive a car probably
not yet but don't try it's dangerous
right it's hazardous but when you're
older you can learn how to drive a car
but be careful always it's a dangerous
machine it's a hazardous machine be
careful be safe and you'll be okay okay
a very large sea so if you can see water
water all around for as far as you can
see and maybe it takes you days to sail
across that sea we call that an ocean
right there are only a few
big oceans in the world right there are
only a few and they're very big like a
pacific ocean the atlantic ocean the
indian ocean right we call those really
big areas of water we call them an ocean
smaller areas are called seas like the
mediterranean sea the caribbean sea
right those are smaller areas of water
next one a short time to rest before we
talked about workers right workers are
people who do work well they can't work
all the time right we need to take a
break we need to drink something or to
eat something or go to the bathroom in
that case we need to take a break take a
break right
take
a break so we usually use it in this
expression let's take a break do you
want to take a break hey everybody it's
time to take a break so take a break
means to stop working and to rest for a
little bit okay
next one wow
that's great if you can throw a dart and
you can hit exactly in the center
no mistake
no error you have hit it perfectly
perfect it's perfect no mistakes it's
perfect it is perfect so that is a
perfect shot in this case we would say
it's a perfect shot perfect right on
the middle a dot it's perfect
okay let's go over our vocabulary
exercises now how well do you remember
the words we just studied what we're
going to do here is we have many
sentences we need to choose the word
that best fits in the blanks in these
sentences
so these are our words here we have
eight words let's review those before we
look at the exercises the first word is
error
error
okay next is
owner
owner
the next one is
machine
machine
the next one is
clue
clue
the next one
vacation
they
vacation vacation okay
complex
complex
next one
hazardous
hazardous hazardous
next one is
direct
direct
okay let's take a look at these
sentences and figure out which word
belongs in those blanks okay number one
the peep
of this tall building is very rich
okay so usually people are rich and
think about it if someone
has a tall building if someone has a
tall building a tall building wow that's
a lot of money that person is very rich
so what do we call a person who has
something whether it's a tall building
or just a small pencil we call that
person the owner the owner by the way we
use the because there's only one
there's only one owner of the building
okay the owner of the building right if
there's a pencil somebody owns that
pencil who is that person that's only
one person so we don't say a owner of
the pencil that's weird because a means
one of many but there's only one owner
of this particular pencil so we say the
owner of this pencil if only one person
owns the building then it's the owner of
the building now it's true many people
can own a building that's true and we
could say one of the owners of this
building but in this case we're talking
about the owner that means there's only
one person so usually we use the with
owner because usually there's only one
person who owns something okay
if there are many people who own the
building then we can say one of the
owners but in this case there's just one
person he's very rich wow okay two
you should push
push this button to turn on this what
what do you turn on by pushing a button
what thing here is turned on by pushing
a button usually when you push a button
it
makes electricity go to a certain thing
it's probably a thing that uses
electricity to do people's work so what
do we call that thing we call that thing
a machine right a machine usually you
push a button and it turns on think
about your computer your computer is a
machine you push a button it turns on
your vacuum cleaner is a machine usually
you can push a button on the vacuum
cleaner sometimes they have a switch but
it's a switch or a button you push it
and it turns on okay
okay so that's a machine number three i
asked him to beep the project you asked
him to do what with the project now what
word would fit in there if you want
somebody to
take control of a project right
you want him to direct the project and
to tell other people what to do so he
tells other people what to do on the
project you asked him to direct the
project
okay next slide
four five and six
number four i'm going to visit cheju
island chajudo have you ever been to
cheshire but anyway i'm going to visit
cejado island during the summer beep now
when people have time off right and they
want to go on a
holiday right they usually go somewhere
they have a holiday destination another
word for holiday especially during the
summer when you don't have to go to
school we can say summer vacation
summer vacation you also have a winter
vacation it's good being a student right
you have a lot of time off in the summer
you have a lot of time off of school in
the winter we can call it summer
vacation or winter vacation what will
you do
in the summer vacation or what will you
do during the winter vacation okay so
occasion winter vacation this person is
going to visit cejado
on their summer vacation okay or during
their summer vacation number five the
problem was more peep than i
thought
so think about this there's a problem
right and it's more something than you
think if you think okay i have a problem
maybe you think i'm going to solve it
it's going to be easy but then you see
the problem like oh wow this problem has
many more parts
or many more uh
things about it that i didn't think
about so it is more what than i thought
what is something that has many parts to
it it's more complex than i thought this
problem is more complex
than i thought before i thought it was
easy but then i start doing the problem
oh my gosh it's more complex than i
thought it's more difficult than i
thought okay number six i have no beep
to help me solve the problem if you want
to solve you want to solve a problem
right you need some information that
will help you find the answer we talked
about that right what is something
something that helps people solve a
problem little things here and there
what is something that would help people
like sherlock holmes solve the problem
of like a crime scene who did it right
so what word fits there i have no clues
i have no clues to help me solve the
problem right you could say i have no
clue but usually clues there's more than
one clue at a uh for a problem there are
usually many clues but you could say i
have no clue or usually it's more common
to say i have no clues to help me solve
this problem now sometimes people will
say do you know the answer and a very
common expression is well i don't have a
clue i don't have a clue that's kind of
just a set expression that people will
say i don't even have one single clue i
don't have a clue or he doesn't even
have a clue means he's kind of dumb he
doesn't understand how to do the problem
but don't use that okay expression he
doesn't have a clue better to say let's
help him okay let's help him solve the
problem okay next two seven and eight
i felt foolish when i made an beep in my
calculations well right there and we
know that it's going to start with a
vowel right but
what what's the other part of the
sentence that we can use to figure this
out i felt foolish when i made a when do
you feel foolish
when do you feel foolish you may feel
foolish embarrassed oh i'm sorry right
you feel foolish when you make a mistake
right when you make a mistake especially
in your calculations sounds like
somebody's doing a complex math problem
so they made a mistake what's another
word for mistake
over here right i felt foolish when i
made an error in my calculations you
make a mistake in your calculations oops
that was dumb now i feel foolish okay
next one eight if a place is beep then
you shouldn't go
because you might
get hurt
you might get hurt it's a dangerous
place what's another word for dangerous
of course it has the same ending as
dangerous
we're looking at this word
if a place is hazardous then you
shouldn't go because you might get hurt
remember hazardous is a dangerous place
or situation in this case it's a place
if a place is hazardous don't go there
you might get hurt and hazardous means
the same thing as dangerous
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
section of this lesson let's take a
short break we'll come back and do the
reading
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary i'm brian stewart well
we're continuing on our theme of robots
and have you ever wondered about where
robots came from well in this lesson
we're going to find out because we're
going to talk about early robots we're
going to learn about the history of
robots where did robots come from
what kind of robots were the first
robots well let's take a look at a
picture first and we can see a lot of
different
examples of early robots you know the
first robots that came out right it
looks like
this machine this is all the robot yes
because it all controlled this little
robot bird up here on the top right look
at how ugly that is and all that
machinery just for this tiny little
robot at the top right and of course
robots have been famous in uh storybooks
and cartoon books uh like this here uh
there's been different types of robots
of course early robots used in factories
for lifting things up uh different
different things i'm not really sure
what this is
now this is not a robot this is a person
it's a person an astronaut on the moon
but the the people who went to the moon
the astronauts on the moon in the 1960s
used robots to help them get around on
the moon and also to help them guide
their spacecraft and build the
spacecraft to the moon without robots
people would not have been able to go to
the moon
here we can see some early robot legs
right a little robot play dogs i think
this is called ibo right the little
japanese are robot dogs that were very
popular
a few years ago and of course maybe you
have one of these in your home this is
an example of a robot vacuum cleaner
that goes around and cleans up the um
the dust and the dirt in your home okay
so these are all examples of early
robots this is not so early but it's
still kind of a simple robot so these
pictures all show different stages in
the history of robots
okay we have our first word here and it
looks like she's having fun right she's
going around and around she's to turn
around on a center and what is she on by
the way she's on a merry
go
round she's on a merry-go-round that's
what we call this uh
play
toy
at a playground it's a merry-go-round
and what is she doing the merry-go-round
just turns around on a center so what is
it doing it is rotating to just turn
around and around and there's a center
right so you have the center and you're
turning around on the center you're just
rotating to rotate around the earth
rotates around on its center right so um
to rotate is just to turn around around
like on a merry-go-round actually when
you think about it on the earth we're
all on a very big merry-go-round aren't
we but we don't feel it
okay next one
uh the foot of an animal
oh this is kind of cute right do you
have a dog right sometimes you can say
okay hello hello and the dog will shake
hands with you it's a trick right so
when you do that you take the dog's what
the foot of an animal we we don't really
call it a foot there's a special word
for it for animals not for people but
for animals we call it a paw
a paw dogs have a paw
bears have a paw lions have a paw but be
careful of the lions paw they're very
dangerous right but dog's paws are cute
right you can hold them say hello doggy
right
you can train your dog to shake hands
or shake paws okay next one
oh who's this guy uh he looks maybe you
don't know who he is okay it's getting a
little bit old now but uh he is
imitating a famous speaker he
is imitating elvis presley if you don't
know who that is
ask your mom or dad they'll know he's a
famous singer an amer famous american
singer elvis presley uh he's a very deep
voice like
you know he sings kind of like that okay
but elvis presley to imitate what's
another word for that to
mimic
to mimic
is to copy or imitate somebody imitate
also means to copy but a copy is like
you know if you're going to copy
something you copy a book on a machine
but if you're going to behave or dress
or act in the same way as somebody else
it's better to use mimic instead of copy
right if you mimic somebody mimic is
specifically for a person who is copying
the actions or behavior of another
person that is mimic so when you copy or
behave the actions of another person you
are imitating them okay you are
mimicking them to mimic somebody okay
next one
a wheel with teeth so these are wheels
right but they have teeth not teeth that
are going to bite you right but teeth
that catch onto other teeth and turn
them around and these things like you
turn this one it will turn that one and
it will turn that one and you can find
these things in many machines this is
how many machines are able to do work
with
these gears with a gear in fact in your
car you have different gears different
speeds on your bicycle you have
different gears right you can change the
gear on a fancy bicycle so if you're
going up a hill or down a hill you can
change the gear to go faster or to have
more power when you pedal it so gears
are very important for many different
machines they're just basically wheels
with teeth on them
okay to lift something up to lift
something up what are they doing they
are raising so to raise
parts of a
building to help them build that
building
they are raising something to lift
something up you raise something
what do you raise every day in school
you raise your hand i hope you raise
your hand you should raise your hand in
class ask your teacher questions if you
don't know the answer raise your hand
lift it up okay
a bird with a heavy body and short legs
you see these birds everywhere
especially in the city right they're
going
and they and they get the the bread or
they get the little things from the uh
ground and they go
right what are they they are pigeons
pigeons but they're kind of dirty birds
right don't touch them you know maybe
you can throw them food but you know
don't chase them don't try to touch them
because that that's not good for your
health actually but these are called
pigeons and unfortunately they go hua
jiung chill everywhere right they go to
the bathroom all over the place and it's
little white uh
places on the ground so they are pigeons
hopefully they don't fly over you oh no
that's terrible right but pigeons are
everywhere okay
what in the world is this guy doing
important and respected the word is
impressive now
maybe that's up to your opinion
okay if i look at this guy i don't think
impressive i think silly or foolish okay
but let's say there's an important
politician or uh important person gives
a speech let's say we're talking about
like for example martin luther king do
you know who that is
martin luther king was a very important
leader in america
uh history in the civil rights movement
he was a black preacher who spoke for uh
equal rights for black people and white
people in fact people of all races and
all ages and all sexes and he was a very
impressive speaker he was important many
people respected him he was impressive
okay
usually some politicians are impressive
unfortunately not all politicians are
impressive actors can be impressive if
you wow that that person really is a
good actor then you respect that person
they are impressive okay if you're an
artist maybe you think that's impressive
other people might think it's kind of
silly but you know it's a matter of
opinion really okay so impressive is
important and respected
next one
of the present time
of the present time
in this case they're talking about the
style the style is a reflection or it
shows the present time it is
modern style of course you know you can
talk about old-fashioned style when you
go into houses or buildings you look at
the the decorations you can say oh this
is old-fashioned or some of them they
might look very modern very clean very
simple uh modern style okay so modern it
just means of the present time but
modern doesn't just mean be careful it
doesn't just mean the decoration on the
inside of a building it can also mean
the way that people are thinking oh
that's modern thinking or it's modern
behavior or it's a modern machinery or
it's a modern movie so modern just means
of the present time it's an adjective
used to describe many different things
next one a type of tall plant with white
or colored flowers and it looks like
this do you know what type of flower
this is this flower is called a lily
lily
my wife her favorite flower is the
purple lily so i have to remember that
otherwise i get in trouble if i forget
right but anyway lily is a very
beautiful and impressive flower so you
could say wow uh a lily can be an
impressive flower because it's very
beautiful okay
a person who makes and repairs oops
that's a little mistake there we'll just
check that out a person who makes and
repairs clocks so this person
when they're
making a clock or they're repairing a
clock we call them a clock maker that's
very simple right
makes
clocks clock maker how simple is that
we're just putting two words together to
make one word clock
maker clockmaker you can also say watch
maker people who make watches be careful
oh that's a good thing this is not a
clock
do not say that this is a clock this is
not a clock that's konglish okay this is
a watch okay so watch
a clock is on the wall right if you have
a clock on the wall that's a clock this
is a watch don't say i have a clock on
my wrist what that's a big clock on your
wrist that's very heavy it's very
strange how do you put on your shirt
it's crazy right so don't put a clock on
your wrist put a watch on your wrist but
we can say watch maker or clock maker
kind of the same thing they do the same
things really and they can probably do
both right so you say he's a clock maker
or he's a watchmaker okay so clockmaker
or watchmaker but remember the
difference between clock and watch
they're not the same
okay
whoa what happened here this guy looks
very
uh
what is he looks very surprised
something that is not expected is
surprising now be careful here do not
say he is surprising that's not right
he
is
sur
right be careful he is not surprising
don't use ing to describe him use ed to
describe him he is surprised the message
the message is surprising okay so we use
surprising to describe the thing that
makes him
surprised
okay
and we do that with all sorts of
adjectives like that for example let's
take another one a boring
do you say i am boring no i say the book
is boring it makes me bored i am bored
the book that i'm reading it's boring so
if i read a book it's boring it makes me
bored don't say he is boring or i am
boring because if you do that what
you're saying is that i am boring i make
other people bored
right don't say i am boring right uh say
i am bored okay he is surprised not
surprising he is surprised because the
message is surprising
okay so the thing that makes somebody
feel a certain way is ing
the person's reaction is edie it's a
good way to remember okay the person's
reaction is ed the thing that causes
that is ing okay cause is ing reaction
is ed okay so boring board surprising
surprised confusing confused please
don't make a mistake now notes that's a
very common mistake okay the next word
here is unusual so something may have
pushed this boy down but it's something
unusual means it's not common not
ordinary
not some maybe something that's not
usual that doesn't normally happen so
another word for unusual is strange but
it's interesting to note that strange
may be a little bit of a negative uh
word when we say unusual it doesn't mean
negative positive it's just unusual it's
just not ordinary but strange has a
little bit of a negative meaning you say
if you say that's strange you may have a
little bit of a negative meaning to it
but strange just means unusual not
normal if you say
a strange force push the boy down it's
not an ordinary force it's not a usual
thing okay so let's move on where your
ribs and heart are of course some of you
guys might do that do you play soccer
right you can bounce it off your what
off your chest
right that's fine you cannot bounce it
off your arms but in soccer you can hit
the ball or football you can hit the
ball with your legs of course with your
chest or with your head but no hands
only the goalie can use his hands but
usually you cannot use it so he's using
his chest to hit the ball it's where his
ribs right and his heart boom boom boom
are located where your ribs and your
heart are located that's your chest
okay
made of wood if we say something is made
of wood we can just say one word to

happy she's feeling happy she's got a
lot of money in her hands right so she
can go buy something that she wants

she's pleased that's her reaction to the
money so this is another example right
it is pleasing to have a lot of money
the money is pleasing to her she is
pleased she is feeling happy she is
pleased remember ed is the reaction her
reaction to the money she is pleased not
she is pleasing no the money is pleasing

about this it's a wheel with teeth and
like i said these are very important for
many machines they help those machines

example of your bicycle on your bicycle
you have the chain that goes around one
of these wheel with teeth and in fancy
bicycles you can change the position
right to get more power or to get more
speed what is that thing
they are of course gears and there are
many gears you have to use s because
many gears in a clock and if you look
inside the clock there are many gears
that make the hands move and tell the
time
and remember
this is a watch
not a clock okay actually i don't know
if there are any gears in here some
watches like this one are a little bit
modern right they're electronic so it's
all electronic there are no gears
but many clocks have
mechanical gears that work
and they move the hands on the clock
there are many gears in a clock okay
number three
the boy couldn't beep his arms because
he was sick

boy is sick he can't do what with his
arms his arms are going to stay here

what's another word for lift what's
another word for lift here another word
is raise the boy couldn't raise his arms

okay next one number four
in beep society people live longer so
this is comparison right because we're
saying longer longer than what
well if we think about it in society
nowadays
these days don't say in these days just
say these days these days people live
longer than before then traditional
society what's the opposite of
traditional it would be modern in modern
society remember i said we can use
modern to describe many different things
not just the decorations inside a
building but also the way people think
our lifestyles our society in modern
society people live longer than they did
before
okay next one number five
people can use a beep to send messages
through the air now we didn't talk about
this but i i when i when i described
this word i said you see them everywhere
right and i said they're kind of dirty
don't touch them right but i also said
be careful because they go to the
bathroom all over the place but but by
the way they are also used a long time
ago people would tie messages to their
feet and release them and they would fly
from one place to another
what kind of animal does that
of course we're talking about pigeons
people can use a pigeon to send messages
through the air and a long time ago
people did use
pigeons you know before telephones
before the telegraph
of the best way to send a message was
with a pigeon right released the pigeon
and the pigeons were trained they knew
where their homes were so they would go
to their home you take them away from
the home release them they would go back
to their home and people would catch
them oh there's a message and they would
read the message
six the earth beep around the sun
now i talked about this before when i
was talking about a merry-go-round and i
said the earth was doing this by itself
but it's also doing this around the sun
what is it doing it is of course it is
rotating the earth rotates around the
sun so you could say the earth also
rotates because it moves around the
center the center is the sun the earth
is moving around the center so it's
rotating around the sun but it also
rotates on its axis
okay
seven the boy can beep his uncle
perfectly
so here we're looking for a word that's
that means copy right
uh maybe his uncle has a certain way of
talking hello kids how are you doing
today you know maybe a funny way of
talking and the boy can copy that
perfectly sometimes people do that maybe
your friends can copy famous actors or
people on television and they copy them
really well what are they doing they're
imitating those people they are
mimicking those people so the boy can
mimic his uncle perfectly he can copy
his behavior very very well
okay number eight
the president made and beep speech last
night so the president made what kind of
speech
what kind of speech can the president
make something that's respective
something that maybe is important
something that gets a lot of attention
right there the president made an
impressive speech last night so that
would be that would fit and of course
and because you have i there and
impressive speech last night okay well
that wraps up the vocabulary section of
the lesson let's take a short break come
back and see how those words are used in
the reading passage don't go away
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary i'm brian stewart hey
we're continuing on our subject about
robots in fact we're talking about robot
actors in this lesson robot actors so
we're going to learn about
some robots in movies wow exciting right
maybe your favorite subject who knew
english could be so fun right so this is
a good subject do you know this movie of
course you do it's transformers
everybody knows the transformers
this is a good movie as an example to
show robots as actors in movies and
that's what this lesson is about today
let's take a look though at the
vocabulary so let's start whoa i'm sorry
we went from a very exciting picture to
a very difficult picture what is all
this math
and look at this boy he looks very
serious doesn't he okay
someone who is very smart someone who is
very smart like if this boy can do all
of these math problems i don't even know
what these math problems are if he can
do those he is a genius he's a genius
genius are you a genius are you really
really smart in math are you really
smart in languages or maybe you're smart
in something else
there are different types of geniuses
right so
maybe you're a genius in one area or
another okay so the a person who's very
smart is a genius
okay
next one
far away so if that city is really far
away we can say it is distant
distant uh if you see mountains very far
away those mountains are distant distant
far away
okay next one
to change into something else
okay so a long time ago this was all
rock but water and wind came through and
changed these rocks into very
interesting shapes what happened they
transformed
transform
trans of course is a cross and form is
shaped so across different shapes
transform this is a verb to change to
change into something else remember the
movie uh poster we saw at the beginning
transformers of course those are about
robots that can change their shape
into something else and we'll read about
that in the passage
whoa there's a funny guy right he's a
funny looking guy
maybe he wants to hide himself to hide
yourself by looking different right he
doesn't look like that he doesn't have
such big eyebrows he doesn't have a big
nose or a mustache but he put it on
maybe he wants to hide who he really is
so what is he doing he is disguising
to disguise yourself right also disguise
can be a noun also right but here it is
a verb in this definition
to hide that is a verb but it can also
be a noun the glasses with the big nose
and the mustache that is a disguise so
you put on a disguise you can put on
put on
a
disguise so you can use disguise as a
verb or as a noun if you use it as a
noun you can say put on a disguise put
on a disguise and disguise can be closed
too if you want to hide your true
identity you don't want anybody to know
who you are put on a disguise disguise
yourself
okay next one
hey you know this guy right that's
spider-man the amazing spider-man
he's the good character in a story now
unfortunately in many stories spider-man
people think he's a bad guy right but
spider-man's really he's really the good
guy who is he he's the hero he's the
hero of the movie the good character the
person who does good things and helps
other people that is the hero of the
movie okay now
movies usually have heroes but then also
movies have somebody who fights against
the hero the main bad character in a
story and these are the people who fight
against the hero right so movies of
course many movies show conflict you
have good and evil good guys bad guys
and they're fighting against each other
well the heroes are the good guys who
are the bad guys what do we call them we
can call them villain a villain is a bad
guy so villains are the bad characters
in movies the villains
are fighting the heroes of the movies
who wins
well usually in a movie the hero wins
right usually especially uh movies about
superheroes the good guy always wins
doesn't he or she there's lots of uh
female heroes too super uh action or
superheroes that are female as well so
it's a the the good guy or the good girl
who always wins in these types of movies
right but the villains usually lose
okay
not caring if you hurt others so if
somebody doesn't care if you hurt others
this is a bad thing right it's not a
good thing it's what the villain would
do right the villains are ruthless
ruthless is an adjective it's an
adjective it's used to describe
what somebody is like what is their
personality like what is their character
like they are ruthless it means they
don't care if they hurt other people
that's very bad right a person who
doesn't care if they hurt other people
that
right they just do what they want they
want to get what they want they don't
care about other people that's ruthless
it's bad that would be a villain a bad
guy or a bad character
okay
using great force to hurt others like in
this movie oh no he's kicking him right
there that looks very painful right so
what is this this is violent this is
violent action
violent is also an adjective it's an oh
that's so strange jay isn't it it's an
adjective uh violent it's a violent
scene it's a violent act he's a violent
person so we use violent as an adjective
in front of a noun to show that
something or somebody's using great
force to hurt other people it's a
violent movie it's a violent uh scene
it's a violent person okay so violent is
an adjective to describe person place
thing
okay next one
do you remember this movie i don't know
if you remember it it's a little bit old
right maybe before you were born i don't
know it's of course called robocop it
was a cool movie the first one right uh
there's been others too um but this is
robocop he's a he's a he's part human
part robot right part machine but he's
human inside and this of course is just
a robot to show as a main part now to
show as a main part we are to feature so
robocop features this character here and
also this is the bad guy in the end of
the movie this is also a part of the
movie to show as a main part the main
part of a movie especially is the
feature for example this is usually used
to describe the actors or actresses in a
movie for example you can say the new
movie is going to feature brad pitt that
means brad pitt will be a main part of
the movie you could also say the new
movie will feature new york which means
a place new york the setting the place
will be a main part of the movie so to
show as a main part it can be a person
it can be a thing it can be you know a
machine an animal it could be anything
really it's just a main part of
something it features that thing or that
person
okay
what we use to speak
and write
what am i using right now to speak to
you i'm using english right
what is english english is a language of
course you normally use korean to speak
and write that is your language right
now you are learning a different
language you're learning english so
language is what we use to speak and
write notice that this is not language
be careful these
i would call these letters
not alphabets
don't say these are alphabets these are
letters alphabet is the whole set of
letters from a to z in english the whole
set
is alphabet
individual
symbols are
letters okay and of course letters are
part of language these letters are part
of the english language these letters
are a feature of the english language
okay so yeah we work the vocabulary
together okay next one
oh what happened to him
i think he's drinking too much right
very dangerous
okay well he fell down and he's probably
pushing the horn a short high-pitched
sound so maybe it goes beep beep right
look at that that's the word some words
in english
are the same
as the sound that they make right so if
you push the horn on a car right the
horn on a car it makes a high-pitched
sound we say that sound is a beep and
that's what it sounds like it's beep
beep
the sound and the word are the same
sometimes we hear that right sometimes
that's true in english okay so that's a
good word there to show that the the
word and the sound are the same thing
okay
next to be successful in a game or fight
ah what happened here we can see what
happened very easily oh these two uh
ladies were playing a game one person is
going to do what one person is going to
win
the other person is going to
lose
so
who do you think won
who do you think lost
when is a past is a irregular verb so i
said one win won one
who won
she won obviously who lost oh lose
lost lost right
she lost okay so somebody will win
somebody will lose after the game who
won
she won
she lost okay so which team won that
team won that team lost
okay next word wow this is a big
airplane right this is a plane driven by
jet engines jet engine is here and here
now a long time ago
there were no jet engines planes used
propellers now i'm not a very good
artist so i'm trying to draw these
it looks like a flower doesn't it but
these things would spin really fast and
they would catch the air and push the
plane forward and these were called
propellers propeller
a propeller plane so we said propeller
plane or sometimes we will say prop
plane propeller plane or prop plane but
then of course technology improves now
we have jet engines what kind of plane
do we call that we call that a jet so
it's really the same thing a jet engine
it's a jet if it has a jet engine oh
there's two more over here too
don't forget those
okay if it has a jet engine it is a jet
okay
oh that's too bad what happened here a
problem or difficulty right there's a
problem with the engine in this car so a
problem or difficulty is trouble now
this is a good uh picture to show for
this word because in this case we can
say she has
car
trouble
and that's a very common expression
right she has car trouble do you have
car trouble if your car breaks down it's
a very common expression do you have car
trouble or she has car trouble okay
interesting expression
okay next a vehicle for carrying goods
now a vehicle for carrying goods this is
a special type of vehicle you would not
call this a car
it's not a car it's a
truck a truck is a big vehicle and it
has a big area a big space you can put
many things inside whether it's rocks
like this or sometimes it's all closed
and it has a roof and it has a door back
here and you can put stuff inside that's
a
tractor trailer okay uh that carries you
know like electronic goods from the
factory to the store or many other types
of products okay there's many different
kinds of trucks also a pickup truck
which is smaller one person uses and
they can put their furniture or their
tools in the back of the truck and drive
to the job but it's much smaller trucks
are different shapes and sizes
okay
oh you know this guy who is that you've
seen him in the movies before that's
george clooney so it's kind of an
interesting picture because here we have
oh i think i know her too she looks
familiar i can't remember her name she
was in the movie fargo okay so anyway
it's funny that they are famous famous
actor and famous actress they're
watching the movies which is the moving
picture movies these two people are
famous in the movies and they're in the
theater right now watching a movie so
let's go see a movie there's many
expressions we can use with movie let's
go see a movie go see
a movie
let's go see a movie okay also we say
movie theater movie
theater
okay a movie theater and that's where we
see moving pictures moving pictures is
not really a common expression anymore
it was a common expression when movies
were first invented because people
didn't know what movies were they knew
what pictures were and when the pictures
moved very quickly they called it moving
pictures oh it's moving pictures but
nowadays we don't say moving pictures
often we say movie
okay of course movies are very important
in our lives we probably watch many
movies
every week every month maybe even every
day don't watch too many movies though
it's not good for your brain okay take
it easy okay
now let's uh go over the vocabulary
exercises now how well do we remember
those words that we just learned here we
need to complete each sentence with a
word from the box so we have many words
in the box here and we have sentences on
this and the other slides that we need
to fill in the blank with the proper
word let's review the words real quick
the words in the box are first
g
sorry excuse me
genius
genius
that's better
distant
distant
transform
transform
disguised
disguised
next is hero
hero
then villain
next is
ruthless
ruthless
and then
violent
violent okay those are our words
where do we put these words in the
sentence which word goes with which
sentence let's find out number one
though she is little although she is
little even though she is little
she is a peep in mathematics
okay now this is kind of a strange thing
because it
doesn't really matter that she's little
i mean
uh maybe it's because maybe you could
say even though she is young she's
little maybe she's a little girl right
that they're talking about
you don't expect young children to be
very what in mathematics very smart yeah
you don't expect children to be very
smart in mathematics because most
children are just learning mathematics
but if you find a child
or some children or a girl a little boy
who is very good at mathematics we can
call them what they're very smart right
they are a genius in mathematics so even
though she's a little girl even though
she's young
uh she is a genius
in mathematics okay we don't expect that
so that's why we say though even though
it's not expected it's unexpected
number two the beep businessman made
little children work too much
that's a bad businessman
terrible he doesn't care about the
feelings or the the welfare of other
people it doesn't care about other
people he just wants to get what he
wants this is really bad bad person what
did we say about what is a what do we
just what word do we use to describe
people who don't care about other people
we say that those people are
ruthless they are ruthless so a ruthless
businessman will make children work too
much actually
just making children work is ruthless
right
and especially too much that's terrible
businessmen shouldn't make children work
at all children should not work they
should have fun and go to school right
they're learning they shouldn't work
until they get older right making
children work is ruthless
number three
the king beep himself as a beggar this
is interesting so imagine you sometimes
you hear about this in stories right
you hear about a king who wants to know
about the ordinary people so he wants to
change his appearance so nobody will
recognize him he wants to what he wants
to
disguise himself so the king disguised
himself as a beggar so he could go out
and talk to people normally so they
wouldn't think oh he's a king you know
they would tell him what they really
thought okay sometimes we hear stories
like that that's a common idea in many
stories okay number four
the magician magician a person who
performs magic tricks
the magician has an ability to beep into
a bird
what would a magician do
what can a magician do it can do
something into a bird to
perhaps change himself into a bird to
change his form into a bird and fly away
that would be a great magic trick right
well what word here means to change into
something else
of course you're probably looking at
this word here transform the magician
has an ability to transform into a bird
to change himself into a bird that's
pretty cool
five usually the beep in a movie does
not die
now think about that we're talking about
characters in the movie right we talked
about there are good characters and
there are bad characters the good
characters are the heroes the bad
characters are the villains
which ones usually don't die especially
in movies like superheroes and things
like that of course the hero in a movie
does not die usually doesn't say always
usually
in some movies yes the hero dies those
are sad movies right but usually action
movies or superhero movies the hero
doesn't die the hero wins right that's
what the movie's about good uh always
wins in those movies but the hero does
not die okay next one
even though he is a nice person so even
though despite
something unexpected right even though
he is a nice person he usually plays the
beep in movies so he's a nice person
but even though he's a nice person
despite that fact something unexpected
he usually plays and that means he acts
as what in the movies so we're looking
for something opposite of a nice person
what's the opposite of the nice person
or the good guy the opposite of course
is the villain right even though he is a
nice person he usually plays the villain
in movies so he's a nice actor
the person is nice but he plays a bad
guy in the movies right he plays a
villain that makes sense okay
seven i don't like to watch tv because
most programs are too what
are two what are most programs on
television maybe somebody doesn't like
it
uh maybe they don't like the people are
always fighting or that maybe somebody
dies what kind of movies are those those
are violent movies i don't like to watch
tv because most programs are too violent
that person doesn't like the violence on
the movies
number eight she lives in a beep city
it's the only word left okay of course
we're looking at this word she lives in
a distant city that means far away
moro
right
she lives in a far away city it's funny
in korean when i was learning korean
it's very uh chimichanga because in
korean you know you say yogi is here
chogi is over there and
is over there right so that would be
chagi would be like distance right far
away distance okay that's just
it's just kind of funny chummy soil okay
okay so that wraps up the vocabulary
section of this lesson let's take a
short break we'll come back and we'll do
the reading
[Music]
hello and welcome back to reading for
vocabulary i'm brian stewart
in this lesson lesson 13
we're going to talk about computer
movies we'll focus on thinking about
movies and books you know
also what kinds of characters are in
them so we're going to talk about
characters in movies but we're really
going to talk about special types of
characters what types of characters well
we'll find out later when we do the
reading but first let's talk about this
type of uh
movie characters that we have here now
this is kind of interesting did you see
this movie avatar did you ever wonder
how did they make the characters in the
movie well this picture kind of tells
you this is the real actor who played
this character in the movie avatar i'm
sorry i forgot her name but uh in the
movie but of course there's no creature
that looks like this right this is her
again
and this is what she looks like in real
life this is what she looks like in the
movie look at the difference isn't that
amazing how can they do that well they
use computer graphics and that's what
we're going to learn about in this
lesson
also you may have seen this movie do you
remember this movie this character here
my precious
right okay this character of course is
gollum from the lord of the rings is
there a really a person like that no of
course not there is not a person like
that the actor who played gollum
actually got an award for playing gollum
but nobody ever saw what he really
looked like he was wearing a suit right
with all these
lights on it and
when they put his image in the computer
they can make his image look like this
and who's that
of course that's
yoda i am right i'm sorry i'm not a very
good i can't imitate yoda very well but
this is yoda from star wars ex was kind
of silly seeing him jump around
you know with the lightsaber but that
was yoda again there's no real creature
like yoda there's not real again it was
computer graphics
so when we talk about these characters
in the movies we're going to be talking
about how they can make these types of
characters especially using computer
graphics okay well let's take a look at
one more picture from the movies and
this movie also kind of illustrates how
movie directors can make
scenes especially in the background of
course this person here is real and
probably the mask he's wearing on his
face is real but this scene in the
background that's not real right that's
a computer graphic it's probably a blue
screen right and what these people these
actors act in front of a colored screen
and then on the computer after they make
the film they can add all sorts of
interesting images in the background to
uh that blue screen that the actors are
actually acting in front of
okay well let's begin of course with our
first word on our word list for the
vocabulary now this is an interesting
picture
this character here of course there's no
such thing as a skeleton that can move
and and hold a lamp so that's not real
and if you saw something like that you
would be really scared wouldn't you
extreme fear what is extreme fear and
this is a word used to describe certain
types of movies that make you really
scared we call those
horror movies a horror movie is a movie
that makes you feel extreme fear it's
horror it's not just fear but horror
horror is like
okay very very very afraid or really
afraid horror is a strong degree of fear
extreme fear and if you ever saw
an actual skeleton that's moving you
would probably
be horrified you would be
you would feel horror okay
next one
kind of cute what is that can you see
the little boy here you see his hand and
you see his eyes there this is a very
simple
uh example of the word this is a very
simple costume
a costume is something you wear to look
special
what are they why would
the the kid here wear a costume like
this by the way this is just a bed sheet
a bed sheet
it's a sheet of cloth you put on your
bed mom took it maybe it's an old bed
sheet and she cut two holes in it for
the eyes that's a very simple costume
it's got a very cheap costume too but
it's a costume
costume now why would
a boy or girl wear a costume to look
special especially this type of costume
what's the event well in america of
course you may have heard of
halloween
halloween is a special day of the year
when kids wear costumes as monsters as
ghosts or as a popular movie characters
or even singers i heard that recently
like last year or the year before that
many american kids dressed up as psy
right the korean singer for halloween
and they go trick-or-treating they knock
on people's doors and they say trick or
treat and people will give them candy
especially they're dressed up in
different costumes so you know any
costume it can be like a monster it can
be a ghost or it can be famous people
too all sorts of different costumes out
there
next one
not real something that is not real this
man is looking at the money and trying
to think is this real or is it
phony is it phony a phony twenty dollar
bill or actually that looks it could be
a euro i'm not sure what currency that
is but if the money is not real if it's
phony it's worthless right unfortunately
there are bad people who make
fake copies of money and try to use it
as real money and it's phony money
there's another word that's very common
we use for that we say fake
if something is fake it's the same as
saying
phony not real it's fake it's not real
it's phony it's not real ph is is
pronounced as
phony okay so it's phony not real or
it's fake okay next one
okay now here we have a picture here
when i first saw this picture i'm like
wow is that real it looks so perfect
doesn't it it's a perfect town and then
looked at the boats and i'm like what
about this boat is that boat real but
yes it is real looking like something
real is realistic it is realistic and of
course it is real because there are
boats like that and you can see the
detail in the water everything here is
uh looking very realistic it is very
realistic we believe that this is an
actual picture and it probably is
realistic means looking like something
real
next one oh
what's wrong with him he's feeling fear
what can we say about him
is he
frightened he is frightened we wouldn't
say he is frightening no we wouldn't say
that we would say he's frightened
because that's his reaction to something
that is frightening be careful right we
may have talked about this before
frightening
use ing
for the thing that causes
someone to react
by being frightened
frightening
frightened we can also say he is scared
he is scared or he is afraid
right these are all synonyms for
frightened he's frightened he's afraid
he's scared he saw something that is
frightening okay so frightened means
that he is feeling fear
next one
now you know this painting right this is
a very famous painting uh painted by a
very famous
artist who lived in italy a long time
ago do you know
the name of this painting it's called
the mona lisa right and why is it such a
famous painting because it looks like a
real person or thing even though this is
just a painting it was painted a long
time ago and it was painted with such
skill that this woman it looks life like
it looks lifelike i just used that word
yeah lifelike it looks lifelike looks
like a real person or thing of course
the woman who modeled for this painting
she was real but it's amazing that the
artist's skill the talent that the
artist leonardo da vinci could paint
such a life-like picture of the actual
woman okay
okay next one
to tell the difference here we have a
picture of many people raising their uh
signs they're saying yes they're
agreeing but there's one person in the
middle says no
and they're different from the other
people that person we can distinguish
that person because we can easily see
the difference when you distinguish
distinguish
distinguish when you distinguish
something that means you can see the
difference
for example can you distinguish who is
the boss and who are the employees can
you tell can you see the difference can
you tell the difference between the boss
and the employees sometimes you can't
you have to watch and see how people act
then you can distinguish who the who's
the boss and who are the employees but
sometimes if you just look very quickly
you can't other things are very easy to
distinguish it's very easy to
distinguish if you see several people
and one person is blonde and the other
people have brown hair then you can
easily distinguish the blonde person
right away you can tell the difference
distinguish
okay
person has an idea it's represented with
this drawing we usually use this idea
light bulb a light bulb
is going turning on in her head a light
bulb is turning on in her head that's a
common idea
having new ideas and making new things
if somebody can do this many times
during the day
we call them creative because they have
many new ideas have new ideas or making
new things if you think of new ideas if
you can think of new ways to draw
or new ways to make something then
perhaps you are creative too also
authors are creative they come up with
different stories like jk rawlings who
wrote the harry potter series she's very
creative to think of all those
characters and all those new ideas for a
story right so there are many creative
people in the world they think of new
things and they make new things
okay number nine
this is very a beautiful landscape the
appearance
of a place so we're looking at the
principle like don't worry about the
woman
but we're looking about the appearance
you know very interesting distinguishing
mountains right but if we look at some
place
we say wow the beep is very beautiful we
say the scenery is very beautiful it's
the appearance of a place what a place
looks like if you go up into the
mountains it's very beautiful scenery
you go to the beach you look out over
the ocean and the beach the sand that's
beautiful scenery sometimes scenery
isn't so beautiful if you go to a train
station
scenery is not so good or if you go to a
town that there are many factories the
scenery is not so good so scenery
doesn't mean good or bad it's just what
things look like what is the scenery
where you live
okay
speed limit is 25
miles per hour in korea you would say
kilometers per hour
but it's the greatest amount of possible
and i said the word is actually right
here it's limit right the word we're
looking for is limit so limit means the
greatest amount possible that means the
greatest amount you can drive the speed
that you can drive in this area is 25
whether it's miles per hour or
kilometers per hour depends what country
you're in right but
it's the limit you can't go over that
you cannot go over that if you do you'll
get arrested right it's the greatest
amount possible in this case under the
law but it's the greatest amount
possible in a certain place it's the
limit
okay she's having a good good time right
she looks like she's having a party
causing great interest
that of course is exciting and look
cause the cause we use ing
the cause it's exciting her reaction
would be x i what x i
ted you got it good her reaction would
be excited the cause is exciting
something that causes great interest is
exciting her reaction is excited
okay
now this man what is he doing he looks
like he's about to go swimming right
he is standing on the end part of
something the end part of the deck right
that's the end what do we call that we
call that the edge he's standing on the
edge of the pool deck right be careful
don't stand
on the edge of a cliff right if you go
to see the grand canyon or if you go up
in the mountains and you have a good
view don't stand on the edge that's
dangerous don't stand on the end part
stay away from the edge okay but the
edge is the end there's no more land
you fall off okay in this case it's okay
he's gonna fall in the water and go
swimming but be careful of other edges
like on the edge of a cliff or at the
mountains
okay
oh you know him that's johnny depp right
he was the main character in the pirates
of the caribbean movies
a person who acts and plays our movies
what is johnny depp johnny depp is an
actor okay there are many famous actors
that you can probably name right away
like johnny dapp brad pitt george
clooney these are famous actors
sometimes however people will use actor
for women too
oh it actor is a person doesn't mean a
man
used to be actor was only man but now we
use that also to describe women before
they said actress but it's becoming more
and more common now people just say
actor for men and women okay
do you know this picture this is a
famous picture what is it a picture of
it's a picture of the loch huchness

it's in scotland in scotland they say
loves okay but loch loch nes what the
loch ness
monster it's the loch ness monster but
it's not real this is a fake or phony
picture it's a phony picture
it was a trick somebody tried to uh play
a trick on many people and said there
was a monster in the lake a horrible
creature a terrible creature and they
said it's the loch ness monster but it's
not real but a monster is a horrible
creature a terrible creature that would
be a monster
15
to get very cold
i feel cold just looking at this picture

boat this boat is not supposed to be on
snow and ice right this boat is supposed
to be in water it was in water but the
water got very cold what did the water
do
it
freeze freeze to freeze it froze freeze
froze frozen so the water around the
boat froze right when water freezes it
turns into ice
okay so to get very cold is to freeze
its freeze is also when a liquid turns
into a solid like water turning into ice
okay so that is freeze
next
not easy to do
it's not easy to climb a mountain is it
it's very difficult it takes a lot of
effort it's especially difficult when
the mountain is covered in snow and it's
very cold out so not easy to do

walk up the stairs okay it the situation
not you okay
it is hard to climb the mountain it is
difficult to climb
the mountain
okay so something's difficult it is hard
to do it
let's go over the exercises here in the
exercises we should complete each
sentence with a word from the box these
are the sentences these are our words
let's review the words before we begin
first we have
horror
horror
next
costume
costume
next is
phony
phony
next we have realistic
realistic
next is frightened
frightened
next is life like
life like
and
distinguish
distinguish
finally we have
creative
creative okay those are the words in the
box let's see where they go in the
sentences number one
the bad boys
right don't you say nothing you just say
nalady right he said naladi right bad
boys okay the bad boys made beep phone
calls to the fire station all those bad
boys
they were making
phone calls to the fire station that
were not real they weren't true that's
terrible don't do that okay the bad boys
made what's not real what word means not
real or
fake
phony
the bad boys made phony phone calls to
the fire station this is really bad
don't ever do that
don't ever make a phony phone call to
the fire station or the police it could
be very dangerous it's very bad to do
the normal
boys
i think you say naladi right very bad
boys very bad boys they shouldn't do
that
number two
an expert can beep real pearls from
imitations so an expert
this is kind of similar to phony right
think about real pearls from imitations
imitations would be phony pearls
now
what is a pearl
a pearl is a precious
it's like a stone you find it in an
oyster or a clam it's a round white and
sometimes very beautiful if you get a
good pearl very beautiful i like stone
and people will use it in jewelry
especially necklaces now of course an
expert can tell
because some people tried to copy the
real pearl from nature right but an
expert can
tell the difference
what's another word for tell the
difference another word that we talked
about here is
distinguish
distinguish so an expert can distinguish
real pearls from limitations it means an
expert can
tell the difference between a real pearl
and a phony pearl an imitation a fake
pearl okay and of course you have to be
careful there's people out there who try
to cheat they'll make phony money
they'll make phony pearls they'll make
phony
gems
diamonds and things like that but how do
you know usually experts can look at
them and they know because they're
experts they know a lot about their
subject
okay next one number three i don't
believe that you can fly i don't believe
that you can fly who can fly i don't
believe anybody can fly please be more
what so in this situation
one person is telling this person that
oh hey i can fly
you can fly i don't believe you can fly
please be more what
please be more realistic
don't be silly don't you know make up
things don't make phony beliefs or phony
statements be realistic in other words
uh something that is real or true to
life
okay four this fake flower is really
what it's interesting a lot of these
sentences are using fake phony imitation
a lot of the subjects a lot of these
words have to do with that idea
so this fake flower not a real flower
but a fake flower is really what
is really
life like it's fake but it looks
lifelike it looks like it's real it's
life like
okay
next one five the old woman likes to
wear a traditional beep all the time
now here we have traditional and here we
have where what can you wear here the
only thing you can wear is a costume but
here we have traditional now the example
i used for costume and we saw was uh of
the little boy in a bed sheet he looked
like a ghost right and of course it's
costume
but in this case it's a traditional
costume
costume isn't always you know about uh
for halloween people don't just wear
costumes on halloween when they want to
look like a ghost or a monster or famous
person
sometimes costume also means the
traditional clothes
of a people or a culture right if you
think about it what is the traditional
costume for koreans
hanbok right it's what koreans would
have worn a long time ago 100 years ago
you could also say that is a costume in
germany they would wear lederhosen right
it's a traditional german dress
for germany every country has different
traditional costumes there's special
clothes that people wear for special
occasions
okay
so they can be costumes also number six
she was beep to see a stranger
in the dark alley she was what if you
see a stranger
somebody you don't know
in a dark alley it's dark this could be
surprising you could be a little musa
while you could be a little what you
could be a little frightened she was
frightened to see a stranger in the dark
alley she was frightened
by the way it's funny just a little
story about korean uh i remember muso
musawa musa because you know the big suv
the muso i think oh muso wa so i am
afraid
okay so long hey i'm sorry but that's
just funny is sometimes you use these
little tricks to remember words okay so

i'm sorry okay next one okay number
seven
a good writer has a great beep talent
a good writer what do writers do writers
have to think of new ideas they have to
make new stories right so somebody who
can make new ideas or think of new ideas
and make new things we call those people
creative a writer good writer has a
great creative talent a creative talent
they can make or think of new things
eight i was filled with beep at the
sight of the dead body
if you saw a dead body how would you
feel
now
you would feel frightened but you're not
filled with frightened you're filled
with horror i was filled with horror at
the sight of the dead body so maybe
you're frightened by
a dead body but you are filled with
some with horror at the site so that's
kind of a special construction for using
horror you were filled with horror at
the sight of something that's a common
uh
collocation it's a common expression
common usage
okay so those are our words some good
words and some good sentences to learn
those again like i said we can see a lot
of them are about you know
distinguishing between something that's
phony and something that's real a lot of
these and of course that's what the
reading passage will be about and we're
going to go over that in just a second
so don't go away
[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary i'm brian stewart we're
looking at our unit title here imaginary
characters and as you know there are so
many different imaginary characters in
story books and movies i'm sure you have
some of your favorite imaginary
characters don't you
if you think about your favorite stories
or your favorite movies who are your
favorite imaginary characters we can
really get excited about them can't we
well in this lesson we're going to learn
about an imaginary character his name is
paul bunyan and it's called mighty
mighty paul bunyan because mighty means
strong we'll look at that in the
vocabulary in this lesson we're going to
learn about mighty paul bunyan he's an
imaginary character we can see him here
whoa he's really tall isn't he
paul bunyan was thought to be a giant
right now people think you know is there
a real person
sometimes stories are based on a real
person and people were thinking was
there a real person named paul bunyan
we're not sure this
story he's a character in a folk tale a
folk
tale
folk tales are stories that people tell
each other from a long time ago
and sometimes folk tales
might have
a true story as the beginning we but we
don't know because nobody wrote it down
they just told each other for many many
years and sometimes the story grows and
gets bigger and the characters
change a little bit maybe there was a
really big uh
character a long time ago who was like
paul bunyan but nowadays when we think
about paul bunyan we think about a giant
right he's many meters tall right and he
has an ax here this is an ax
and what does he do he cuts down trees
his folk tale the folk tales about paul
bunyan were a long time ago in america
when many men went into the forest and
cut down trees for wood because
the nation america needed wood to build
houses and to build many things so there
were many
people like him
in the world and so these stories
started but who's that what is this this
is a big blue cow
well actually it's not a cow it's an ox
it's a
babe
whoops
babe his name was babe
the
blue
babe the blue ox and we'll learn about
his character later but babe the blue ox
and paul bunyan they were partners right
they were friends okay and babe the blue
ox was a big uh kind of like a cow an ox
is like a cow but it's a very big and
strong cow with big horns as you can see
so these are the characters we're going
to learn about today in this lesson but
first let's start with the vocabulary
words first of all we have this person
he looks familiar he kind of looks like
paul bunyan
but this word is a person who cuts down
trees
this describes paul bunyan's job what
was paul bunyan's job what was he he was
a whoa it's a big word a lumberjack
lumber
jack
now you may know the word lumber lumber
is wood wood from trees is lumber jack
maybe just the name of a person
lumberjack is a person who cuts down
trees
paul bunyan was a lumberjack
okay
next one a small fire at a camp
do you ever go camping with your friends
or your family sometimes maybe your
family takes you to soraksan or waraksan
or chirisan
there's many mountains in korea you can
go camping at night sometimes the family
will sit around this it's a small fire
at a camp it's actually a
camp fire camp fire see we use these two
words together and it's called campfire
so you build a little fire at your camp
and many people will tell stories around
the campfire and so we can think of many
imaginary characters like paul bunyan
people are telling stories around the
camp fire okay next one
oh okay these kids are having a fun time
they look very happy don't they they're
listening to a story another word for a
story is a tale
tale and story
right it means the same thing a story is
a tale before i taught you folk tale
right folk tale is like folk story you
could say either one
ah okay so story entail same thing
next one total a total so if everybody
gets together they are the total they
are the whole let's say these people are
working together they are a whole team
right they are the total sum of the team
if one person is missing they're not
whole they must be together to have the
team maybe an office
team in the office or
some type of
organization they are the whole team but
it's not just people right it can be a
set of toys if you have five different
toys they make the total set they are
the whole set so in that case you could
say the whole set of
toys
the whole set of food the whole set of
whatever the whole they're all together
okay the next picture wow this is a very
beautiful picture of nature right don't
you want to go there this is a place
without people there's nobody in this
place
it's
nobody lives there maybe people have
walked through there before but if you
look at the picture there's nobody there
and there's no sign of any human
activity this is what we call wilderness
wilderness that's a long word wilderness
wilderness now i said will der ness but
actually it comes from this word here
wild
if you think of just nature right just
nature
nature
natural is wild it's in the wild right
we we don't live in the wild we live in
villages or towns or cities
but if we go away from all of that and
there's no sign of any human activity
that's just nature it's in the wild okay
and we call places like that wilderness
there's no homes no roads no telephones
maybe you can have your cell phone maybe
you have coverage but there's nothing
there except for nature trees mountains
uh
meadows forest you know things like that
that's wilderness okay next next is an
area where fruit trees are grown this is
not wilderness right this is a farm it's
a place especially it's a an area where
fruit trees are grown we have a special
name for this kind of farm it's called
an orchard
orchard
orchard so if you wonder where do your
apples come from right where do oranges
come from where did cherries come from
right cherries mashita right
where do they come from they come from
trees and these trees are grown
in a field like this they're not just
you know random trees out in nature
farmers will plant the cherry trees or
the apple trees or the orange trees in
rows so they're all there and they're
easy to pick and that's called an
orchard right so if you want to get
fresh fruit and very cheap go to the
orchard in the fall that's when the
fruit is ready it's ripe and it's ready
to eat it's a good place to go right so
that's an orchard
okay next one ah don't you want to go
scuba diving do you want to see this
underwater a wild and exciting
experience if you go scuba diving
you will have an adventure because you
can see the coral and the fish maybe
other scuba divers looking at you
right we can see this is an adventure
adventure an adventure is an exciting
time it's so maybe a wild time wild
maybe you go into nature or wild also
means uh not controlled you don't know
what's going to happen right so it can
be an adventure because you don't know
what's going to happen and it's very
exciting what does happen that's an
adventure
okay
next one these kids are having fun right
with great happiness what do we say
joyously
joy you know the word joy
joy is happy right you say kibuni
right kibuni choi
that's joy i'm very happy
but we say joyously it means with great
happiness this describes
how
you do something or how
something is done
if you watch a tv show and you watch it
with a lot of happiness
you are watching joyously okay if you're
reading a book ah no much miso right
very good book
and you really are happy when you read
the book you read the book joyously so
this word goes with a verb read joyously
watch
joyously
play
joyously so this word goes with verbs to
describe
how
the action is done okay
next one
twisting
have you ever been on a road like this
this is a very adventurous road right
but a twisting twisting another word for
twisting is
winding
to twist right and to wind they're kind
of similar
this is wind not wind
okay spelled the same but different
pronunciation twist means to twist
something right you take a ribbon and
you twist it so it's not straight you
twist it
wind also can be uh like this you take a
string and you wind the string you can
wind the string around something else it
just means not straight
right it's winding or twisting like a
road this is a very fun road to ride
your bike on right wee you go around the
curbs but be careful there might be a
car so joshua hale but it's a very fun
road to be on right okay so twisting or
winding it's a winding road
next one oh look at that that's crazy
one eye big nose one tooth and a foot
what kind of crazy thing is that it's
unreal or fictional it's not real right
so we can say it's
imaginary you guys imaginary
[Music]
right big word i me
wow five sounds all together in one word
imaginary if we think about it you can
see this word imagine and if we put an e
right imagine means to think
of something not real but to have an
idea of something different if you can
imagine yourself
in a different world sometimes when you
read books you can imagine yourself like
in a spaceship or on another planet or
fighting dragons with the sword right
this is what we imagine it's all
imaginary
those things so it's not real it's
fictional i've never seen a character
like this right it's not real it's
imaginary just in people's minds in your
imagination you can also say
oops slow

right now this is an extreme example
usually you hold your shoe together with
rope don't tie people up with rope right
but what this is is tie i just use that
word tai tai
is a verb to hold something together
with the rope so if they these two
people are tied together
they're tied together now normally we
tie things in our life
if you have a shoe with shoe laces you
tie the shoelaces together
that's very common
many people do that every day so that
just to hold something with a rope you
tie it also if you have many things you
want to carry from one place to another
you could put packages or your backpack
you could tie it to the back of your
bicycle and it doesn't fall off when you
ride to school so you could tie many
things with rope
okay next one whoa looks like a strong
person there do you
lift weights

mighty we saw this word before on the
title
mighty paul bunyan so it means that paul
bunyan the imaginary character is very
strong and he's really powerful he can
do many things with his body because
he's really strong he's very powerful
okay
next one to move something from side to
side very fast so if something's moving
like this if you take something in your
hand and you move it like this or up and
down you know around
let's say you want to mix something
right so you have ice and lemonade and
you mix it like this
what are you doing you are shaking to
shake you can also just shake your body
like this right if you're cold people
shake okay stop shaking
okay stop shaking so shake is to shake
also very common what else do we shake
we shake hands right when we meet
another person we shake their hands
that's what western people do especially
in america right in korea we usually bow
but in america they usually shake the
hands of the person and that's like
saying hello how are you
sheikh is an irregular verb so we use it
it changes form in the past okay so we
say sheikh
shook shaken
okay
shake shook
shaken that's how we use this word in
the past it's an irregular verb okay
next one
here is
another
picture of a it looks like a cow right
but it looks like a little bit of a
strange cow it's not a normal cow look
at this it's a bull used for farm work
right so it's a bull a bull means namja
right not yoja namja so it's a namja cow
okay but it's used for farm work and
look it's got these big horns whoa okay
it's got a big hump on its back and it
looks very strong right there's a
special word we use for that it's ox
aha remember paul bunyan's friend i told
you about before was a big blue ox okay
so that's an imaginary character but
it's based on this type of animal a bull
of a namja a male cow used for working
on the farm they you know you can tie
something to the ox and it will pull
something usually farmers use the auxes
to help them plow the field
plow
the
field and what they do
is they put a big blade like a big piece
of iron and the ox drags it on the
ground and it digs a line and the
farmers can plant their uh plants in
that line so oxes are used to plow the
field that's called to plow the field
and so oxes and horses are used to do
that
okay but oxes are very strong and they
may be stronger than horses sometimes
okay
15.
oh no it's terrible right mogi
right a mosquito came and bit her on the
arm we can see that we all know that
right oh i hate that mogi shiraiyo right
i really hate the mosquitoes a feeling
on your skin that you want to scratch so
if a mosquito came and bit you right
you have a feeling you want to scratch
it what is that feeling we say it's an
itch right i have an itch i
excuse me i have
an
itch
i have an itch on my arm
when i wear shorts
[Music]
right and at night time if i'm in the
forest all the mosquitoes really bite my
ankles ah i hate it i have an itch
on my ankles on my foot oh no mo shirai
all right so i have an itch i have an
itch you can also say my
foot
itches whoops
it
chis so
itch can be a noun it can also be used
as a verb it itches my foot itches oh my
hand itches
uh it itches
like i have a bite i just say it itches
so it can be a noun i have an itch or
verb it itches okay what do you do you
scratch
scratch and itch don't say i itch my arm
no that's crazy you don't itch your arm
your arm itches so you scratch it okay
but be careful don't scratch it too much
because that's not good if your hand is
dirty and you scratch it too hard you
might break the skin and then it can get
infected so be careful right don't
scratch too much i know it's terrible it
drives you crazy i hate itching right
but
maybe put some cream on it or some
medicine okay okay next one

fall so before we talked about
lumberjacks right that was our first
word a lumberjacks usually use an axe
and they chop down

axe before on the first picture when i
was talking about paul bunyan i looked
at his axe and i spelled it that way ax

a 10 letter word right wilderness is a
10 letter word
that means you know it's a difficult

the wilderness
okay let's go over the words for going
down now
number two he went to africa for and
what
if you go to africa right it's a
different place
uh different people different style of
architecture
many wild animals very beautiful scenery
right so what will you have you'll have
a wild and exciting time won't you what
means wild and excitable time
probably this word here adventure he
went to africa for an adventure so many
people
travel to another place
for an adventure okay so you might go to
uh
south america for an adventure
if you really want a a very amazing
adventure maybe you go to the north pole
or south pole and of course you can go
to africa for an adventure too in fact
almost anywhere you go
if it's wild and exciting it could be an
adventure okay the next word still going
down number three a b
long word
is cutting down a tree but in this
sentence we're looking for the subject
right the subject how do we know because
here's the verb so a someone or
something is doing this what are they
doing
cutting down a tree now remember in the
vocabulary section it was our first word
we talked about a person who cuts down a
tree so we're looking for the person
it's a job title
of a person whose job it is to cut down
trees
which word means a person whose job it
is to cut down trees of course it's over
here lumberjack
really long word a lumberjack is cutting
down a tree so lumberjack it's like the
song maybe you don't know it it's a long
time ago it goes i'm a lumberjack and
i'm okay
i cut chop down trees i eat my lunch and
i go to the lava tree
okay so it's kind of an it's an old song
it's kind of a funny song by a british
group called monty python
look them up but lumberjack what does he
do i'm a lumberjack and i'm okay
i cut down trees i eat my lunch and i go
to the lavatory
lavatory what's lavatory i have to teach
you that because it's in the song a
lavatory and sometimes people say lavora
lavatory but in the song it's it's you
can also pronounce it lavatory lavatory
is another word for bathroom and english
is crazy we have so many words for
bathroom bathroom of course is hua jiung
shil right so you can say where is the
bathroom
where is the
bathroom sometimes people call it the
rest room where is the rest room
some people even say where is the i'll
put it up here where is the toilet
but that's not so polite it's more
polite to say bathroom restroom or
lavatory
or lavatory right
restroom bathroom lavatory toilet okay
also one more wc but that's a little
old-fashioned wc what is wc wc is
water
closet because a long
time ago
when the toilet
was first invented it was put into
people's houses
they didn't know what to call it it's
like a small room in the house that's a
closet but it had water in it you know a
long time ago before when people didn't
have they weren't used to having water
in the house plumbing was new so they
called it a water closet some people in
some countries still call it water
closet but it's a little old-fashioned
americans usually say bathroom or
restroom lavatory or lavatory water
closet more common in england or britain
okay
americans will normally say bathroom or
restroom anyway that's a very long
explanation
we came from lumberjack from the song
i'm a lumberjack and i'm okay i chop
down trees i eat my lunch and i go to
the lavatory
okay so that's kind of funny anyway
that's lumberjack next one
down four down we sat around the what
you sit around what would you sit around
especially when you're with your family
you're out in the woods you're having a
good time

around that fire what do we call that

going down number five we sang together
beep
okay kind of a long word one two three
four five six seven eight we're looking

00:20
talking about a lot of different
00:23
subjects we'll talk about science so
00:26
some lessons will be about science
00:29
some lessons will be about social
00:31
studies
00:33
some lessons will be about health so
00:35
those are important right of course
00:37

00:46
math
00:47
well math is interesting we can take a
00:49
look at some lessons about math and a
00:52
new subject
00:53
entertainment so that will be
00:55
interesting too also something new with
00:58
level c is that some lessons will have

01:08
lesson number one
01:09
you bet let's get going okay number one
01:13
lesson one we're talking about animals
01:16
and our subject of course is science
01:19
right especially biology
01:21
the study of life
01:23
so animals we're going to be looking at
01:26
the the name of the unit is in a land
01:29
before time actually the name of the
01:31
lesson in a land before time what does
01:35
that mean
01:36
well think about it be when was time
01:40
thought of right human beings invented
01:43
time so this is like before humans a
01:47
long time ago the earth is millions and
01:49
millions and millions of years old
01:53
humans haven't always been on the earth
01:56
so what was the earth like
01:58
what kind of animals lived on the earth
02:01
before human beings so in this lesson we
02:05
can learn about
02:06
dinosaurs
02:08
from their bones because dinosaurs lived
02:11
on the earth a long long long
02:15
long
02:16
long time before human beings came about
02:21
okay let's take a look here we have a
02:24
video for you what exactly is a dinosaur
02:27
you probably know what a dinosaur is
02:29
right there's many uh television shows
02:32
animation uh shows and movies about
02:36
dinosaurs right you've probably seen
02:39
some of those of course a dinosaur is
02:41
like a big terrible lizard right it
02:44
looks like
02:45
like this oh my gosh look at that that's
02:48
kind of oh my gosh
02:50
look at that that's a huge dinosaur
02:52
that's kind of scary isn't it
02:59
is he gone
03:00
oh he's still there
03:01
okay he's gone we got rid of the
03:03
dinosaur okay
03:05
dinosaurs were really really scary we're
03:08
very very lucky that there are no more
03:11
dinosaurs because they're huge some
03:13
dinosaurs were huge we'll learn more
03:15
about dinosaurs in this lesson okay but
03:19
as we get started of course we need to
03:21
learn some vocabulary let's take a look
03:24
the first vocabulary word the definition
03:28
a hot
03:29
hot place
03:30
with a lot of plants so if you think of
03:33
a hot place there are many plants there
03:36
what do we call that type of environment
03:39
we say it is a jungle a jungle and you
03:43
can think if you go south or if you go
03:46
to southeast asia if you go to vietnam
03:49
thailand the philippines those are very
03:52
hot places there are many plants there
03:55
it's they have many jungles in those
03:58
places a hot place with a lot of plants
04:01
jungle okay next one
04:04
oh this is the opposite of a jungle
04:06
right it's very cold there's a lot of
04:08
snow on the ground but look at what
04:10
happens when somebody walks across the
04:14
snow they're making marks so this word
04:18
is a mark made by a foot right when a
04:22
person or an animal is walking in the
04:25
snow
04:26
in the sand
04:28
in the mud what do they leave behind
04:31
them they leave behind them a foot print
04:36
foot print footprint
04:39
this person is leaving many footprints
04:42
behind them remember footprint is
04:45
singular hana right if you say footprint
04:48
you mean hanuman if you say footprints
04:51
you mean
04:52
manio right many so
04:55
be careful sometimes students will make
04:57
that mistake
04:59
footprint is only one but you can't
05:01
leave just one footprint
05:04
unless you're jumping really far right
05:07
so you leave footprints behind you
05:10
next one oh what's this this looks very
05:14
old doesn't it this
05:16
of course is the bone around your brain
05:19
this is a person's head someone who died
05:22
a long time ago
05:24
the only thing that's left is the bone
05:27
bones last for a long time
05:30
skin hair organs those things dissolve
05:35
and they go away after somebody dies but
05:38
the bone stays for a long time so the
05:42
bone around your brain what do we call
05:44
this bone we call this bone a skull
05:48
now that's a little hard to pronounce
05:50
right s k and ll at the end sk
05:56
sk
05:58
and ll just oh so and we have the u
06:02
skull
06:04
skull so we say that word as skull now a
06:08
lot of times when we see the skull we
06:10
think of death right that's a symbol for
06:13
death you guys know pirates right the
06:16
pirate flag is a skull
06:20
and
06:21
crossbones
06:24
what that means is they take two bones
06:27
and they cross them right now i'm not a
06:29
very good artist but i'll try to make a
06:32
skull now i'll just make the crossbones
06:34
i can't really draw a skull am i doing
06:36
okay yeah i seem to be doing all okay
06:38
it's kind of like a bone here right so
06:41
the crossbones so they'll have a flag
06:43
and they'll have a skull on the top and
06:45
they'll have crossbones skull and
06:47
crossbones is a very common flag for
06:51
pirates if you see a pirate ship they
06:53
have a black flag and a white skull and
06:57
crossbones on it so skull is usually
06:59
associated with death because pirates
07:02
are bad guys right okay
07:05
four
07:06
the weather conditions in a certain
07:08
place
07:09
so if you're talking about the weather
07:11
conditions it's hot and sunny or it's
07:14
cold and snowy how do we one word how do
07:18
we describe those conditions with one
07:21
word we say what is the climate like
07:26
what
07:27
is
07:29
the oops the
07:32
climate
07:34
what is the climate
07:36
like
07:38
right
07:40
it's very common if you're talking to a
07:42
friend you make a friend on the internet
07:45
or with email through your school a
07:47
program and you meet a friend in africa
07:50
and you want to exchange emails with
07:52
that friend or you meet a friend in
07:55
finland and you can ask them what is the
07:58
climate like in your country the person
08:01
in africa will probably say hot and
08:04
humid the person in finland will
08:07
probably say cold and snowy so what are
08:10
the weather conditions
08:12
in a certain place
08:14
okay
08:15
number five
08:17
to continue to live if something
08:20
continues to live they
08:22
endure they
08:24
survive right i can't i can't say it
08:27
without saying the word right survive
08:29
that's a little difficult word to say
08:32
remember sir vive it's two sounds one
08:35
two
08:36
sir
08:37
vive
08:39
survive so when you put them together
08:42
survive one more time
08:44
survive so survive means to continue to
08:48
live not
08:49
die
08:50
so if something doesn't die it continues
08:53
to live and this is for individuals but
08:56
it's also for groups too right of course
08:59
individuals die all the time but groups
09:03
of animals might survive for a very long
09:06
time okay
09:09
six
09:10
interesting and special
09:13
very interesting very special city very
09:16
beautiful city right what do we say it's
09:19
remarkable now this is a long word right
09:23
re
09:24
mar
09:26
ca bull if you're going to split it up
09:28
into sounds you got one two three four
09:31
so four syllables re marco
09:36
remarkable and you know you remark you
09:38
could probably put it there to remark uh
09:41
you don't have to say mar remar kabul
09:43
but you know it depends on how you
09:45
pronounce it so
09:46
you can say if you put them all together
09:48
it sounds remarkable
09:51
remarkable okay one more time remarkable
09:55
remarkable interesting and special okay
09:59
let's move on to number seven
10:02
to keep from being ruined of course if
10:04
you leave food open to the air
10:08
it will begin to smell it will go bad
10:10
but you want to keep it from being
10:13
ruined you want to
10:15
keep it in its original state are close
10:18
to its original state what do you do you
10:21
preserve it
10:24
preserve so again we have two
10:27
sounds preserved now this looks like
10:30
serve but don't say pre-serve say
10:33
preserve
10:34
preserve okay and that is a
10:38
verb to keep something from being ruined
10:42
to preserve something so you are going
10:45
to keep it
10:46
in the original state so it doesn't get
10:49
old if you want to keep food for a long
10:52
time you put it in a can you preserve it
10:55
so you can eat it two months later
10:59
four months later maybe even a year
11:01
later but even food in a can you can't
11:05
keep it forever right you gotta eat it
11:07
sometime because it will get ruined
11:09
after a certain amount of time but you
11:11
can preserve it for a long time in a can
11:16
eight well it's a strange looking animal
11:18
right what animal is this do you know
11:20
maybe you learn from history or from
11:23
lessons in school what's wrong with this
11:25
pen uh oh here we go dodo
11:28
it's a dodo bird have you heard of the
11:30
dodo bird before the dodo bird uh
11:34
well that's weird the dodo bird went
11:38
extinct
11:39
and that's our word extinct so when
11:41
people think of the word extinct
11:44
it's very common to think of the dodo
11:46
bird it's a very famous bird
11:49
that died when human beings came to the
11:52
island where it lived extinct means no
11:56
longer in existence the human beings
11:58
killed all the dodo birds and they
12:01
brought dogs with them the dogs also
12:03
hunted the birds so in a very short time
12:07
all the dodo birds went extinct so we
12:11
can use the word
12:12
go as past tense right to go
12:16
go extinct the dodo bird went extinct
12:20
past tense okay
12:22
no longer in existence is extinct and
12:25
many animals have become extinct
12:28
over the history of the earth the
12:30
earth's history is very very very very
12:33
long and many animals have gone extinct
12:35
many types of animals
12:38
nine
12:39
sometimes of course animals will leave
12:42
evidence that they existed and that
12:45
evidence is their remains the remains
12:48
what is left behind the remains of an
12:52
animal or plant so it's an animal or a
12:54
plant not just animal but also plants
12:58
leave remains and you can find them in
13:01
the rocks usually the animal or plant
13:04
dies in mud and the mud is compressed
13:07
under pressure and that mud becomes rock
13:10
well the imprint the imprint of the
13:13
animal's body or the plant's body is
13:17
left or made into the rock and these are
13:19
very neat if you find them what am i
13:22
talking about i'm talking about fossils
13:25
it's very cool very neat if you find a
13:28
fossil in the rock so next time you're
13:31
in the country next time you're in
13:34
walking through the
13:35
mountains or walking through a field and
13:37
you see some interesting rocks take a
13:39
look at them see if you can find any
13:42
fossils who knows maybe you'll find an
13:44
interesting fossil
13:46
okay next word
13:48
this one is to be present in a place
13:51
this is a picture it looks like mars of
13:54
course many scientists uh have been uh
13:58
wondering if water
14:01
exists
14:02
on mars so if water is present in a
14:06
place like water is on mars then water
14:10
exists
14:11
on mars and of course we now know that
14:14
at the north pole and the south pole you
14:17
can't see it because the
14:19
mars is tilted like this you can't see
14:20
the south pole but at the north pole
14:22
there's frozen water ice right so there
14:26
is water water does exist on mars okay
14:32
number 11 a small plant with many
14:36
branches so these are very common we see
14:39
these around buildings and in parks
14:42
people like to grow them because they
14:44
form like a small wall so you know
14:47
people
14:48
don't go over that of course we call it
14:51
a bush
14:53
a bush now of course these are little
14:55
bushes a lot of bushes in a line you
14:57
call a hedge
14:59
a hedge
15:00
right and this is like a hedge it's a
15:03
line of bushes that people will make in
15:06
a park or near a building to you know
15:08
like a little small little wall but
15:10
there's as many bushes a small plant
15:12
with many branches we call it a bush
15:16
not a tree right we can say there's like
15:18
two main types of plants we can see
15:21
easily one is a tree of course a tree
15:24
grows
15:25
very big i got a mushroom cloud here
15:27
okay
15:28
okay that's a tree and then of course
15:30
you have a little
15:31
little bush
15:33
right so a bush and a tree right so uh
15:37
we talk about bushes and we talk about
15:38
trees those are the two main types of
15:41
plants of course you have other types
15:43
but usually we see
15:45
trees and bushes
15:47
number 12
15:49
a climbing plant this is another type of
15:51
plant a climbing plant what does it mean
15:54
a plant that climbs
15:56
yes because these
15:58
branches or long thin stems right you
16:02
can say a branch is like a tree branch
16:04
it's very thick and very strong but some
16:07
plants are very they have arms or
16:09
branches that are very small and they're
16:11
very they're not strong you can bend
16:14
them and we call those stems okay so
16:17
long thin stems and this is a plant with
16:19
long thin stems that grow and climb up
16:23
walls so it's a climbing plant we call
16:26
it a vine
16:28
so on some very old buildings especially
16:30
old brick buildings you can see that
16:33
they're covered with a green plant
16:36
because the plant it's called a vine has
16:38
grown up and they hook
16:40
they've got little hooks on the stems
16:42
and they hook onto the wall and they
16:44
climb up the wall very nice looking very
16:47
neat
16:48
13 to wind together so if you take some
16:52
dead branches
16:54
some stems and you wind them together
16:57
like this what are you doing it's a verb
17:00
to twist
17:02
to wind together you can wind plants
17:05
together you can wind your i'm too old i
17:08
can't do it you can wind your arms
17:10
together right you can wind rope
17:13
together you can wind or you can twist
17:16
many things so you can twist your arms
17:19
you can twist rope you can twist your
17:22
hair
17:22
you can twist something together or to
17:25
wind together
17:28
fourteen oh he's having a lot of fun
17:30

17:32
fun like that well you can but don't
17:34
tell your mom i told you to go out and
17:36
play in the mud okay
17:38
wet dirt of course i just said it it's
17:41
mud
17:41
and sometimes in korea i forgot where it
17:43
was i'm not sure the name i'm a little
17:46
worried if i mispronounce it it's boring
17:48
boring
17:50
mud festival is that right yeah in korea
17:53
you have a mud festival at boryang
17:56
boringshi or a bordeaux place i'm not
17:58
sure but um many people will go there
18:01
and they'll play in the mud right during
18:03
the summer it's a nice thing to do it's
18:05
cool and it's wet so people you know
18:08
it's kind of like water playing in the
18:09
water so it's mud
18:11
and people will plant it people will
18:14
throw it at each other of course
18:15
normally don't step in it because if
18:18
you're wearing nice clothes your mother
18:20
will get angry if you get mud on your
18:22
clothes okay
18:25
next word an animal that lived long ago
18:28
but is now extinct ah that's one of the
18:31
words we learned before extinct it
18:33
doesn't exist anymore it's gone it did
18:38
not survive and of course we saw this
18:40
animal before right the video that i was
18:42
scared of before that's a scary animal
18:44
right of course it is a dinosaur it's an
18:48
animal that lived long ago but is now
18:50
extinct it doesn't exist anymore
18:54
because if it did
18:56
we would be in big danger right there
18:59
would be too many of them dinosaur
19:01
dinosaur three were three sounds
19:04
dinosaur
19:06
it looks like dinosaur but we say
19:08

19:10
okay some people can say dinosaur but
19:13
most common it's dinosaur dinosaur
19:17
okay
19:18
another word here a place where you can
19:21
see many important things so if you want
19:24
to learn about things
19:26
that existed
19:28
a long long time ago or things that you
19:32
know exist now but usually they're from
19:34
history and people will take them and
19:36
display them in certain buildings what
19:39
is that building called it's called a
19:41
museum museum
19:45
museum
19:47
a place where you can see many important
19:49
things so here we see uh things from
19:52
ancient
19:53
excuse me ancient egypt right a long
19:56
time ago we can see the mummies right
19:58
and you can see mummies in a museum you
20:01
can see things from your country that
20:04
existed a long time ago in a museum
20:07
in natural museums natural history
20:10
museums we can see animals that existed
20:13
a long time ago in natural history
20:16
museums okay
20:19
let's go over exercise here the first
20:21
exercise has to do with
20:24
antonyms
20:25
antonym what is an antonym antonym means
20:30
oh let's draw that line here a little
20:32
bit more slowly antonym means words that
20:36
have opposite
20:38
opposite
20:41
opposite meaning it's like pandero right
20:44
pandiro opposite meaning antonym so our
20:48
instruction our direction is match the
20:52
words in the box
20:54
here with their antonyms listed below so
20:59
these words are the opposite of these
21:03
words that's what we have to do we have
21:04
to match the opposites okay
21:07
the words are
21:08
preserved
21:10
right we learned the word preserve we
21:12
learned that it was a verb
21:14
so now it's used
21:17
with an ed so it's past tense like
21:20
preserved they have been preserved
21:23
next one jungle
21:26
jungle next one survive survive
21:30
and last one
21:31
extinct
21:33
extinct
21:34
okay what are the opposites of these
21:37
words number one is alive what is the
21:40
opposite meaning of alive
21:43
something that is not alive anymore it's
21:46
dead and maybe all of them are dead then
21:48
we can say
21:49
extinct if they're extinct they're dead
21:52
they're gone no more but if they're
21:54
alive they continue to exist okay
21:59
next one
22:00
desert
22:01
what is a desert a desert is a hot place
22:05
but it has no plants
22:08
no plants grow in a desert it's just
22:10
dirt or just sand there's no plants so
22:14
what's the opposite
22:16
of
22:17
a desert we could say it's a jungle
22:20
because a jungle has many many plants
22:23
there's a lot of water in the jungle
22:26
there is no water in the desert or very
22:29
little water in the desert
22:31
three
22:32
die
22:33
so that's a sad word right die so what's
22:36
the opposite of die if something dies
22:39
right it doesn't what it doesn't survive
22:42
any longer it's not alive right by the
22:45
way dying alive those are also antonyms
22:48
aren't they
22:49
die and survive are also antonyms okay
22:53
the last one here ruined if something is
22:57
ruined it's been spoiled it has changed
23:00
from its original condition but if you
23:03
keep something in the original condition
23:05
it doesn't change you have preserved it
23:10
it's not ruined it is preserved it's not
23:13
ruined it's preserved okay so those are
23:16
the antonyms the opposite meaning of
23:19
these words
23:21
now our next exercise is talking about
23:24
synonyms right before we talked about
23:27
antonyms now we're going to talk about
23:30
synonyms what does synonyms mean synonym
23:34
is same
23:37
the same meaning so a cinnamon is a word
23:40
or two words that have the same or
23:43
similar pistandeo right maybe not
23:48
okay so maybe not exactly the same but
23:50
similar meanings okay
23:52
same meanings match the words in the box
23:55
with their synonyms listed below so
23:59
these words in the box we need to match
24:02
them with the word that has the same or
24:06
similar
24:07
meaning
24:08
similar
24:09
so same or similar meaning okay let's
24:13
look at the words in the box first we
24:16
have
24:16

24:19
next word
24:20

24:22
footprints
24:24
the next word is remarkable
24:27

24:35
the box to the same or similar meanings
24:38
of these words here the first word is
24:40
amazing amazing it's really amazing it
24:45
amazes you it impresses you it's really
24:49
exceptional
24:50
what do we say is a similar meaning we
24:53

24:55
remarkable is similar to amazing if you
24:59
think wow that's amazing it is
25:02
remarkable okay the similar meaning
25:05
number two is head okay so head
25:09
not the same meaning but similar meaning
25:12
for head what's in your head right what
25:14
is that bone there we could say it's the
25:16
skull so skull isn't the same as head
25:20

25:23
are similar
25:25
three
25:26
weather so we're talking about the

weather in a certain place especially
25:31

25:42

31:47
little eye is looking at the boy but
31:49
pecop in english we say belly
31:54
button
31:56
so we use that word belly belly belly is
31:59
kind of a casual word uh you know kids
32:02
use it belly uh stomach is more of a
32:06
formal word doctors will use stomach
32:09
parents will use stomach but you know if
32:11
you're speaking casually with your

32:21
everybody has a belly button you have a

belly button that's what we call it
32:24
there
32:25
belly when we use it in the plural we
32:28
change y to i
32:30
and e s at the end belize right so if
32:35
many people you're talking about many
32:37
people they have many bellies okay belly
32:41
okay
32:43
a small stick if we're looking at a
32:45
small stick a very small stick maybe
32:47
this long maybe this long it's very thin
32:50
we can say that it is a twig a twig is
32:53
another word for a small stick english
32:56
is very descriptive isn't it we have a
32:58
lot of specific words for very uh unique
33:03
or very special types of things stick is
33:06
like an umbrella word you know you have
33:08
long sticks short sticks you know thick
33:10
sticks thin sticks but a twig is a
33:13
special kind of stick it means short and
33:16
thin it's a twig you can hold it easily
33:21
what is this guy doing is he crazy okay
33:24
what is he yelling at his golf club
33:28
a feeling he has strong emotions
33:32
maybe he's very upset because he hit the
33:34
ball and it went the wrong way so
33:37
instead of thinking oh i made a mistake
33:40
he blames his golf club he's very has a
33:43
very strong emotion towards his golf
33:46
club but remember emotions aren't just
33:49
negative emotions can be positive too
33:53
happiness is an emotion if you're really
33:56
really happy that's an emotion if you're
33:59
really really sad that's also an emotion
34:03
there are many kinds of emotions
34:05
emotions can be positive
34:09
and they can be negative
34:12
so emotion isn't a positive or negative
34:15
word it just means all of those emotions
34:18
it's like an umbrella word for that okay

oh look at this chimp he's dancing right

50:07
course it depends on what you're talking
50:09
about what's after seven oh dinner time
50:11
no we're talking about math counting so
50:14
what's after seven it's eight okay so
50:16
that's we're going to learn about in
50:18
this lesson something very interesting
50:20
about an animal an elephant that can
50:23
count that's very strange right well
50:26
let's get right away let's go into the
50:28
vocabulary that we need to know these
50:31
words in order to study the reading
50:34
passage later on
50:35
now the first word we have is
50:38
to find something
50:40
to find something now that's an
50:42
interesting picture looks like a scuba
50:43
diver just came up and he found
50:46
something on the bottom of the ocean
50:48
what did he do he discovered something
50:52
he discovered something by the way
50:54
doesn't he look familiar yeah he's a
50:57
famous actor matthew mcconaughey okay
51:00
maybe you've seen him in a movie before
51:02
but in this movie he discovered
51:04
something at the bottom of the ocean so
51:07
when you find something you discover it
51:10
okay next word
51:12
well we have many apples here many green
51:15
apples there's one red apple to change
51:18
one thing for another so let's say this
51:21
person says okay i'm going to take the
51:23
the red apple and i'm going to put a
51:26
green apple in its place
51:28
in this case you could say switch
51:31
they're going to switch apples right so
51:34
they switch this red apple they take it
51:37
out and they put a green one in its
51:38
place that means you switched them to
51:42
switch
51:43
okay number three
51:45
oh person is doing exercise can you do
51:47
this exercise
51:49
uh it's called a push-up by the way
51:51
that's not the word but just so you know
51:54
this is called a push-up push-up she's
51:56
doing push-ups right you could do
51:59
sit-ups right this is a push-up but when
52:03
you do push-ups you don't just do one
52:06
right you do them again you
52:09
basically you repeat the exercise right
52:12
so you say i can do push-ups one i'm
52:15
done no you have to repeat right do it
52:18
ten times right do one push-up two
52:21
push-ups three push-ups you repeat you
52:24
do again so when you exercise you do the
52:28
exercise again you repeat the exercise
52:31
many times
52:34
number four very smart girl right she's
52:36
going to be a chemist when she grows up
52:38
she's studying chemistry
52:41
now chemist by the way how do you say
52:43
that chemist
52:45
chemist a chemist is a type of scientist
52:48
what do scientists do
52:51
they have tests to see what happens
52:54
scientists have many questions about the
52:56
world so they have many tests to see
53:00
what will happen if they do something
53:02
and we call that another word for that
53:04
test is called an oh this is a really
53:07
long word experiment
53:10
so long right experiment
53:14
so how many sounds ex
53:16
beer e meant
53:18
for sounds
53:20
ex beer uh meant let's put them all
53:23
together
53:24
experiment
53:26
experiment
53:27
so an experiment
53:29
is specifically what a scientist like a
53:32
chemist
53:33
does to see what happens it's a test a
53:36
type of test a very specific type of
53:39
test there are many kinds of tests you
53:41
take a test in school that's not an
53:44
experiment
53:45
an experiment is when a scientist
53:48
does something to see what will happen
53:50
that's an experiment okay next one
53:54
oh this is a very interesting picture
53:56
isn't it
53:57
to choose now it's important to choose
54:01
wisely right
54:02
you see this picture here this person
54:06
chose a hamburger
54:09
you see
54:10
this person chose an apple
54:14
you see
54:15
very important to choose the right thing
54:19
person who chose a hamburger is kind of
54:21
fat right
54:23
but this person who chose the apple
54:26
they're slim they're not so fat they're
54:30
in good shape okay but you choose
54:32
something another word to choose is to
54:35
select you select one thing or the other
54:39
thing will you select a hamburger
54:42
then you will look like me right
54:45
if you select the apple you'll look like
54:47
i did 20 years ago
54:49
okay so depending on what you choose
54:53
that's important depending on what you
54:54
select what will you select okay
54:58
next one
54:59
a container for holding something this
55:02
is a container there are many different
55:05
kinds of containers that hold things
55:07
right
55:08

55:11

55:14
handle that you can carry it we call
55:17
this container a bucket a bucket is
55:20
usually used to carry water
55:23

55:25
or something else and you can
55:27
many buckets have a handle
55:29
that you can carry it around with okay
55:31
buckets are good for carrying heavy
55:33
things but we call this type of
55:35
container a bucket they're made of metal
55:38
or plastic so plastic bucket metal
55:41
bucket
55:42
this one's made of metal
55:45
next one oh
55:47
what's he doing he looks familiar he's
55:49
teaching right
55:50
a university teacher but he's not just a
55:53
teacher right in your elementary school
55:56
your middle school your high school you
55:58
can call those
55:59
uh people teachers but at a university
56:02
they have a special word for that type
56:04
of teacher they call them professor
56:08
professor professor
56:10
professor that's the word for a teacher
56:13
who teaches at a university you don't
56:16
call your teacher in high school a
56:18
professor you just say teacher but when
56:21
you go to college or you go to
56:23
university then you say professor okay
56:27
next one there's a group of people here
56:29
they look very surprised to surprise
56:33
someone greatly now when you surprise
56:35
someone greatly especially it means you
56:38
scare them a little bit right that means
56:42
you shock them oh my gosh
56:45
right you say oh i am shocked right you
56:49
surprised someone really a lot to shock
56:53
them
56:54
he shocked them okay next one
56:57
now she looks a little frustrated right
56:59
something that is wrong something of
57:02
course with computers many things go
57:04
wrong right so we can say it is a
57:08
mistake okay hopefully she didn't make
57:10
the mistake maybe the computer made the
57:12
mistake but anyway something went wrong
57:15
something wrong happened it is a mistake
57:20
so it's a mistake
57:22
okay next one
57:23
to make it difficult for someone to
57:26
think clearly
57:28
this person is buried under many a lot
57:30
of work right they have so many things
57:32
to do it's difficult for them to think
57:35
clearly they are confused they don't
57:37
know what to do should i do this job
57:39
should i do this job or the phone's
57:41
ringing my boss is calling me
57:43
i'm confused right to confuse
57:47
confuse
57:49
confuse
57:50
confuse i'm very confused i don't know
57:53
what to do
57:56
eleven
57:57
well this guy's pretty smart right he's
58:00
doing what is he doing well the study of
58:02
numbers he's figuring out
58:05
uh how to
58:07
not just add and subtract but also
58:09
multiply and divide he's studying math
58:13
did you hear what i said add
58:17
subtract
58:20
that's simple math right if you add and
58:22
subtract that's simple math add is like
58:25
plus or minus but i also said multiply
58:30
multiply oops multiply
58:34
and
58:34
divide that's more difficult math right
58:38
that's multiply we usually use that
58:41
symbol and to divide we use that symbol
58:44
okay so
58:46
add subtract multiply divide this is all
58:49
the study of math and the type of math
58:51
he's doing is algebra this is algebra
58:57
there are many types of math right there
59:00
are many types of math there's simple
59:02
math doing this there's algebra there's
59:04
trigonometry there's calculus ooh
59:07
calculus is very difficult right but
59:09
algebra probably you will study algebra
59:11
maybe you're studying algebra now
59:14
oh by the way isn't this picture a
59:15
little strange think about it
59:17
he's writing but he's writing backwards
59:22
he's writing backwards so you can see
59:24
what he's writing but if you look at the
59:26
picture closely you see oh something
59:28
strange about the picture by the way
59:30
it's also interesting to notice you know
59:31
i'm just getting on to some of these b
59:34
equals 2. if you do these problems these
59:37
problems work out and if i'll just give
59:39
you the answer
59:40
a what does a equal a equals 5. look at
59:44
it later okay we're studying words now
59:46
but if you want to look at the math a
59:48
equals five do it later okay
59:51
twelve
59:52
intelligent somebody who's intelligent
59:55
okay
59:56
what do we call them we call them smart
59:58
are you smart of course you're smart
60:01
you're studying with me right i'm sorry
60:04
you're studying with these textbooks
60:06
so you will you're smart right because
60:09
you're intelligent um
60:12
if you know a lot of things it's
60:14
interesting to
60:15
look at this word intelligent and smart
60:17
intelligent doesn't mean that you have a
60:20
lot of knowledge
60:22
intelligence means that you can learn
60:26
quickly you can learn the knowledge
60:28
there's a difference between being
60:30
intelligent and being wise
60:33
if somebody is wise that means they have
60:36
a lot of experience
60:38
and they know
60:39
from life what to do but somebody who's
60:42
intelligent has the ability intelligent
60:45
is like ability
60:47
ability
60:49
to learn and if you're smart you can
60:52
learn quickly okay so that's interesting
60:55
13 with no error with no error no
60:58
mistakes you've got it
61:00
perfectly or exactly exactly correct
61:05
that's like
61:08
that's like exactly perfect
61:11
exactly right right no problems no
61:14
errors okay
61:16
next one why something happened oh no
61:19
it's too bad she got an f i eagle
61:23
it's there's some reason what is the
61:26
reason she got an f the reason explains
61:29
why something happened
61:31

61:34
are many reasons why she got an f one
61:37
she didn't sleep last night two she
61:40
didn't study three she played a video
61:43
game all night
61:46
there are many reasons why something
61:48
happened many reasons why somebody would
61:51
get an f so
61:53
i hope that doesn't happen to you make
61:55
sure there is no reason for you to get
61:57
an f there should only be a reason for
61:59
you to get an a
62:01
okay
62:02
number 15 to make a point in a test or a
62:06
game to make a point or when you look at
62:08
the points for both teams or for people
62:11
we're talking about the score so when we
62:14
use the word score a very common
62:17
question is
62:18
what
62:19
is
62:21
the
62:22
score so
62:25
imagine
62:27
korea and japan are playing a soccer
62:30
game right and you want to know what is
62:32
the score then of course you say well
62:35
korea has eight points and japan has
62:40
zero right that's the score eight to
62:43
zero eight to zero okay
62:46
maybe okay what's the score what are the
62:48
points that each team got or each person
62:52
got that's the score when we talk about
62:54
the score we usually talk about both
62:57
teams eight to zero okay or you could
63:00
say what is your score on a test because
63:03
it's also a test my score was 89.
63:08
that's pretty good but it's better if
63:10
your score is a hundred right
63:12
that's a perfect score so hopefully you
63:14
get a hundred okay that would be a score
63:18
on a test okay
63:21
the next word to think that something is
63:24
true so if you think something is true
63:27
you
63:28
believe in something in this case we
63:30
have a picture of santa claus do you
63:32
believe in santa claus of course in that
63:35
case you think that santa claus is real
63:37
and it's true
63:39
um that to believe something to think
63:41
that something is true you believe in
63:45
something okay
63:46
okay well let's go over the vocabulary
63:49
exercises exercise number one what is
63:52
our directions complete each sentence
63:55
with a word from the box so we have
63:58
eight words in the box we're gonna have
64:00
eight sentences to fill in the blanks
64:04
each sentence we have to choose which
64:06
word goes into the blank for the
64:09
sentence we have a lot of words what are
64:11
they of course these are words we just
64:12
studied the first one is
64:15
discovered
64:17
discovered remember we studied the word
64:19
discover but now we're using it in the
64:21
past tense discovered
64:24
okay
64:25
bucket we learned singular bucket more
64:28
than one bucket is buckets
64:30
buckets
64:32
okay next one
64:33
repeat to do over repeat but this one is
64:37
repeated
64:39
repeated okay next one
64:42
we learned shock but remember we can say
64:45
shocked
64:46
shocked
64:48
okay next one
64:49
experiment there's a really long word
64:52
right experiment
64:55
experiment okay next one
64:58
switch
65:00
switch okay
65:03
switch that might be a little difficult
65:05
with the sw you exchange or you move one
65:09
for the other
65:10
switch
65:12
select
65:14
select ted okay selected
65:17
selected
65:19
next one professor
65:21
professor
65:22
okay those are the words let's see
65:25
if we can put these into these sentences
65:27
correctly i hope so number one he will
65:30
beep
65:31
the old bucket with a new one
65:34
so think about that we have two things
65:36
here right we have an old bucket we have
65:38
a new one so we have two buckets we have
65:41
an old bucket and a new bucket what were
65:43
you what are we going to do we're going
65:45
to take the old bucket maybe throw it
65:47
away and we're going to use the new
65:49
bucket so what are we doing in this case
65:52
right we're taking one removing it and
65:55
putting another one in its place
65:58
so in that case we are going to switch
66:02
switch he will
66:04
switch the old bucket with a new one and
66:08
this is probably what you do in your
66:10
life too if you have something that's
66:12
old or broken you throw it away or you
66:15
get rid of it and you put a new one
66:17
instead for example batteries you switch
66:21
the battery in your phone don't throw
66:23
away your old battery recharge it but
66:26
maybe you have two batteries so you
66:28
switch them the new battery for the old
66:30
one you recharge the old one that's a
66:32
good example switch switch batteries
66:36
two the beep wants to give the elephant
66:39
a math test
66:41
okay that's an interesting sentence
66:43
that's part of the reading by the way
66:44
okay so if somebody wants to give a
66:47
elephant a math test who would do that
66:50
right think about that and we need a
66:52
person right the professor wants to give
66:56
the elephant a math test basically
66:59
that's the only one that we can use here
67:01
because professor is a person right and
67:03
that's the only person we've got up here
67:05
so the professor wants to give the
67:07
elephant a math test
67:10
okay number two
67:12
the workers beep gold and diamonds in
67:14
the cave
67:16
what do the workers do they
67:19
there's gold and diamonds in a cave
67:22
how do they
67:24
what are they going to do with those
67:25
things now
67:26
not all caves have gold and diamonds too
67:28
bad right if you go to a cave there's
67:30
probably not going to be golden diamonds
67:32
in there but if you're looking around oh
67:34
look if you find the golden diamonds
67:37
there what did you do you discovered
67:40
gold and diamonds in the cave okay so
67:42
discovered they discovered golden
67:44
diamonds they found golden diamonds in
67:47
the cave okay the next one
67:49
they beep the same test three times
67:54
three times
67:56
they did it three times not just once
67:59
but they did it again and again and one
68:01
more time again okay so what word means
68:05
that you do something not just once
68:08
but twice or three times or four times
68:11
right what means that you do something
68:13
more than once that's this word right
68:15
here repeated they repeated the same
68:18
test three times okay that's the word
68:21
that makes sense there
68:23
number five
68:25
fill the beep with water from the well
68:28
ah okay remember we looked at this
68:31
container that holds something and it's
68:34
usually this container is made of metal
68:36
or plastic and of course i said you
68:38
usually use it to carry water or sand or
68:41
something that's heavy
68:43
what is it what is that container that
68:45
we use to carry stuff ah there it is
68:48
right there bucket fill the buckets with
68:51
water from the well okay
68:55
the next one six the scientist is doing
68:58
and what in the lab what do scientists
69:02
do remember before i talked about a
69:05
scientist has
69:06
many questions about the world they want
69:09
to
69:10
make tests
69:12
to see if the question is yes or no
69:15
will this thing burn if i increase the
69:18
temperature that is what that is an
69:21
experiment the scientist is doing an
69:24
experiment in the lab okay
69:28
our last two sentences
69:31
a shia
69:32
a shia is a name it's the name of the
69:34
elephant in the reading passage that
69:36
we're going to read ashia
69:39
beep the one with more apples in it so
69:43
if you've read the passage already what
69:46
did a shia the elephant do a shia the
69:48
elephant right there's one with more
69:51
apples so you think there's more than
69:53
one right you've got one here you've got
69:55
one here maybe there's two or three or
69:57
four in the reading they talk about just
69:59
two but she is going to right take or
70:04
pick
70:05
or
70:06
what what is she gonna do what is the
70:08
elephant gonna do the elephant is going
70:09
to select as she has selected the one
70:12
with more apples in it select choose
70:16
okay
70:17
number eight
70:18
are you beep that an elephant can count
70:23
so
70:24
the fact that an elephant can count
70:26
that's really surprising isn't it that's
70:29
really amazing and it might be so
70:32
surprising that right it's like oh my
70:35
gosh i can't believe it right
70:37
it what means that what word has
70:40
something to do with something that you
70:42
find out that you discover and it's
70:43
really surprising some really surprising
70:45
information what word has to do with
70:48
that well of course shocked are you
70:50
shocked that an elephant can count did
70:53
you know that that's really shocking
70:55
news that's amazing news okay well that
70:58
wraps up the exercise for the vocabulary
71:01
and we've learned a lot of different
71:02
words so now we're going to use those
71:04
we're going to see those words in a
71:06
reading passage so we're going to take a
71:08
short break come back and look at the
71:09
reading passage
71:17
[Music]
71:25
hello everybody welcome back to reading
71:28
for vocabulary are you ready to continue
71:31
with the lessons great because we're
71:33
going to be starting today with lesson
71:36
four the unit title is
71:39
dynamic earth and our lesson title is
71:42
fire under the earth do you know there's
71:45
a fire under the earth we're going to
71:48
talk about that in this lesson so we
71:50
will focus on
71:52
let's learn about a volcano do you know
71:56
what a volcano is well we have a video
71:58
here of what a volcano looks like i'm
72:02
sure you've seen them on television
72:04
right here we have a mountain as you can
72:07
see and look at this there's fire
72:10
coming out of the mountain let's look at
72:12
the video okay wow look at that all of
72:15
this fire is coming out from the top of
72:18
the mountain where is it coming from
72:21
well it's coming from deep below the
72:23
surface of the earth and that's what our
72:26
lesson is about today now before we get
72:29
into uh too much into the lesson of
72:31
course we have to review some important
72:33
vocabulary words so let's begin with the
72:36
first one
72:38
the first one we have a picture here
72:40
this looks like yellowstone national
72:43
park which is a park a very famous park
72:47
in america
72:48
where hot water
72:50
comes out of the ground it comes out
72:53
very suddenly and in great volume it
72:56
suddenly comes up
72:57
shoots up into the sky now there is a
73:01
very specific verb we can use to
73:04
describe exactly that action what is
73:08
that verb that verb is
73:10
gush
73:11
to
73:12
gush so we used to gush to explain when
73:16
something suddenly and in a lot of
73:19
volume comes out
73:22
not just of the earth you know sometimes
73:25
people
73:26
gush too
73:27
do you have a friend who talks very fast
73:30
and very quickly and they say a whole
73:31
lot of stuff they are gushing so you can
73:34
say my friend gushes right that means
73:38
that they're talking very quickly
73:40
and they are saying many things very
73:44
suddenly so
73:45
many things gush right of course in this
73:48
lesson we're going to be talking about
73:51
things that gush from up under the earth
73:54
okay let's move on to the next word
73:57
here we have some three pictures or a
73:59
picture of three objects right and it
74:02
says water or oil but really to be
74:06
honest it's not just water or oil it's
74:10
any substance that doesn't have a shape
74:13
that you can pour into a container you
74:17
can pour out of a container if you pour
74:19
it out it flows over the ground or it
74:22
goes into the ground
74:24
what type of
74:26
substance is that we say that that is
74:30
liquid
74:31
liquid right liquid it's liquid water is
74:35
liquid oil is liquid
74:38
that video that we saw of the volcano
74:41
that's actually
74:42
liquid rock
74:44
isn't that amazing rock can be liquid
74:47
we'll talk about that some more later
74:50
okay the next one wow this looks very
74:53
very very old doesn't it when we look at
74:57
something like this these are ruins
74:59
right
75:00
ruins from a very very old civilization
75:05
you've probably read about rome or a
75:08
long long time ago in china or even in
75:12
korea we can see ruins they're very old
75:16
another word for very old it's an
75:19
adjective that we use it's ancient
75:23
ancient it's a little bit maybe a
75:26
difficult word so ain't
75:28
chant
75:29
ancient
75:30
ancient these are ancient ruins
75:34
okay let's move on
75:36
wow very neat picture that's really cool
75:39
looking isn't it very beautiful right
75:41
here of course we can see another
75:43
volcano this is another volcano here and
75:46
actually we can see many volcanoes right
75:50
to throw out violently if something is
75:53
being thrown out violently what do we
75:55
say we say it's erupting to erupt when a
76:00
volcano begins to throw out
76:03
that very hot rock and smoke and ash
76:09
and also ash ashes you know when you
76:12
have a fire and the smoke goes out
76:14
sometimes pieces of the of the smoke
76:17
fall from the sky onto your arm right
76:19
that's ash it's actually pieces of the
76:21
wood that fly up in the air and come
76:24
down on your arm so ash
76:26
all of this stuff smoke ash molten rock
76:30
is thrown
76:32
out of the volcano when the volcano
76:35
erupts
76:36
okay
76:38
next word
76:39
now we're talking a lot right i keep
76:41
talking about the hot melted rock but
76:43
there's a better word for it right
76:46
there's a better word for it the hot
76:48
melted rock that comes out of a volcano
76:51
we have a specific word for it what is
76:54
it it's called
76:55
lava right before i taught you ash
76:59
that's one of the things that comes out
77:00
of a volcano the other one is smoke and
77:03
finally we have lava lava is very
77:07
dangerous isn't it
77:09
it's it's also difficult to pronounce
77:12
lava lava okay it's hot melted rock
77:17
imagine
77:19
rock that is so hot
77:22
it's red and it's liquid
77:25
don't go near that it's really dangerous
77:28
right so you should not be close to a
77:31
volcano when it erupts right
77:34
because if the lava touches you
77:37
that's really dangerous so you don't
77:39
want to be close to the lava okay
77:44
here's a cute picture
77:45
what's going on with this kitten right
77:48
it's a kitten a baby cat a kitten so it
77:51
was born
77:52
not long ago
77:55
another word for not long ago we can say
77:59
recently
78:01
recently so when we add l y it's an
78:04
adverb it describes you know when it
78:07
happened recently recent well how recent
78:10
it was recently okay so recently means
78:13
it was not long ago recently a little
78:16
bit difficult pronunciation re sent lee
78:21
recently
78:22
recently remember recent
78:25
is just an adjective recently add ly to
78:28
say answer the question how how was it
78:31
right recently
78:33
okay
78:35
number whoa what's wrong with this lady
78:37
she looks very strange while she has
78:40
many arms right well what this picture
78:42
is showing is that she has many things
78:45
to do
78:46
she's very very busy isn't she to be
78:49
busy doing something so
78:52
unfortunately she doesn't have six arms
78:55
right maybe she wishes she had six arms
78:58
but she's very busy she's doing many
79:00
things so she is very active
79:04
active if somebody is active that means
79:08
that they're busy or that they are doing
79:10
something
79:11
by the way what's the opposite of active
79:14
you could say
79:16
passive
79:20
when we talk about people people are
79:22
active or sometimes people are passive
79:26
that means sit back sometimes
79:28
you were passive right oh you had a long
79:30
day at school you go home oh i just want
79:33
to rest i want to watch tv you are being
79:36
passive we use active and passive for
79:39
people
79:40
but we also use active for volcanoes
79:45
if a volcano is active that means it can
79:49
erupt
79:50
soon but we don't say we don't really
79:53
use passive for volcanoes if a volcano
79:56
is dead and it will not erupt then we
79:59
say it's dormant
80:04
dormant so dormant is used for volcano
80:09
a volcano is dormant it's a little
80:12
strange to say a volcano is passive
80:14
people are passive volcanoes are dormant
80:18
okay let's move on
80:20
number eight sleeping now this is our
80:23
word here dormant that i just taught you
80:26
right we say people are passive but we
80:29
say volcanoes
80:30
are dormant and it says sleeping here so
80:34
you know volcanoes aren't really awake
80:37
right they're not really sleeping
80:40
they're either active or they're dormant
80:42
okay of course in this picture this
80:44
volcano has been dormant looks like it's
80:48
been dormant for a long time it has snow
80:50
on it or maybe it's just winter right
80:52
and there's a lot of snow there but this
80:55
volcano is not active it's not
80:57
erupting so it's dormant
81:00
sometimes people can say that volcano is
81:02
sleeping but that's kind of a poetic way
81:05
to describe it it's kind of like oh the
81:07
mountains are sleeping the forest is
81:09
sleeping but usually the technical or
81:12
scientific word is dormant
81:15
okay next one
81:18
hot melted rock found inside the earth
81:20
we saw this picture before when you see
81:23
this picture do you remember the word we
81:25
just learned a little a few seconds ago
81:28
lava
81:29
well
81:30
this is different this
81:32
word is magma so magma is hot melted
81:36
rock found inside the earth and you're
81:39
probably thinking right now
81:41
what's the difference between lava and
81:43
magma it's a good question right
81:46
the the difference is
81:48
location
81:50
location
81:51
in other words where is it
81:55
this one says found inside the earth if
81:59
it's underground if it's deep inside the
82:02
earth we say it's magma
82:05
but when the magma comes to the surface
82:08
when it comes out of the volcano now
82:11
it's in a different location it's on the
82:13
surface and then it is
82:16
lava
82:18
okay so maybe let me do this differently
82:21
a surface
82:22
if it's on the surface
82:24
it is
82:25
lava
82:27
but if it is inside the earth it is
82:30
magma so it all depends on the location
82:34
where is it on the surface lava inside
82:38
the earth magma so we have different
82:41
words for depending on whether it
82:43
whether where it is on where it is okay
82:47
number 10 wow
82:48
where is that that's not on earth that's
82:51
on the moon right
82:52
the outside of an object but when we
82:55
talk about the moon of course the
82:56
astronauts didn't go in the moon right
83:00
they walked where they walked on the
83:03
surface
83:04
on the surface on
83:07
the surface of the moon right on the
83:11
surface of the moon on the surface of
83:14
the earth we don't live in earth right
83:18
we live on the earth right we live on
83:21

83:24
outside of an object is the surface
83:28

83:29
next one a mountain with a hole in the
83:32
top a mountain with a hole in the top
83:35
we've already talked about this word
83:37
i've used it several times already of
83:39
course we're talking about a volcano
83:43
volcano we don't really pronounce the l
83:46
you don't say volcano you say
83:49
volcano
83:51
volcano okay so of course we're talking
83:54
about this it's a mountain there's a
83:56
hole in the top and smoke ash and lava
84:01
come out of the volcano erupt
84:04
okay
84:05
number 12.
84:07
if you're looking at a map let's say
84:09
you're here and you want to go there
84:12
well that's not far away it's not far
84:14
right if it's far it's um right buddha
84:19
but it's kakawayo right not far away we
84:22
say
84:23
nearby
84:25
nearby nearby or you could also say
84:28
close it's close
84:32
it's nearby
84:35
it is
84:36
close it is nearby
84:38
where is the post office oh don't worry
84:41
it's nearby it's close it's not far
84:45
away right okay next one
84:49
a scientist do you want to be a
84:51
scientist like this this looks like an
84:53
exciting job looking and studying the
84:56
heavens
84:57
this is a scientist who studies outer
85:00
space of course there are many many
85:03
scientists
85:05
scientists study different things
85:07
some scientists study life they're
85:10
biologists some scientists study the
85:13
earth they're geologists but this is a
85:16
scientist who studies outer space
85:20
right out the moon the planets the stars
85:24
what do we call that scientist
85:26
we call that scientist an astronomer
85:30
that's a big word right
85:32
astronomer
85:34
astronomer
85:36
astronomer so we say astronomer is a
85:39
scientist who studies outer space
85:43
okay
85:44
number fourteen
85:46
this is a fun thing to do in the
85:48
summertime maybe you go to kwanghwa moon
85:51
in seoul or city hall and they have a
85:54
fountain
85:56
coming from the sidewalk right
85:58
and that's very fun to play in in the
86:00
summer time well a stream of water going
86:03
into the air i just said it it's a
86:06
fountain
86:07
fountain
86:08
fountain okay two sounds found ten a
86:12
fountain and many kids like to play in
86:15
the fountain during the summer okay so
86:18
the next word here we have a picture of
86:21
of a very hot liquid and it's something
86:24
that wasn't liquid before to become
86:27
liquid by heating now before we've
86:29
talked about rock rock being so hot it
86:33
turns into a liquid that's really
86:36
amazing isn't it but if you think about
86:38
it everything on the earth all the
86:41
material you can think of if you heat it
86:45
up
86:46
at a high temperature it turns from a
86:49
solid
86:50
into
86:51
a liquid it goes from solid to
86:55
liquid now what word do we use to
86:58
describe this action we say
87:02
melt to melt
87:04
lt at the end alt
87:06
melt
87:08
melt so if something melts it turns from
87:11
a solid to a liquid it becomes liquid by
87:15
a lot of heat
87:16
we can see melting every day if it's a
87:19
hot summer day and you have ice cubes in
87:23
your water those ice cubes will melt so
87:26
ice melts very easily
87:29
ice cream melts easily you have to eat
87:31
it quickly right now don't eat it too
87:33
quickly right but ice cream will melt
87:36
sometimes people like the melted ice
87:38
cream that's also good okay this is our
87:40
last word and look at the picture wow it
87:44
makes you
87:45
really sleepy right it's like pyeonghan
87:49
right very peaceful there's nobody no
87:53
people in the picture all we can see is
87:55
just like an empty dock the boat is
87:58
empty nobody's there
88:00
the sea is very calm everything is very
88:04
peaceful and what
88:08
quiet
88:09
without much noise or activity so
88:13
imagine if you're there you don't hear
88:14
much noise maybe a little bit of noise
88:16
from the water but it's soothing it's
88:19
peaceful there's no activity nobody's
88:22
running around or making noise the waves
88:25
are very calm it's very quiet very quiet
88:28
scene very peaceful okay it's time to
88:31
begin the exercises for the vocabulary
88:34
in this exercise it says exercise two
88:36
we're skipping exercise one right to
88:39
exercise two we're using a paragraph so
88:42
we're looking at a paragraph and we need
88:45
to complete the paragraph there are
88:47
blanks in the paragraph we need to
88:50
choose the right word to put in the
88:53
blank to finish the paragraph okay so
88:56
what are our words we have five words
88:59
here first one is gush
89:03
gush
89:04
next
89:05
erupt
89:07
erupt
89:08
next one active
89:11
active
89:12
the next one
89:14
dormant
89:15
dormant
89:17
and the final one
89:18
liquid
89:20
liquid those are our five words we have
89:23
to choose which word is the best to put
89:27
into these blanks
89:29
let's take a look the first sentence
89:31
have you ever seen a volcano
89:35
then we have a blank
89:37
we're looking probably for a verb here
89:39
because have you ever seen a volcano do
89:42
something
89:43
well what do volcanoes do right we
89:46
talked about that which well first of
89:48
all if we look at our words only two of
89:51
them are verbs right
89:53
and the two verbs are gush and erupt
89:56
does a volcano gush or does it erupt
89:59
remember before we talked about a
90:01
volcano erupts
90:03
okay
90:04
so a volcano or uh something that's a
90:08
geological
90:09
uh formation like a volcano
90:12
erupts
90:13
that erupts it doesn't gush right that's
90:17
a different meaning we'll see that next
90:18
actually so have you ever seen a volcano
90:21
erupt it's an amazing thing to see this
90:24
is all connected it's all one paragraph
90:26
so have you ever seen it have you ever
90:28
seen a volcano erupt maybe you've seen
90:31
one erupt on television or in the movies
90:33
i don't think you've seen one erupt in
90:35
real life that's kind of rare thank
90:38
goodness but anyway you've probably seen
90:41
a volcano erupt on the television or in
90:43
the movies it's amazing if you do see a
90:46
volcano erupt in real life wow it's
90:49
really incredible but of course be
90:51
careful right
90:52
pay attention to what the police and
90:54
people tell you about active volcanoes
90:57
anyway it's an amazing thing to see
90:59
i like watching the lava beep out from
91:02
the top so the lava what does the lava
91:06
do right we have two verbs here right i
91:08
said we have two verbs gush and erupt
91:10
are both verbs we used erupt we need
91:13
another verb here it's going to be gush
91:16
right
91:17
now that's interesting think about this
91:19
for a minute volcanoes don't gush they
91:22
erupt
91:23
lava doesn't erupt
91:25
it gushes
91:26
what's the difference what's going on a
91:29
volcano is the thing right it's the
91:31
geological feature it explodes it erupts
91:35
okay it doesn't gush what what the the
91:38
substance that comes out of it that's
91:41
what gushes okay so the lava gushes or
91:45
before on the slide we saw before at the
91:48
very beginning we saw water coming out
91:50
of the ground the water was coming out
91:53
of a geyser
91:56
a geyser
91:57
is similar in this sense to a volcano of
92:00
course a geyser is in a big mountain
92:02
it's a hole in the ground where water
92:04
comes out of
92:05
the geyser erupts
92:07
water gushes so you see the thing
92:11
whether it's a volcano or a geyser
92:13
that's the geological thing
92:15
object it erupts
92:18
the substance that comes out
92:20
that gushes so that's a good difference
92:23
that's a good thing to remember okay the
92:26
lava looks like beep fire
92:30
what kind of fire is it active dormant
92:33
or liquid fire remember when we saw the
92:36
video it looked like the rock looked
92:39
like a what liquid
92:41
it looked like a liquid so the lava
92:44
looks like liquid fire
92:46
it's like a liquid that is on fire and
92:49
actually it's very dangerous it is a
92:51
liquid and if you touch it your skin
92:54
will become on fire so don't touch lava
92:57
don't get near lava okay so those are
93:00
our words have you ever seen a volcano
93:02
erupt
93:03
it's an amazing thing to see
93:06
i like watching the lava gush out from
93:09
the top the lava looks like liquid fire
93:13
continuing on the slide but i've only
93:16
seen lava once
93:18
that's because most volcanoes aren't are
93:22
not
93:23
what okay so think about this
93:26
i said it's rare to see a volcano erupt
93:29
because
93:31
most volcanoes are not
93:33
what if a volcano is erupting is it is
93:36
it
93:37
active or is it passive most volcanoes
93:41
are not
93:42
active and that's a good thing right
93:45
we don't want most volcanoes to be
93:47
active because that would be dangerous
93:49
for the people around the volcano most
93:52
volcanoes aren't active most of them are
93:55
what
93:56
what's the opposite pandero of active
93:59
the opposite of active is
94:01
dormant
94:03
dormant so most volcanoes are not active
94:06
they don't erupt they're dormant they
94:09
are like sleeping they don't uh have any
94:12
action they are quiet
94:14
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
94:17
exercises let's take a short break and
94:20
we'll come back and do the reading
94:28
[Music]
94:36
hello everybody welcome back to reading
94:38
for vocabulary i'm brian stewart we're
94:41
going over lesson five now the title for
94:44
lesson five is never a warm day
94:48
never a warm day well obviously we're
94:52
not talking about korea because korea
94:55
has many warm days right that's good
94:57
right we don't want to be cold all the
95:00
time but we're talking about a place
95:03
that never has a warm day so we're going
95:06
to focus on let's learn about the arctic
95:10
in the arctic there's never a warm day
95:13
it's always cold so we're talking about
95:17
geography that falls under social
95:19
studies
95:20
well first of all let's talk about the
95:22
arctic as you can see it's very cold in
95:27
the arctic right very cold
95:29
never a warm day it never gets very warm
95:33
there it's always covered with snow and
95:36
ice and the animals that live there are
95:40
used to the cold weather in the arctic
95:43
okay let's begin with our vocabulary
95:46
frost just jumped on up in there right a
95:49
covering of ice so when it's really cold
95:52
outside right and you can see the plants
95:55
or the grass the trees are covered with
95:59
a very thin covering of ice we call that
96:02
frost
96:03
frost is on the grass frost is on the
96:07
trees
96:08
frost is on your windows sometimes okay
96:12
so it's a thin covering of ice that
96:14
covers things when it's very cold
96:18
number two well she's very she must be a
96:21
famous person right she looks like a
96:23
famous singer
96:24

96:26
gave you the answer famous or popular i
96:30
said famous before it's a synonym it
96:33
means the same thing famous
96:36
popular
96:37
many people like that person or thing it
96:42
is popular or it is
96:44
famous
96:45
okay
96:47
number three
96:48
now imagine if you lived here
96:50
this is your dog and you live at a home
96:53
near here the only way to get to your
96:56
home is by boat
96:58
wow
96:59
that is a far away place or remote
97:04
it is remote remote means far away or
97:08
hard to get to right if you live in an
97:11
island you can't drive a car there right
97:14
there's no roads you have to take a boat
97:16
it's far away from a city so it's hard
97:20
to get to it's remote remote
97:24
remote
97:25
okay next word
97:27

97:29

97:32
woman is not common she's not behaving
97:36

102:19
we just use this word and we use this
102:22
word and we put them together what do we
102:25
have we have a story book so a storybook

storybook
102:35
next one
102:36
an area of the earth
102:39
so an area of the earth especially
102:41
farmers use this to grow crops what do
102:44
we call it of course it's land they need
102:47
land to grow food
102:50
so an area of the earth is land
102:55
the area around the north pole now it's
102:58
maybe a little hard to see but if you
103:00
look closely you can start to recognize
103:02
some of the shapes here this is north
103:04
america here
103:06
this is greenland
103:08
greenland it's not green it's white but
103:10
we don't say white land we say green
103:11
land
103:12
that's history okay the green land and
103:15
of course here we have the top of asia
103:17
this is russia around here korea's down
103:20
over here right so what were we looking
103:22
at we're looking at the area around the
103:25
north pole what do we call that area
103:28
there's a special word for it we already
103:30
talked about it it's called the arctic
103:34
arctic we don't say really we don't
103:37
really pronounce that c we don't say
103:39
arctic
103:41
that's
103:42
we say arctic arctic we don't really
103:45
pronounce the sea it's not arctic it's
103:48
arctic arctic
103:50
okay arctic
103:51
that's the area around the north pole
103:54
it's very cold up there
103:56
next one in the place of something or
103:59
somebody in the place of something or
104:02
somebody it's kind of a difficult word
104:04
it is instead
104:06
instead of right so instead of cars
104:10
these people are riding bicycles right
104:13
and instead of bicycles these people are
104:15
riding cars so in the place of something
104:18
or somebody
104:20
if you say not this one but another
104:23
thing instead of this then that
104:26
okay next one
104:27
number 14 what we ride over snow and ice
104:32
now in the arctic it's very cold
104:35
you can't really make a road because it
104:37
snows too much if you make a road after
104:40
a month you can't see the road anymore
104:42
because it's covered with snow so people
104:45
don't have cars they use these things
104:49
to move around what are they called
104:51
they're called sleds a sled
104:54
maybe you have a sled when it gets cold
104:57
in the winter time you might take a sled
104:59
to the hill and ride down the sled for
105:02
fun a lot of kids do that they ride a
105:04
sled over snow in the arctic they use
105:07
dogs to pull the sled and that's how
105:10
they get around because cars are not
105:12
very useful in the arctic or very cold
105:15
areas sleds are better
105:18
the next one a small round house made of
105:21
snow you've probably seen these before
105:24
right
105:25
and when it's very cold people will make
105:27
these out of ice they'll make them out
105:29
of snow
105:30
it's a little house very interesting
105:32
house right chemisoil right how would
105:34
you like to live there maybe a little
105:37
bit cold but it's actually warm inside
105:40
it's warmer inside than outside what is
105:43
it called it's called an igloo
105:46
igloo right and igloo is a house made of
105:50
snow or ice in the arctic or antarctic
105:55
to sense sounds now of course we have
105:57
many organs in our head that we use to
106:01
know what's going on around us right
106:04
when we use our eyes we're seeing when
106:06
we use our mouth our tongue we're
106:08
tasting but when we use our ears what
106:11
are we doing then we are
106:14
hearing to hear is to sense sounds right
106:18
now you are listening to me you are
106:21
hearing the noises the sounds that i'm
106:24
making it here is an irregular verb hear
106:28
heard heard
106:30
so uh
106:31
maybe you
106:33
uh heard me yesterday too as also today
106:37
maybe you're studying very hard right so
106:38
here heard heard we use herd to describe
106:42
sensing sounds in the past
106:45
okay let's go
106:46
for the reading of the vocabulary
106:48
exercises sorry the vocabulary exercises
106:51
we have several words here we need to
106:54
fill in the blanks very easy exercise
106:56
right so we have our sentences we need
106:58
to use these words to complete each
107:00
sentence let's go over the words the
107:03
first one is
107:04
frost
107:06
frost
107:07
then
107:08
popular
107:10
popular
107:11
then
107:12
unusual
107:14
unusual
107:16
next one is shine
107:18
shine
107:20
next one frigid
107:22
frigid
107:24
frigid right
107:26
opposite
107:28
opposite
107:29
next one remote
107:32
remote
107:34
and the next one predict
107:37
predict
107:38
okay so let's use these words figure out
107:41
how we can put them into the sentences
107:44
number one
107:45
i got cold i got cold i became cold
107:49
because of the peep weather what kind of
107:52
weather makes you cold
107:55
what kind of weather makes you cold
107:58
probably this word is what we're looking
108:00
for frigid
108:02
very cold remember frigid is very cold
108:05
so if the weather is very cold
108:07
you become cold you will get cold i got
108:11
cold because of the frigid weather
108:13
number two
108:15
oh by the way it's interesting
108:17
this says i got cold that just means you
108:20
are not warm anymore but if you add one
108:23
little word
108:24
and you put a
108:26
i got a cold it's completely different
108:29
that means you got sick up i o
108:32
right i got a cold i became sick because
108:36
of the frigid weather but if you don't
108:38
use a and you just say i got cold it
108:40
just means your body was cold you didn't
108:43
get sick you go inside you get warm no
108:45
problem
108:46
so it's sometimes in english it's very
108:49
important whether you use a or no a
108:52
changes the meaning okay just a little
108:54
note
108:55
number two
108:56
after the heavy rain so after it rained
109:00
very heavily after the heavy rain the
109:03
sun began to
109:04
what
109:06
so after it rains the clouds go away you
109:09
can see the sun the sun begins to what
109:12
give off light it begins to
109:15
shine okay so the sun began to shine
109:19
after the heavy rain
109:21
number three
109:23
the arctic is a very big
109:26
place not many people go to the arctic
109:29
it's very difficult to live there like i
109:32
said before you can't really build a
109:34
road in the arctic so it's hard to get
109:37
to the arctic a place that is hard to
109:40
get to is remote the arctic is a very
109:44
remote place it's hard to get to
109:49
number four in winter his car window was
109:52
covered with what i talked about this
109:55
when we talked about this word when it's
109:57
really cold outside
110:00
there will be a covering of ice on
110:02
plants on grass
110:05
on your windows what do we call that ice
110:08
we call that ice frost so in winter his
110:12
car window
110:13
was covered with frost
110:17
okay number five
110:19
the beep of hot is cold
110:22
interesting hot and cold pandero right
110:26
they are what they are opposites so the
110:29
opposite of hot is cold right the
110:34
opposite of happy is sad right the
110:38
opposite of tall is short okay so the
110:42
opposite of a is
110:44
b right that's a good thing of course a
110:46
and b are opposites pandero okay
110:49
number six i can't beep the result of
110:52
the match
110:54
the result of the match match here means
110:56
like game or contest for example a
110:59
soccer match right
111:01
do you know who will win
111:03
sometimes it's hard to tell it's very
111:06
difficult to know the future so i can't
111:10
when you know the future you probably
111:12
don't know the future of course it's
111:13
very difficult to know the future it's
111:16
very difficult to know who will win the
111:18
match
111:19
which team will win so it's difficult to
111:22
predict i can't predict the result of
111:25
the match i don't know i can't tell the
111:29
future okay i'm not a champion
111:32
okay next one number seven he is a very
111:35
beep singer in korea
111:38
so we're looking for something that has
111:40
to do with singer or entertainers or
111:42
actors of course if a singer
111:45
is to be
111:46
successful many people have to like that
111:50
person
111:51
so
111:52
if we're talking about somebody who is
111:55
many people like them he is a very what
111:57
he's a very popular singer in korea and
112:02
number eight
112:03
she is a girl with what ability she is a
112:07
girl with some type of ability the only
112:10
word left of course but also we're
112:12
looking for something that's
112:14
uh makes her unique makes her different
112:17
from other people
112:19
she's a girl with unusual ability of
112:22
course people with unusual ability you
112:24
know could be a good thing
112:27
somebody who sings very well that's not
112:28
common that's unusual somebody who has a
112:31
very good voice so somebody who has an
112:33
unusual talent they can become famous as
112:36
an entertainer or even or in many other
112:39
fields right if you have an unusual
112:42
ability to do math in your head you can
112:45
become a scientist or a teacher or a
112:49
mathematician right so if you have an
112:51
unusual ability sometimes that's very
112:54
good it's not common you should develop
112:56
that ability okay anyway that wraps it
112:59
up with the vocabulary let's take a
113:01
short break now and we'll take a look at
113:03
the reading section in a few minutes
113:12
[Music]
113:20
hello kids how are you doing today
113:22
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
113:25
i'm brian stewart we're on lesson six
113:30
fossil fuels so in this lesson we will
113:33
focus on
113:35
let's learn about how plants from
113:38
long ago
113:40
can cause pollution today and of course
113:44
pollution is not good for our bodies so
113:47
our topic our subject is health right so
113:50
that's what we'll be talking about in
113:53
this lesson
113:54
let's take a look here first of all what
113:57
are fossil fuels there are many kinds of
114:02
fossil fuels in this video here we can
114:05
see these machines working in a field or
114:09
in a plane what are these machines doing
114:12
they're getting oil from the ground
114:15
they're pumping up oil from deep
114:17
underground and oil
114:20
oil
114:21
is a fossil fuel we make gas
114:26
out of
114:27
oil right kyung kyung-yu i think you say
114:30
in korean kyung-yu right
114:33
where you go to the juju so the gas
114:35
station and you get fuel
114:37
right so oil is made into gas it's a
114:40
type of fossil fuel also we'll look at
114:43
other types of fossil fuels in this
114:46
lesson
114:47
okay our first word for the vocabulary
114:51
he's very happy he's very proud i hope
114:53
you get the same thing he got an a plus
114:56
yay
114:57
right it can be done yes you can get an
115:01
a plus it is
115:03
possible yes you can do it right it's
115:06
possible you can do it you can do it it
115:11
is possible okay number two
115:14
wow very exciting picture of course he
115:17
is a firefighter
115:20
fire fighter
115:22
and the word though is not firefighter
115:24
it is to need now when we say to need
115:27
what's another word for that it's
115:29
require a firefighter needs water to put
115:34
out the fire he requires
115:37
water to put out the fire to require now
115:42
maybe a little difficult pronunciation
115:45
require
115:47
require so to require is to need
115:51
something you say pill yohada right
115:53
yohada i need it
115:56
i need it i require it it i must have it
115:59
okay number three
116:02
this is a big city looks like new york
116:04
central park is in the background but
116:06
when we talk about all big cities any
116:09
big city connected with a city connected
116:13
with a city we say urban
116:16
urban so if you live in a city you are
116:21
living in an urban
116:23
setting you are living in an urban
116:26
setting but
116:27
if you live on a farm in the countryside
116:31
you are living in a rural
116:34
setting so urban and
116:37
rural
116:38
rural pandero right they are opposites
116:42
so i live in a city i live in an urban
116:47
place or setting i live in a farm i live
116:50
in a rural place or setting okay so
116:54
rural is countryside urban is city okay
116:59
number four having to do with factories
117:02
so when we say when we talk about
117:04
factories and factories that are making
117:07
things and machines the process of
117:10
manufacturing we're usually talking
117:13
about
117:14
industrial
117:15
topics or industrial things industrial
117:19
is an adjective having to do with
117:22
factories uh
117:24
this job is an industrial job right uh
117:29
this uh business deal is an industrial
117:33
business deal having to do with
117:35
factories
117:36
in industrial
117:39
industrial industrial okay so the
117:42
pronunciation it's a long word
117:45
industry oh
117:47
industrial okay
117:49
okay next one number five well this is
117:52
very interesting what is this if we look
117:54
closely
117:56
this is rock right it's par it's a piece
117:59
of rock but there's some strange oh it
118:02
looks kind of scary it's a spider right
118:04
it's a spider that died a long long time
118:08
ago and a long time ago this rock was
118:12
mud it was soft and the spider's body
118:15
laid there and got covered with mud and
118:18
got pressed and because of the pressure
118:20
it turned into rock so that all that is
118:23
left of the spider is this form or this
118:27
shape in the rock it's all that remains
118:31
all that remains the remains of the
118:34
spider
118:35
is all that is left of this spider is
118:38
the shape of the spider in the rock
118:41
so if something is gone something it
118:44
goes away or something dies
118:46
sometimes there are
118:48
there's a little bit that remains from
118:51
that thing that died a long time ago
118:54
remains remains
118:57
okay next one number six
118:59
uh to come together when things come
119:02
together what do they do they form
119:05
something okay so they form a field they
119:09
might form a landscape when you put like
119:13
wood and concrete and other materials
119:17
together
119:18
you can form a house or a building it's
119:21
when you make you
119:23
have many things or materials come
119:26
together they form or make or create
119:30
some other thing they form something
119:33
okay
119:35
seven are you hungry looks like
119:37
somebody's cooking something right a
119:39
series of actions or changes when you
119:42
cook something you're doing a series of
119:45
actions step one step two step three you
119:49
follow many actions or changes different
119:52
steps
119:53
we call all of those steps together
119:56
that's called a process
119:59
what is the process of making chocolate
120:02
chip cookies what is the process of
120:04
making a pancake you follow the
120:07
different steps those steps are a
120:09
process
120:11
how to do something okay next one number
120:14
eight
120:15
maybe your mom or dad does this a lot
120:17
maybe you do it right if the light goes
120:19
out in your room you know you flip the
120:21
switch
120:23
it doesn't work it's time to change
120:26
something for something else so you take
120:28
the old light bulb
120:31
it's a light bulb by the way
120:33
you take the old light bulb and you put
120:36
a new light bulb in its place what are
120:38
you doing you are replacing
120:42
replace the old one uh with a new one
120:46
you replace the old one get rid of the
120:48
old one put a new one you replace it
120:51
replace the old one with a new one
120:53
replace the old light bulb with a new
120:56
light bulb okay
120:58
number nine
121:00
to let go right very interesting picture
121:02
i think it's been photoshopped okay but
121:04
anyway this person is letting these
121:07
doves these birds go right to let go
121:10
means
121:11
to release let go right if you love
121:15
something release it if it comes back to
121:18
you it loves you too but if it doesn't
121:21

121:23
it never was to be oh well so anyway to
121:25
release something to release let it go
121:28
let it go release it release
121:31
release
121:33
let it go
121:34
number 10

to save now this looks strange what are
121:38
they saving well they're saying what
121:40
what are they doing they're digging in
121:42
the ground they're going to
121:44
plant trees or bushes so they are trying
121:48
to save the earth
121:50
so what are they doing they are
121:52
conserving especially when we talk about
121:55
protecting the environment or trying to
121:58
save the earth we are talking about
122:00
conserving the earth now you can also
122:03
conserve other things if you are careful
122:07
with the electricity you use in your
122:10
house turn off the light when you leave
122:13

the soap off conserve water save water
122:32
save electricity save the earth
122:35
conservation project okay
122:38
conserve
122:40
conserve is the way we pronounce that
122:44
eleven
122:45
what's that doesn't look very pretty but
122:47
it's very important
122:49
a black stone burned for heat what do we
122:52
call it we call it
122:55
coal c is a hard k
122:58
sound coal
123:01

123:05
this picture and we burn it for heat
123:08
if you go to uh
123:10
what do you say bulgogi or gogi jeep
123:13
bulgogi jeep you want to get bulgogi or

uh some places where they have the the
123:18
the outside barbecue right they put coal
123:22
in the fire
123:24
underneath and they burn it right and
123:25
that's an example of coal you can see it
123:28
every day right so blackstone burned for
123:31
heat is coal coal is very important for
123:35
our modern life
123:38
next one
123:39
you don't worry about this you're not

123:44
careful look at the gas right because
123:47
when you become when you when you
123:50
use up all the gas you use up all the
123:54
gas no more
123:58

124:03
out and the way to use it
124:05
run

of
124:10
momo
124:11
run out of gas run out of food run out

124:44
pipes into the stream it's making the
124:47
stream or the river
124:49

124:53
when

124:55
we make the environment dirty we are
124:59
polluting the environment and sometimes
125:02
factories or industrial places
125:06
industrial companies will pollute the
125:09
environment because of what they're
125:11
doing their activities make dirty water

urban and we can see
129:40
u r b a n one two three four five one
129:45

129:48
point about crossword puzzles you have
129:51

same number of letters
129:58
in the blank so you're looking for a
130:00

131:07
that's our ten letter word that matches
131:09
the picture
131:11

131:12
number eight
131:14
aha we're following a certain series of
131:16
steps to cook something or you know to
131:20

131:21
cooking it can be anything we need one
131:24
two three four five six seven
131:26
seven words where is a seven letter word
131:30
that me has to do with this picture
131:33
one two three four five six seven aha
131:36
that's our word it is
131:38
process
131:40
process of course you can't just do
131:43
the number of words you have to make
131:44
sure it matches the picture right a
131:46
process is a series of steps that you do
131:50
a series of actions or changes to do
131:53
something
131:55
okay
131:56
that was the words that were across they
131:58
all had pictures now we're looking at
132:00
the words that go down in the in the
132:03
puzzle the words that go down the clues
132:06
are part of a sentence it's like filling
132:08
in the blank except in this case the
132:11
blank is the box right the box is for
132:14
each letter of the word what word makes
132:17
sense in this sentence babies beep care
132:20
and attention
132:23
babies need something right babies need
132:26
care and attention what's another word
132:28
for need that we talked about would it
132:31
be
132:32
require one two three four five six
132:35
seven one two three four five six seven
132:38
aha that fits and it makes sense
132:42
babies require care and attention that's
132:46
true so that's the correct answer
132:49
number four
132:50
i gave the beep
132:52
of my lunch to the dog i gave the what
132:56
of my lunch to the dog well think about
132:59
that do you have a dog when you eat food
133:02
your dog looks at you like this
133:04
right
133:05
so after you finish eating maybe you
133:08
don't eat everything so you give what's
133:11
left
133:12
to your dog right what is left is the
133:16
what it's the remains you give the
133:19
remains of your lunch maybe a piece of
133:21
bread or maybe some rice or maybe a
133:24
piece of apple dogs eat apples right so
133:27
you give the remains of your lunch to
133:29
your dog but don't do that actually
133:32
because your dog will beg you every time
133:35
you eat right so it's not good to give
133:37
the remains of your lunch or dinner to
133:39
your dog give them their food separately
133:42
okay next one number five down
133:46
new cars will beep the older cars
133:49
remember we talked about this you
133:52
change one thing for another if
133:54
something's old it doesn't work you
133:56
remove it and you put a new one in its
133:59
place what are you doing you are
134:01
replacing new cars will replace
134:06
the older cars so you will replace you
134:09
will replace the old one with a new one
134:12
replace new cars
134:15
to
134:16
new cars will replace the older cars
134:18
they will replace the older cars okay
134:22
number six
134:24
it is
134:25
beep but not easy
134:28
so when we talk about this is a little
134:29
bit more difficult right
134:32
you can do many things some things you
134:34
can do are very easy but some things you
134:36
can do are very hard don't give up even
134:40
though it's very hard you can do it it's
134:43
what it's
134:45
possible
134:46
it's possible but not easy
134:50
just because something is hard or not
134:54
easy doesn't mean it's not possible
134:56
right many things in your life will be
134:59
hard to do but you can do it it's
135:01
possible it is possible to do
135:06
okay that wraps it up for the vocabulary
135:09
crossword puzzle it's kind of fun uh
135:11
putting a crossword puzzle together
135:13
isn't it but in every crossword puzzle
135:16
you have to find the clues across and
135:18
then down and you can mix them up and of
135:21
course remember pay attention to the
135:22
number of letters in each box okay well
135:26
let's take a short break here we'll come
135:27
back soon and we'll go over the reading
135:29
passage together
135:31
[Music]
135:37
[Music]
135:45
hey everybody welcome back to reading
135:47
for vocabulary i'm brian stewart
135:50
we're on lesson seven right now
135:53
do you hear that what do you hear what
135:55
no i'm just kidding that's the name of
135:57
the lesson right do you hear that do you
136:00
hear that we're going to focus on let's
136:03
learn
136:05
what sound is
136:07
so we're going to study about sound what
136:10
exactly is sound when we talk about
136:12
things like sound or sight or smells
136:16
that's an area of science so we're
136:19
talking about science in this lesson
136:22
first of all what is sound you know when
136:24
we talk about sound
136:27
sound is something that we hear through
136:30
our ears whether it's somebody who's
136:33
yelling somebody who speaks in a loud
136:36
voice
136:37
loud voice
136:39
so they could be
136:41
yelling
136:42
yell to yell
136:44
he's yelling or he's shout
136:49
shout ing right shouting so sometimes we
136:53
hear loud sounds when people are
136:55
speaking in a loud voice they're
136:56
shouting or they're yelling
136:59
i'm not shouting or yelling i won't do
137:01
that to you but i'm not whispering
137:04
either right pandiro yelling or shouting
137:07
is
137:08
whisper
137:10
whisper
137:11
whisper very small sound whispering
137:16
okay now down here
137:18
this is a problem with electronic
137:21
devices your computers your music
137:24
players somebody's playing loud music
137:29
it's too loud please
137:34
please
137:35
turn
137:37
it
137:38
down
137:40
turn it down
137:42
means turn down the volume it's too loud
137:46
he will say to his friend hey
137:48
please turn it down it's too loud
137:51
okay let's talk about some vocabulary
137:54
having to do with sound
137:56
the first word is to hit hard when
138:00
something hits something very hard like
138:03
lightning comes from the sky and hits
138:05
the ground
138:07
hard what do we say we say it's strike
138:10
and this is a good picture because
138:12
usually we call
138:14
this type of action lightning strike if
138:18
the lightning touches the ground we say
138:21
where did it strike
138:23
where did it strike ground but there's
138:25
other things we can talk about when we
138:27
strike something if we're playing a drum
138:30
we strike the drum with a a drum stick
138:34
and we make a sound so it's a strike to
138:36
hit something hard strike
138:39
okay number two
138:43
very strange people it's it's kind of
138:46
hard to have pictures when you're
138:48
describing a sound right so some of
138:50
these pictures we have to think a little
138:52
bit okay this is a picture of a sound
138:55
telling of a danger these people are not
138:58
crazy
138:59
they're supposed to be they're supposed
139:02
to be very frightened or scared why
139:05
because they heard a sound that tells
139:08
them of danger what kind of sound tells
139:12
you of a danger if there's a fire in
139:15
your apartment building
139:17
what can you hear some sound will go off
139:20
telling you be careful there's a fire we
139:24
call that sound an alarm
139:27
a fire alarm if a robber or a bad person
139:32
breaks a window to get into a store at
139:35
night to steal something then a burglar
139:39
alarm will go off a burglar
139:41
burglar
139:43
a burglar is the bad person the criminal
139:46
who breaks into the store a burglar
139:49
alarm a fire alarm that's a sound that
139:52
tells you hey
139:54
danger there's something bad happening
139:58
three
139:59
now a message a message telling that
140:02
something bad may happen not an alarm
140:07
it's before an alarm right
140:09
you see a sign
140:11
that says
140:13
be careful joshum
140:15
something bad might happen the word we
140:19
want actually is on the sign itself it's
140:22
a warning warning
140:24
warning joshim heyo right mori joshum
140:27
hail watch for your head right watch
140:29
your head or in this case
140:31
don't go
140:33
on the land don't go past this sign it's
140:36
dangerous
140:37
warning
140:39
warning it's something it's a message
140:41
that tells us something bad may happen
140:44
we should pay attention to warnings
140:47
look at warnings they will help keep you
140:50
safe
140:51
okay next one number three number four
140:54
how high or low a sound is
140:57
now when we talk about sound and we'll
140:59
look at this more in the reading
141:01
you can say a sound is high or low
141:05
in terms of what in terms of
141:08
pitch
141:09
now when you say high sound or low sound
141:12
think of it this way an alarm clock you
141:14
know might sound like this
141:17
that's a high sound
141:19
alarm sounds don't sound like this
141:22
that's a low sound okay so you have a
141:24
high sound and you have a low sound when
141:27
we talk about that we're talking about
141:30
the pitch
141:32
pitch
141:33
what is the pitch of the sound usually
141:37
we say it's a high pitched high
141:41
pitched
141:44
high pitched or low
141:47
pitched
141:49
sound
141:50
right another couple of examples a small
141:53
dog right a small dog goes
141:57
that's a high pitched sound but a big
141:59
dog goes
142:01
right that's a low pitched sound so
142:04
high-pitched sound low pitched sound
142:06
we're talking about pitch
142:09
number five
142:10
what's wrong she's so she's so crazy
142:13
she's really angry right
142:15
how loud or soft a sound is maybe she's
142:20
crying she's screaming now we're talking
142:23
about
142:24
loudness or softness remember before i
142:28
told you if something's too loud you say
142:30
turn it down you want to turn down the
142:34
volume okay
142:36
so we have a loud sound the volume is
142:40
high
142:41
a soft sound the volume is low i can't
142:45
hear it right
142:47
please turn up the volume so high volume
142:51
low volume and as you can see we also
142:54
use high pitch low pitch so we use the
142:57
words high and low to talk about pitch
143:00
or to talk about volume high pitch high
143:03
volume
143:04
low pitch low volume but they're
143:06
different things right pitch and volume
143:09
are two different things about sound
143:13
okay number six
143:15
again it's hard to draw a picture or to
143:17
show a picture of a sound in this case
143:20
to make a long deep sound
143:25
here you have to imagine you know if you
143:27
see a lightning storm right you see
143:30
lightning but after the lightning what
143:33
do you hear after the lightning you hear
143:36
thunder right
143:37
and thunder
143:39
is a long deep sound it is a rumble
143:47
the rumble
143:48
right especially if you hear
143:51
see the lightning it's very close to you
143:53
now you hear
143:54
and it goes
143:55
it's not the big thunder that that
143:57
happens right away that's not long
144:00
that's very short it's bang whoa but
144:02
then you can hear the rumble for a
144:04
little bit afterwards it's very deep and
144:06
surrounding sound
144:08
in the sky that's a rumble also if
144:12
you're hungry
144:13
your stomach will rumble
144:16
right oh i'm hungry
144:18
right it's time to eat so your stomach
144:21
might rumble okay
144:24
okay next one
144:26
to shake quickly these guys are a street
144:30
construction crew before they uh change
144:33
the street they have to break the street
144:35
up so they use a jackhammer this is a
144:39
jack
144:40
hammer and the way the jackhammer works
144:43
is it moves up and down very quickly to
144:46
shake what is it doing is it like this
144:49
it's
144:50
vibrating to vibrate
144:53
vibrate okay to shake quickly back and
144:56
forth is to vibrate
144:59
okay number eight
145:01
to pull
145:02
and then let go to pull and let go you
145:06
can all say what are they doing with the
145:08
guitar they are plucking the guitar not
145:11
right now right now they're tuning the
145:13
guitar but after they do that then he or
145:17
she i'm not sure
145:19
okay because long hair i don't know
145:22
he or she is going to
145:24
uh touch this the strings but pluck the
145:27
strings very quickly going to pull the
145:29
string and then let go and that's how
145:32
many string instruments are played you
145:34
pluck the strings
145:37
right you pull them quickly and then let
145:39
go you pluck
145:41
you also maybe pluck your hair don't do
145:44
that but some people might do that they
145:46
pluck to pull and then let go pull the
145:49
hair let go
145:50
pluck
145:52
now this person is a referee a referee
145:56
at a game maybe you're playing soccer or
145:58
you're playing uh baseball or something
146:01
and the referee has a whistle a whistle
146:06
and when he blows that whistle
146:09
right there is a loud high pitched sound
146:14
coming from the lips or whistles what is
146:17
that it's a whistle the same one that i
146:19
just wrote up there so we call this this
146:22
um instrument you can't see it it's made
146:25
of metal but what he has in his mouth
146:28
it's a whistle
146:29
also it's a verb so this whistle that i
146:32
put up here this would be a noun
146:35
and a high sound coming from lips or
146:37
whistles well of course the sound is a
146:40
is a noun but you can also say
146:43
to whistle and that is a verb
146:47
so whistle can be a noun whistle can
146:49
also be a verb if you use to whistle for
146:53
example can you whistle
146:57
can you whistle i am whistling but the
147:00
sound i'm making that is a whistle so
147:03
whistle can be noun or verb
147:06
10.
147:08
a loud warning sound we talked about
147:12
this a little bit before a loud warning
147:14
sound we talked about alarm but alarm
147:17
can also be
147:19
siren especially on a fire truck or a
147:22
police car we say the siren can you hear
147:26
the sirens the police are coming or the
147:29
fire truck is coming that's a siren we
147:32
can also call those alarm when a fire
147:36
truck goes to a fire if there are two
147:38
fire trucks we say it's a
147:41
two
147:43
alarm
147:46
fire
147:47
that means
147:48
two fire trucks came two alarm fire two
147:52
fire trucks came to put out the fire if
147:55
it's a five alarm fire what's a big fire
147:59
five fire trucks came okay so alarm and
148:02
siren very similar but usually we say
148:05
siren is on a vehicle it's the noise or
148:08
the the object that makes the noise
148:11
number 11
148:13
something that is asked right he has a
148:17
question this boy has a question raise
148:20
your arm if you have a question question
148:23
is something that is asked okay next one
148:28
opposite of forward
148:30
so this girl
148:32
she's kind of looking this way but she
148:34
could be looking behind her forward
148:37
pandero is very simple
148:39
back or you could also put back word
148:43
right
148:44
forward back or backward sometimes
148:48
people don't say ward they just say back
148:50
of course you can also say front front
148:53
back
148:54
frontward or forward
148:56
backward don't say frontward
148:58
forward or backwards usually forward
149:01
though is used for motion
149:03
he is walking forward
149:06
look forward backward walk backward
149:10
look
149:11
backward but if you're talking about for
149:14
example uh somebody's uh where somebody
149:17
thing is this is my front this is my
149:19
back so you could say both things right
149:22
look forward look to the front or this
149:25
is your front look back look backward or
149:28
this is my back okay so forward and back
149:33
13.
149:34
very interesting picture they're very
149:36
dressed up
149:37
softly softly means what it means gently
149:42
he is gently uh he's a gentleman so he's
149:45
acting very gently right
149:47
gently is softly not hard
149:50
for example if you're playing an
149:52
instrument like the drum before i said
149:54
to strike you hit something hard
149:56
you can play a drum
149:59
gently or softly making a little bit of
150:01
noise
150:03
playing it gently okay
150:07
okay oh here we have a dinosaur right
150:10
the part of the body between the head
150:12
and the shoulders here's the head here's
150:15
the shoulder so what is this part of the
150:18
body between the head and the shoulders
150:21
and of course on the dinosaur it's very
150:24
long also on a giraffe it's very long we
150:28
say it's the neck right the neck is the
150:30
part of the body between the head and
150:32
the shoulders on me on people the neck
150:36
is very short on dinosaurs some
150:38
dinosaurs and giraffes the neck is very
150:41
long
150:43
okay a long thin rope what is this rope
150:47
that this person is tying around their
150:50
finger we call that a string a string
150:54
you prob you might have strings in your
150:56
shoes
150:57
to close your shoes up you probably have
151:00
strings in your backpack right maybe you
151:02
have strings in your backpack to close
151:05
pockets strings are very useful
151:08
okay our last word
151:10
forward forward means
151:13
fourth okay now we use fourth by the way
151:16
that might be hard to pronounce
151:21
fourth
151:22
and then r right and th
151:25
fourth
151:26
fourth
151:27
okay
151:28
so what he's doing is his voice is
151:31
coming forth right uh his air is coming
151:34
forth his sound is coming forth from his
151:38
mouth so it's coming forward right it's
151:41
going forward from his mouth but when
151:43
you speak the sound is coming forth
151:47
from your mouth okay so that's
151:50
interesting that's a where you would
151:52
probably use that word
151:54
okay let's take a look at the exercises
151:57
the first exercise here complete each
151:59
sentence with a word from the box
152:02

159:33
okay so before we talk about the reading
159:35
passage though let's talk about some
159:37
words let's learn some vocabulary number
159:41
one
159:42
foolish now this man looks very foolish
159:45
right it's very foolish for a grown man
159:48

160:19
number two happy and energetic what can
160:22
we say about this woman right she looks
160:24
happy she looks energetic she looks
160:27
upbeat
160:29
upbeat
160:30
is happy or energetic if you say that i
160:34
feel upbeat today that means that you're
160:36
happy and you have lots of energy
160:39
okay next one
160:41
what's this guy doing
160:43
he's trying to look like something else
160:46
what is he trying to look like maybe an
160:48
ape
160:49
or maybe a monkey right so what is he
160:52
doing he's trying to look like something
160:54
else he's trying to be like something
160:57
else he is
160:58

161:01
imitate means to try and look like
161:05
something else you imitate like an
161:07
animal or you imitate another person
161:11
right so kids will do this a lot even
161:13
adults will do that we see something you
161:16
know maybe we're playing so we pretend
161:18
we're like a monkey or some other animal
161:20
we're imitating that or sometimes people
161:23
look at other people and say wow that
161:25
person's really cool that person is
161:27
really interesting i want to be like
161:30
that person so they will imitate that
161:33
other person so you can imitate animals
161:36
you can imitate people
161:38
okay next one
161:40
what's going on here
161:42
she's wearing jeans that fit her body
161:45
they're tight but these jeans are huge
161:47
they're very big so not tight there's a
161:50
special word for that we can say baggy
161:54
but baggy really refers to like a style
161:57
of fashion if this woman puts on these
162:01
jeans i would not say they're baggy i'd
162:04
say they're too big
162:05
they'll fall down right
162:07
baggy jeans would be okay on her waist
162:10
but they would be very wide on the legs
162:13
right and a baggy shirt is a shirt
162:15
that's too big and it's very loose on
162:17
her so baggy clothes it's a fashion
162:21
style we'll talk about that later but
162:24
baggy not tight very loose fitting
162:27
clothes very loose
162:31
fitting
162:34
loose fitting clothes are baggy clothes
162:37
so are your clothes tight or your
162:40
clothes loose are they baggy okay
162:43
next one
162:44
this is a good picture to show it's a
162:47
stage in a process of change this of
162:52
course is the moon and if we look at the
162:54
moon we know that the moon changes shape
162:58
in the sky there's different
163:00
uh stages we can say phase
163:04
what phase is the moon in we have the
163:06
full moon
163:08
right
163:09
full moon
163:11
whoops
163:12
full moon we have half moon
163:17
and although it's kind of weird to look
163:19
at it right this would be no moon
163:23
because we don't see that
163:24
right that's when the earth's light is
163:26
reflected in the moon it's kind of like
163:27
this one here right okay we don't see
163:30
the moon in the sky okay so full moon
163:32
half moon no moon those are the phases
163:35
of the moon and they change every month
163:38
don't they so depending on the month you
163:40
can see full moon half moon or no moon
163:43
uh
163:44
and that is the phase of the moon but
163:47
we're talking about the moon here but if
163:49
you think about it
163:50
many things go through a phase you go
163:53
through phases human beings go through
163:55
phases we have different stages
163:59
baby
164:00
child teenager young adult middle aged
164:04
adult and old person these are all
164:07
stages we all go through phases not just
164:10
people but all living things right
164:13
animals insects plants they all have
164:17
phases okay
164:19
okay next one
164:21

164:24
right she looks like she's in new york
164:26
it's raining she doesn't have an
164:29
umbrella be why because it's suddenly it
164:33
suddenly started to rain maybe she
164:36
didn't know
164:38
she didn't have any idea it was going to
164:39
rain so she didn't carry an umbrella now
164:42
it's suddenly raining she's getting wet
164:44
it's very very poor situation very sad
164:47

166:46
talks about what are you feeling these
166:49
days what

166:53
mood i'm in a bad mood depending on your
166:56
feeling
166:58
okay well what's going on here uh
167:00
informal words used by
167:03
particular people now this is kind of
167:05
funny because the word we're looking for
167:07
is slang but it doesn't just mean that
167:10
people who look like this guy use slang
167:13
everybody uses slang right and some
167:16
stage of their life right in some part
167:19
of their life everybody uses slang slang
167:22
is just really informal words
167:25
informal words like if i say um
167:29
hey hey brah hey dude right instead of
167:32
saying hello uh to a person a man i
167:35
don't call him a man i call him a dude
167:38
dude is more it's like slang hey dude
167:42
what's up how's it hanging right what's
167:45
hanging you know what's going on um that
167:47
would be slang okay maybe i'm getting
167:49
old i'm forgetting all my slang but
167:51
anyway slang is informal words words
167:54
that are not formal and we use slang
167:56
with your friends it's not proper to use
167:59
slang when you're at work or when you're
168:02
talking to your teacher or when you're
168:04
talking to your parents usually slang is
168:07
used among friends
168:09
okay next one
168:11
this is kind of funny is a cute little
168:13
kid right his his clothes are way too
168:16
big for him his shoes are really big not
168:19
tight
168:20
loose remember when we talked about
168:22
baggy
168:24
very similar right
168:26
baggy whoops
168:28
whoa whoa stop okay baggy baggy and
168:31
loose are very similar together right it
168:33
just means they're not tight it's not

168:46
looks actually like a model she's what
168:48
is she doing though this is a
168:50
an interesting looking dress isn't it
168:52
what is she doing she's wearing
168:54
this dress now be careful with wear okay
168:58
wear means that you have
169:01
something on your body it doesn't mean
169:03
that you put it on
169:05
right that's different if you say what
169:08
will you wear today that means what are
169:11
you wearing what are you wearing that
169:12
means what are you wearing now what is
169:14
on your body but in the morning you put
169:17
on clothes
169:20
put on clothes so you can say i will put
169:22
on a shirt right i will put on shoes and
169:25
then during the day you wear those
169:28
clothes okay so where where is an
169:31
irregular verb it changes
169:34
form for the past so we say where
169:38
war
169:39
worn wear war worn
169:42
okay next one
169:44
wow what are these guys doing here the
169:46
part of the body that bends in the
169:49
center of the leg so these people are
169:51
not standing right they're kind of on
169:54
their what on this part of the the leg
169:56
that bends in the middle we call that
169:59

170:01
guys doing here
170:03
they're not standing
170:05
on their feet they
170:06
are
170:08
kneeling to kneel that's interesting
170:11
this is a verb to kneel it's when you
170:14
stand on your knees right you get off
170:16
your feet and you're like this that is
170:18
to kneel and you can see it comes from
170:20
knee right because they're on their
170:23
knees so knee is the part of your leg
170:27
this part here and if you sit down and
170:30
are
170:31
just on your knees then you are kneeling
170:34
to kneel and you can see it comes from
170:36
that word knee interesting okay
170:40
of course you have one of this
170:42
in your book bag or in your room at home
170:45
i hope so
170:46
this is a book that tells you what words
170:50
mean of course you should have one in
170:53
your in in the korean language but maybe
170:55
you have a korean english one too that
170:58
says what words in korean what do they
171:00
mean or what word is it in english right
171:03
what is it it's of course a dictionary
171:07
dictionary
171:09
dictionary so it's actually four
171:12
four sounds dictionary
171:15
dictionary dictionary and that of course
171:17
is a book that tells you what words mean
171:20
if you want to know what a word means
171:22
you look it up
171:24
look
171:25
it
171:27
up
171:28
in
171:29
a
171:30
dictionary look it up in a dictionary
171:33
what does this word mean i don't know
171:35
look it up in a dictionary okay
171:39
whoa
171:42
cool guy right okay music in which words
171:46
are spoken fast
171:48
it's a type of music where people
171:51
say the words very fast and actually
171:53
it's kind of like poetry
171:56
but they're singing the words and they
171:59
sing them very quickly what is it you
172:01
know it's rap
172:03
rap is a musical style it's actually a
172:06
singing style where people sing the
172:08
words very quickly okay it's like
172:11
somebody you know it's not just like
172:12
reading a poem it's like reading a poem
172:14
to music into a beat and very quickly
172:17
and many of the words rhyme in other
172:19
words they sound similar
172:21
okay
172:22
last we have to imitate
172:25
this guy looks like johnny depp from
172:27
pirates of the caribbean right so he's
172:30
imitating johnny depp and we talked
172:33
about this to copy so remember we talked
172:35
about imitate before to act like
172:38
somebody else or to act like something
172:40
else we said that's to imitate but we
172:42
can also say it means also to copy so
172:45
you can copy the behavior of an animal
172:48
or you can copy the behavior or the
172:51
dress or the style of another person and
172:54
that is to copy
172:56
okay
172:57
let's talk about our all the vocabulary
173:00
exercises here we have synonyms remember
173:03
what a synonym means it means a word
173:06
that has a similar meaning to another
173:09
word a synonym
173:11
match the words in the box with their
173:14
synonyms listed below synonyms
173:17
same or similar meaning
173:20
okay so our words are
173:22
in the box
173:23
phase
173:24
imitate
173:26
suddenly
173:27
regret those are words
173:29
four words now we have to match these
173:32
words
173:33
to their synonyms and down here we have
173:36
copy
173:37
repent
173:38
abruptly
173:40
and stage
173:42
okay
173:42
so number one
173:44
copy well that's easy right because we
173:46
learned both of those words as part of
173:48
the vocabulary first we learned
173:50
one word and then we learned copy
173:52
remember i just talked about when you
173:55
copy something you're behaving very
173:57
similar to somebody else you are what
174:00
you are imitating them so copy and
174:03
imitate have similar meanings they're
174:05
very close to meaning they're the same
174:08
thing okay to copy to is to imitate now
174:12
number two is a little hinduro
174:14
because
174:15
repent we didn't learn that word repent
174:18
so look it up in your dictionary
174:20
if you do you will find out that it
174:23
means something here i will i will
174:24
define what repent means repent
174:27
is something let's say you do something
174:30
and you feel sorry about what you did so
174:32
you repent you say oh i wish i didn't do
174:35
that i'm really sorry i'm sorry i did
174:38
that so if you are sorry about something
174:41
you did if you are sorry about your
174:44
actions what word means that ah here
174:47
regret you regret what you did repent is
174:51
regret
174:53
okay next one three abruptly again
174:56
abruptly means something happens and
174:59
it's not expected something happens
175:02
quickly you don't expect it so what word
175:05
did we learn that means something
175:07
happens unexpectedly it of course means
175:11
suddenly suddenly abruptly and suddenly
175:14
are the same meaning
175:17
here we have stage
175:19
okay now we learned the word stage and
175:22
part of the definition for stage
175:25
was
175:26
this other word they use this other word
175:27
and the other word of course was phase
175:29
and i talked about phases of the moon
175:32
actually this was the word we learned
175:33
right and stage was in the definition so
175:36
we talked about the moon there are
175:38
different stages or phases of the moon
175:43
and they're also when we talk about
175:44
people or any living thing all living
175:47
things go through different stages
175:51
okay
175:52
that's synonyms what about
175:54
antonyms
175:56
antonym means the opposite so synonym
176:00
means the same antonym is opposite
176:03
pandero right so match the words in the
176:07
box with their antonyms opposite
176:10
meanings
176:11
listed below
176:12
the words that we studied are ridiculous
176:16
ridiculous
176:17
mellow
176:19
upbeat
176:20
and baggy okay i didn't repeat all those
176:23
but ridiculous mellow upbeat
176:26
and baggy these are the words that are
176:29
the antonyms of the words in the box
176:32
number one we have violent
176:36
violent
176:38
is something that is uh of course very
176:42
aggressive very angry
176:44
and really you know or bad so somebody
176:48
who is violent is the opposite of what
176:51
opposite pandero what is the opposite of
176:54
violent here the opposite of violent
176:56
would be
176:58
mello remember mello means calm and
177:00
gentle
177:02
gentle is the opposite of violent so you
177:05
can have a violent person or you can
177:07
have a gentle person they are opposites
177:11
two
177:12
sad
177:13
what is the opposite of sad what word
177:15
did we look at that we learn that is the
177:17
opposite of sad which word up here means
177:20
happy and energetic
177:23
that word of course is upbeat and of
177:25
course that would be the opposite of sad
177:28
somebody who's sad is not happy they're
177:30
not energetic right they're just sad
177:33
okay three
177:34
sensible now we didn't learn that word
177:37
okay but we're looking for the opposite
177:39
of sensible what does sensible mean if
177:42
we look it up in the dictionary you will
177:44
see that sensible means acting in a
177:48
a normal ordinary way or using common
177:52
sense right in other words acting in the
177:55
proper way if you see a man in a
177:58
business suit who is being very polite
178:01
to other people he's being sensible but
178:04
if you see a man in the business suit
178:06
riding a little tricycle right that's
178:09
not sensible that's very silly that's
178:12
what it's ridiculous it's ridiculous so
178:15
sensible and ridiculous are opposites
178:18
antonyms
178:20
number four is tight
178:22
that's very easy we we looked at that as
178:25
part of the definition for one of the
178:27
words we saw the woman wearing
178:29
tight jeans and she was holding some
178:32
very big genes that would be what they
178:34
would be
178:35
baggy on her so tight and baggy are
178:39
opposites or antonyms okay so that's a
178:42
review of these words here now that you
178:44
have a good idea of what these words
178:46
mean we'll see them in the reading
178:48
passage let's go over that in just a few
178:51
moments
178:52

no no good right okay so let's get
180:24
started with the uh with the lesson but
180:26
before we do that
180:28
to give you an idea of what the
180:31
philharmonic is we can take a look at
180:33
this video here
180:36
this video shows an orchestra that's one
180:40
of the words we'll learn in the
180:41
vocabulary orchestra and orchestra as
180:45
you can see are many many musicians
180:48
playing together there's different
180:51
sections here we have violins right over
180:55
here we have the chalu right over in the
180:59
back you have people playing trumpets or
181:02
different kinds of horns you also have
181:04
the drummers they're all in different
181:07
places in the orchestra and of course
181:10
you have the audience outside and at the
181:13
end if the orchestra is good they will
181:16
say bravo bravo encore right they will
181:20
show their appreciation they will say
181:23
wow that was a good
181:26
uh musical performance okay so that's
181:29
what we're talking about here this type
181:31
of orchestra let's begin with the words
181:34
are you ready let's go
181:36
okay number one word number one
181:39
the person who leads a musical group in
181:43
the video maybe it's a little hard to
181:45
see but there was one man standing in
181:48
front of all of the musicians and
181:52
usually he has a stick right and he
181:54
waves it like this okay what do we call
181:57
that person he's the leader of the
182:01
musical group we call him the conductor
182:04
conductor
182:07
conductor
182:08
he is
182:09
the leader of an orchestra he leads the
182:13
musicians right so he tells them when to
182:16
play or you know how fast to play and
182:18
he's always doing this he doesn't make
182:20
any music right he's just telling the
182:23
other musicians
182:25
how to play okay and he's like the
182:27
leader he makes sure they sound good
182:30
okay so that's the conductor
182:32
next we have a public performance of
182:35
music
182:36
so before we saw the video there were
182:39
many musicians right so many but look at
182:42
this picture there's only one two three
182:44
and maybe a number four there's a guy
182:46
behind there this would just be a band
182:49
not an orchestra but a band an orchestra
182:52
sometimes there's just one person a
182:54
singer right but it's any any public
182:58
performance of music
183:00
any time
183:01
that somebody plays music for the public
183:05
and there's an audience what do we call

what word can we use perform
187:42
to perform now look this is a verb
187:47
to
187:48

187:52
noun and we can say performance
187:57
okay
187:59
if we add a and c and we don't say two
188:01
we say
188:02
a
188:03
performance
188:05
that
188:06
then
188:07
becomes
188:08
a noun this is a noun because it is when
188:13
people get together and they play music
188:16
or they do something

part of the orchestra we call them the
189:03
audience the audience but this is the
189:06
important thing
189:08
the audience is all of these people
189:12

189:14
you cannot say he is an audience
189:18

190:15
group of people when we talk about
190:18
audience we're talking about the whole
190:20
group of people if you want to say one
190:23

190:25
say audience member or audience members
190:29
okay please be careful i hear a lot of
190:32
mistakes with that okay next one
190:36
a thin stick used to direct a musical
190:39
group i talked about this guy before
190:41
remember him he is a conductor but i
190:44
said he has a stick that he waves in
190:48
front of the audience like you go you
190:50
guys play okay you guys right and he'll
190:53
use that stick
190:54
to show the rhythm
190:56
or how people should play the music
190:58
right he uses stick what is the stick
191:01
called it's called a baton
191:04
baton a baton so the conductor
191:08
uses a baton when he conducts in an
191:14
orchestra a baton
191:16
okay next word
191:18
a person who performs and writes music
191:22
so if this boy can play the guitar but
191:25
he can also write the music some people
191:28
just play music somebody else wrote it
191:31
they read it on a paper and they play it
191:34
but if somebody who performs and writes
191:37
music what do we call them we call them
191:40
a musician okay now of course you they
191:43
don't just also have to write music many
191:46
musicians also just perform okay
191:50
somebody who performs music we can say a
191:53
musician somebody who writes music is a
191:56
composer
191:59
okay so but somebody who performs and
192:02
writes together we can say of course
192:05
they are a musician okay next one
192:09
a large number of people so a large
192:13
number of people what do we call that of
192:15
course we call that a crowd when there's
192:18
many many many people right so do you
192:21
say
192:24
or is that right okay that's many many
192:27
people together you can say it's a crowd
192:29
so if you go to a baseball game or a
192:32
soccer game the people the audience in
192:35
the stands that is a crowd of people
192:38
many people okay
192:42
next one to guide or control we say to
192:47
lead to guide or control something
192:51
we say is to lead maybe he is leading
192:55
his team
192:57
so to lead lead is an irregular verb so
193:01
it changes form in the past tense let's
193:04
see it goes lead lead lead
193:08
so when we talk when we use this verb in
193:10
the past we use lead lead lead
193:14
lead lead lead okay next one we're
193:17
talking about to make something happen
193:20
in a certain way to make something
193:23
happen in a certain way and we can see a
193:25
calendar here a calendar with many dates
193:29
on it and somebody's marked
193:31
the 14th and they did it with a love
193:35
sign right somewhere what is that that
193:37
looks to me like it's february
193:40
14th right i don't know but i'm guessing
193:44
because february 14th is
193:47
valentine's day
193:49
valentine's day so i think
193:52
this calendar is of february and 14th is
193:56
marked with a heart because it's
193:57
valentine's day when boyfriends and
194:00
girlfriends say i love you to each other
194:02
right but anyway so what are they doing
194:04
they're making something happen in a
194:07
certain way they are saying that on the
194:09
14th we're gonna have valentine's day
194:12
we're gonna have maybe a party or we're
194:14
gonna have a date or we're gonna do
194:16
something special for that day what are
194:19
they doing they are setting that day or
194:22
they are setting a uh something an event
194:25
that will happen in a certain way so to
194:28
set set is an irregular verb it doesn't
194:32
change form in the past set set set is
194:36
the verb next one a large room for
194:40
meetings or concerts so it's a large
194:43
room where people can have meetings they
194:46
can have concerts what do we call that
194:48
room that room is called a hall and many
194:52
times you can see the word music hall
194:56
concert
194:57
hall those words usually go together
195:01
okay so a hall can be a large room
195:05
where a performance
195:07
or a meeting is held
195:10
okay next one
195:11
wow look at that
195:13
many many lights to become full in this
195:15
case full of lights we can say to fill
195:18
these lights
195:20
fill the space
195:22
if that's the sky stars fill the sky
195:26
right so if you uh or if you there are
195:29
many people a crowd of people will fill
195:33
the hall they make it full there's no
195:35
more room okay
195:38
next one to move slowly on water or in
195:41
the air look at this balloon it's a big
195:44
balloon or ball filled with air right it
195:49
stays on the top of the water if we put
195:52
helium right some gas in this ball and
195:56
let it go maybe it will go up in the air
195:59
what do we say it is floating
196:02
so something can float on the surface of
196:05
the water but if something flies just in
196:08
the air you know it doesn't have any uh
196:10
control it just kind of floats in the
196:13
air like soap bubbles
196:15
you blow in all the little bubbles they
196:17
float away in the air and clouds clouds
196:20
will float in the air some balloons will
196:23
float so to float to move slowly on
196:26
water or in the air
196:29
okay
196:30
those are our words lots of words to
196:32
remember right
196:34
let's see how well you remember
196:37
what those words mean here we have
196:39
exercise one
196:41
our job is to complete each sentence
196:44
with a word from the box
196:47
so we have sentences here we'll have
196:49
eight sentences
196:51
we have a blank in each sentence we need
196:54
to fill those blanks with these words
196:58
let's review the words first we have
197:01
conductor
197:03
conductor
197:05

197:18
historic
197:19
next one
197:21
performed
197:23
performed now notice that performed
197:26
past tense right because our root is
197:29
here our basic word is here perform but
197:32
it's past tense we use performed okay
197:36
next one
197:37
audience
197:39
audience
197:41
next one is
197:42
concert
197:44
concert and finally we have
197:47

an audience
198:17
with music what do we call that it's a
198:20
noun right we say
198:22
it's a concert right the pianist's first
198:25
concert was held last year because here
198:29
we're looking for
198:30
it's like a performance concert and
198:32
performance are the same but don't get
198:34
confused because performed here is a
198:36
verb it's not performance right concert
198:39
is the word we're looking for that is a
198:41
noun to talk about the performance or
198:44
the uh event that a musician plays to
198:47
entertain people okay number two
198:50
the only musical beep i can play

199:18
instrument the only musical instrument i
199:21

199:25

199:27
a musical instrument say no i can't play
199:32
any musical instrument or
199:34
the only
199:35
instrument i can play is the piano or
199:39
the guitar or the flute or whatever most
199:42
people can play a drum right maybe not
199:45
well but you can play the drum okay next
199:47
one number three
199:50
i wanted to beep the room but the door
199:53
was locked well think about that you
199:55
want to do something with the room
199:58
you obviously want to maybe go inside
200:01
the room but you can't because the door
200:03
is locked if the door is locked you
200:05
cannot go into the room go into what
200:09
word means to go into
200:12
a place what word here
200:14
ah you're probably looking for this one
200:16
right here right enter i wanted to enter
200:19
the room but the door was locked you
200:23
can't enter when the door is locked okay
200:26
next one number four
200:28
last night she peep a concerto on the
200:32
piano a concerto by the way is a type of
200:36
performance okay so uh it's a type of
200:41
musical piece that people will play and
200:43
she did it on the piano so when somebody
200:46
plays music
200:48
another word for that verb right and she
200:51
did it last night so it's in the past
200:54
tense right what do we say what verb
200:57
means to play
201:00
uh some type of performance right like a
201:04
concert or a performance if you do that
201:07
you're performing last night she
201:09
performed
201:10
a concerto on the piano okay so she
201:14
performed she performed a concert or in
201:18
this case a concerto
201:20
a performance on the piano but if you
201:22
say she performed a performance
201:25
that sounds a little weird it's okay but
201:27
perform performance too similar so we
201:30
say concert or something else okay
201:33
number five all the people watch the
201:36
beep event on television the what event
201:40
what kind of event
201:42
on television and all the people watched
201:45
it so it was very important right it was
201:48
very important what kind of event can
201:50
you watch on television a conductor
201:52
event that doesn't make sense an
201:54
orchestra event that's weird what about
201:57
a historic event ah all the people watch
202:00
the historic event on television that
202:04
makes sense that's correct okay so if
202:07
it's a historical event it's very
202:09
important in history many people will
202:12
watch it
202:13
six he is the beep of this musical group
202:18
so we need one person right
202:21
a word that describes a person in a
202:24
musical group remember one type of
202:26
musical group is an orchestra
202:29
well what is one person in an orchestra
202:32
one person an audience no
202:34
an audience is a group of people right
202:37
so it's not audience
202:40
can it be
202:41
conductor
202:43
he is the conductor of this musical
202:46
group that's the only word there that
202:48
describes one person of a musical group
202:51
and remember audience is not part
202:53
it's not part of the musical group and
202:56
also remember audience is a group of
202:58
people not one person we can't say he is
203:00
the audience that doesn't make sense
203:02
okay unless the audience is only one
203:04
person right only one person watching
203:06
that would make sense but of this
203:08
musical group well actually that could
203:10
that could be a possible but in this
203:13
case we're looking for conductor okay
203:15
next one
203:16
seven
203:17
there was a large beep in the music hall
203:20
there was a large what in the music hall
203:23
what are we looking for
203:24
we're probably looking for
203:27
how many people came to see the concert
203:31
so there was a large think about a if
203:33
there was a crowd of people many people
203:36
came to see the concert and they
203:39
gathered in the music hall many people
203:41
who watch a musical performance we call
203:45
them of course the audience there was a
203:47
large audience in the music hall so
203:51
audience is better for this sentence
203:53
here
203:54
eight
203:55
a full-size beep is called a
203:58
philharmonic so there we have a little
204:01
bit
204:02
of answer as to what philharmonic means
204:05
right we're talking about the new york
204:07

204:09
what is it it's an orchestra but it's a
204:12
full-size orchestra that means that an
204:15
orchestra with all the different
204:17
instruments all the many people
204:19
who play those different instruments if
204:22

204:24
playing certain instruments we call that
204:26

204:29
of orchestra okay let's uh stop there of

construction worker but you can also say
215:46
office worker right office worker you

215:55
very easy word okay
215:57
next one to give something in exchange

to give it away they're going to
216:16
what they're going to
216:18
sell their house right they're going to
216:20
sell their house and look at the word
216:22
the the word in the picture here sold
216:25
cell is an irregular verb so we say sell
216:29
sold sold because it's passed they sold
216:32
the house they exchanged the house for
216:35
money they didn't give away the house
216:38
right they want money in return for the
216:40
house have you ever sold something maybe
216:44
you had a like an old doll or an old toy
216:48
that you don't want anymore but you
216:51
don't want to throw it away maybe you
216:53
could sell it to a friend or maybe a
216:55
book or a video game that you you're
216:58
finished with you don't want it anymore
217:00
you might sell it to somebody else so
217:02
you exchange it
217:04
for money okay next one
217:08
what's this this is a machine that sucks
217:12
sucks
217:13
dirt and air off the floor so it's
217:17
right it sucks it up what do we call
217:19
this we call it a whoa that's a big word
217:22
vacuum
217:24
cleaner
217:25
vacuum cleaner okay you know this
217:28
machine right maybe you're playing your
217:30
game and your mom starts using the
217:33
vacuum cleaner like mom it's too noisy
217:35
right it drives you crazy but hey mom
217:38
has to clean right maybe you should use
217:41
the vacuum cleaner help mom out right so
217:44
that's good so don't complain if the
217:46
vacuum cleaner you hear the vacuum
217:48
cleaner and you're trying to do
217:49
something because you want to have a
217:51
clean house you don't want dirt all over
217:54
the floor dirt and dust and if you have
217:57
a dog little hair all over the floor you
217:59
want to be able to suck that air up with
218:02
a vacuum cleaner by the way the vacuum
218:05
cleaner is another machine right so it's
218:09
another example of many machines that
218:12
make our lives easier it does the work
218:15
for us it's very easy to use a vacuum
218:17
cleaner instead of a broom right broom
218:20
is
218:21
dirty and difficult to use vacuum
218:24
cleaner is much easier yes it's noisy
218:27
but it's easier okay next one
218:31
to control a car now actually the word
218:34
is in this picture right if the the word
218:36
is drive and we can see that word right
218:38
here drive right but this word is driver
218:42
so of course in english many verbs we
218:46
can change to noun and we can say the
218:48
person who does it right before we saw
218:51
work er
218:53
if we just use work that's a verb worker
218:56
is a person
218:57
drive is a verb driver is a person she
219:02
will be a driver she is learning she is
219:05
a student driver so she is learning to
219:09
drive to drive is to control a car it's
219:12
also an irregular verb so it changes
219:15
form for the past tense we say drive
219:19
drove
219:20
driven drive drove driven
219:24
okay so that is to control a car it's to
219:27
drive a car can you drive a car probably
219:30
not yet but don't try it's dangerous
219:33
right it's hazardous but when you're
219:35
older you can learn how to drive a car
219:38
but be careful always it's a dangerous
219:40
machine it's a hazardous machine be
219:43
careful be safe and you'll be okay okay
219:47
a very large sea so if you can see water
219:51
water all around for as far as you can
219:53
see and maybe it takes you days to sail
219:57
across that sea we call that an ocean
220:00
right there are only a few
220:03
big oceans in the world right there are
220:06
only a few and they're very big like a
220:07
pacific ocean the atlantic ocean the
220:10
indian ocean right we call those really
220:13
big areas of water we call them an ocean
220:16
smaller areas are called seas like the
220:19
mediterranean sea the caribbean sea
220:23
right those are smaller areas of water
220:26
next one a short time to rest before we
220:29
talked about workers right workers are
220:32
people who do work well they can't work
220:34
all the time right we need to take a
220:36
break we need to drink something or to
220:38

220:41
that case we need to take a break take a
220:45
break right
220:47
take
220:50
a break so we usually use it in this
220:52
expression let's take a break do you
220:56
want to take a break hey everybody it's
221:00
time to take a break so take a break
221:03
means to stop working and to rest for a
221:06
little bit okay
221:08
next one wow
221:10

221:21
perfect it's perfect no mistakes it's
221:25
perfect it is perfect so that is a
221:29
perfect shot in this case we would say
221:31
it's a perfect shot perfect right on
221:36
the middle a dot it's perfect
221:39
okay let's go over our vocabulary
221:42
exercises now how well do you remember
221:45
the words we just studied what we're
221:48
going to do here is we have many
221:50
sentences we need to choose the word
221:54
that best fits in the blanks in these
221:58
sentences
221:59
so these are our words here we have
222:02
eight words let's review those before we
222:05
look at the exercises the first word is
222:08
error
222:09
error
222:10
okay next is
222:12
owner
222:13
owner
222:14
the next one is
222:16
machine
222:17
machine
222:19
the next one is
222:20
clue
222:22
clue
222:23
the next one
222:25

222:26
they
222:27
vacation vacation okay
222:31
complex
222:32
complex
222:34
next one
222:36
hazardous
222:38
hazardous hazardous
222:40
next one is
222:42
direct
222:43
direct
222:45
okay let's take a look at these
222:47
sentences and figure out which word
222:50
belongs in those blanks okay number one
222:53
the peep
222:55
of this tall building is very rich
222:58
okay so usually people are rich and
223:02
think about it if someone
223:04
has a tall building if someone has a
223:08
tall building a tall building wow that's
223:11
a lot of money that person is very rich
223:14
so what do we call a person who has
223:17
something whether it's a tall building
223:20
or just a small pencil we call that
223:23
person the owner the owner by the way we
223:27
use the because there's only one
223:30
there's only one owner of the building
223:32
okay the owner of the building right if
223:35
there's a pencil somebody owns that
223:37
pencil who is that person that's only
223:39
one person so we don't say a owner of
223:42
the pencil that's weird because a means
223:44
one of many but there's only one owner
223:47
of this particular pencil so we say the
223:50
owner of this pencil if only one person
223:52
owns the building then it's the owner of
223:55
the building now it's true many people
223:58
can own a building that's true and we
224:00
could say one of the owners of this
224:02
building but in this case we're talking
224:04
about the owner that means there's only
224:06
one person so usually we use the with
224:09
owner because usually there's only one
224:11
person who owns something okay
224:14
if there are many people who own the
224:16
building then we can say one of the
224:18
owners but in this case there's just one
224:20
person he's very rich wow okay two
224:25
you should push
224:27
push this button to turn on this what
224:31
what do you turn on by pushing a button
224:34
what thing here is turned on by pushing
224:38
a button usually when you push a button
224:41
it
224:42
makes electricity go to a certain thing
224:45
it's probably a thing that uses
224:47
electricity to do people's work so what
224:50
do we call that thing we call that thing
224:52
a machine right a machine usually you
224:55
push a button and it turns on think
224:57
about your computer your computer is a
225:00
machine you push a button it turns on
225:03
your vacuum cleaner is a machine usually
225:06
you can push a button on the vacuum
225:08
cleaner sometimes they have a switch but
225:10
it's a switch or a button you push it
225:13
and it turns on okay
225:15
okay so that's a machine number three i

if a place is hazardous then you
230:17

okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
230:35
section of this lesson let's take a
230:36
short break we'll come back and do the
230:38
reading
230:40
[Music]
230:54
hello everybody welcome back to reading
230:56
for vocabulary i'm brian stewart well
230:59
we're continuing on our theme of robots
231:02
and have you ever wondered about where
231:05
robots came from well in this lesson
231:07
we're going to find out because we're
231:09
going to talk about early robots we're
231:12
going to learn about the history of
231:15
robots where did robots come from
231:18
what kind of robots were the first
231:20
robots well let's take a look at a
231:23
picture first and we can see a lot of
231:26
different
231:27
examples of early robots you know the
231:30
first robots that came out right it
231:33
looks like
231:34
this machine this is all the robot yes
231:36
because it all controlled this little
231:38
robot bird up here on the top right look
231:40
at how ugly that is and all that
231:43
machinery just for this tiny little
231:45
robot at the top right and of course
231:48
robots have been famous in uh storybooks
231:52
and cartoon books uh like this here uh
231:55
there's been different types of robots
231:57
of course early robots used in factories
232:00
for lifting things up uh different
232:03
different things i'm not really sure
232:04
what this is
232:06
now this is not a robot this is a person
232:09
it's a person an astronaut on the moon
232:11
but the the people who went to the moon
232:14
the astronauts on the moon in the 1960s
232:18
used robots to help them get around on
232:21
the moon and also to help them guide
232:23
their spacecraft and build the
232:25
spacecraft to the moon without robots
232:27
people would not have been able to go to
232:29
the moon
232:31
here we can see some early robot legs
232:34
right a little robot play dogs i think
232:36
this is called ibo right the little
232:38
japanese are robot dogs that were very
232:41
popular
232:43
a few years ago and of course maybe you
232:45
have one of these in your home this is
232:47
an example of a robot vacuum cleaner
232:50
that goes around and cleans up the um
232:53
the dust and the dirt in your home okay
232:56
so these are all examples of early
232:58
robots this is not so early but it's
233:01
still kind of a simple robot so these
233:04
pictures all show different stages in
233:06
the history of robots
233:09
okay we have our first word here and it
233:11
looks like she's having fun right she's
233:14
going around and around she's to turn
233:16
around on a center and what is she on by
233:20
the way she's on a merry
233:24
go
233:26
round she's on a merry-go-round that's
233:28
what we call this uh
233:31
play
233:32
toy
233:33
at a playground it's a merry-go-round
233:35
and what is she doing the merry-go-round
233:37
just turns around on a center so what is
233:40
it doing it is rotating to just turn
233:42
around and around and there's a center
233:44
right so you have the center and you're
233:46
turning around on the center you're just
233:48
rotating to rotate around the earth
233:52
rotates around on its center right so um
233:56
to rotate is just to turn around around
233:58
like on a merry-go-round actually when
234:01
you think about it on the earth we're
234:03
all on a very big merry-go-round aren't
234:06
we but we don't feel it
234:08
okay next one
234:09
uh the foot of an animal
234:12
oh this is kind of cute right do you
234:13
have a dog right sometimes you can say
234:15
okay hello hello and the dog will shake
234:18
hands with you it's a trick right so
234:20
when you do that you take the dog's what
234:23
the foot of an animal we we don't really
234:25
call it a foot there's a special word
234:27
for it for animals not for people but
234:29
for animals we call it a paw
234:32
a paw dogs have a paw
234:35
bears have a paw lions have a paw but be
234:39
careful of the lions paw they're very
234:41
dangerous right but dog's paws are cute
234:44
right you can hold them say hello doggy
234:46
right
234:47
you can train your dog to shake hands
234:50
or shake paws okay next one
234:54
oh who's this guy uh he looks maybe you
234:56
don't know who he is okay it's getting a
234:59
little bit old now but uh he is
235:02
imitating a famous speaker he
235:06
is imitating elvis presley if you don't
235:10
know who that is
235:11
ask your mom or dad they'll know he's a
235:14
famous singer an amer famous american
235:16
singer elvis presley uh he's a very deep
235:20
voice like
235:21
you know he sings kind of like that okay
235:24
but elvis presley to imitate what's
235:26
another word for that to
235:28
mimic
235:29
to mimic
235:31
is to copy or imitate somebody imitate
235:34
also means to copy but a copy is like
235:38
you know if you're going to copy
235:39
something you copy a book on a machine
235:42
but if you're going to behave or dress
235:46
or act in the same way as somebody else
235:49
it's better to use mimic instead of copy
235:52
right if you mimic somebody mimic is
235:55
specifically for a person who is copying
235:59
the actions or behavior of another
236:03
person that is mimic so when you copy or
236:06
behave the actions of another person you
236:10
are imitating them okay you are
236:14
mimicking them to mimic somebody okay
236:17
next one
236:18
a wheel with teeth so these are wheels
236:21
right but they have teeth not teeth that
236:23
are going to bite you right but teeth
236:25
that catch onto other teeth and turn
236:28
them around and these things like you
236:31
turn this one it will turn that one and
236:33
it will turn that one and you can find
236:35
these things in many machines this is
236:38
how many machines are able to do work
236:41
with
236:42
these gears with a gear in fact in your
236:46
car you have different gears different
236:48
speeds on your bicycle you have
236:50
different gears right you can change the
236:53
gear on a fancy bicycle so if you're
236:56
going up a hill or down a hill you can
236:59
change the gear to go faster or to have
237:01
more power when you pedal it so gears
237:05
are very important for many different
237:07
machines they're just basically wheels
237:10
with teeth on them
237:13
okay to lift something up to lift
237:16
something up what are they doing they
237:18

237:21
parts of a
237:22

237:47
a bird with a heavy body and short legs
237:50
you see these birds everywhere
237:52
especially in the city right they're
237:53
going
237:54

238:00
ground and they go
238:02

238:05
pigeons but they're kind of dirty birds
238:07
right don't touch them you know maybe
238:09
you can throw them food but you know
238:11
don't chase them don't try to touch them
238:13
because that that's not good for your
238:15

238:17
pigeons and unfortunately they go hua
238:20
jiung chill everywhere right they go to
238:22
the bathroom all over the place and it's
238:24
little white uh
238:26
places on the ground so they are pigeons
238:28
hopefully they don't fly over you oh no
238:30
that's terrible right but pigeons are
238:32
everywhere okay
238:35
what in the world is this guy doing
238:38
important and respected the word is
238:42
impressive now
238:44
maybe that's up to your opinion
238:48
okay if i look at this guy i don't think
238:51
impressive i think silly or foolish okay
238:55
but let's say there's an important
238:58
politician or uh important person gives
239:01
a speech let's say we're talking about
239:02
like for example martin luther king do
239:05
you know who that is
239:06
martin luther king was a very important
239:10
leader in america
239:12
uh history in the civil rights movement
239:15
he was a black preacher who spoke for uh
239:19
equal rights for black people and white
239:21
people in fact people of all races and
239:24
all ages and all sexes and he was a very
239:28
impressive speaker he was important many
239:31
people respected him he was impressive
239:35
okay
239:36
usually some politicians are impressive
239:39
unfortunately not all politicians are
239:41
impressive actors can be impressive if
239:44
you wow that that person really is a
239:46
good actor then you respect that person
239:48
they are impressive okay if you're an
239:52
artist maybe you think that's impressive
239:54
other people might think it's kind of
239:56
silly but you know it's a matter of
239:58
opinion really okay so impressive is
240:01
important and respected
240:03
next one
240:05
of the present time
240:07
of the present time
240:09
in this case they're talking about the
240:11
style the style is a reflection or it
240:15
shows the present time it is
240:18
modern style of course you know you can
240:20
talk about old-fashioned style when you
240:22
go into houses or buildings you look at
240:25
the the decorations you can say oh this
240:27
is old-fashioned or some of them they
240:30
might look very modern very clean very
240:33
simple uh modern style okay so modern it
240:36
just means of the present time but
240:39
modern doesn't just mean be careful it
240:41
doesn't just mean the decoration on the
240:43
inside of a building it can also mean
240:45
the way that people are thinking oh
240:47
that's modern thinking or it's modern
240:50
behavior or it's a modern machinery or
240:54
it's a modern movie so modern just means
240:57
of the present time it's an adjective
241:00
used to describe many different things
241:04
next one a type of tall plant with white
241:07
or colored flowers and it looks like
241:09
this do you know what type of flower
241:11
this is this flower is called a lily
241:15
lily
241:16
my wife her favorite flower is the
241:19
purple lily so i have to remember that
241:21
otherwise i get in trouble if i forget
241:23
right but anyway lily is a very
241:26
beautiful and impressive flower so you
241:29
could say wow uh a lily can be an
241:32
impressive flower because it's very
241:34
beautiful okay
241:37
a person who makes and repairs oops
241:40
that's a little mistake there we'll just
241:41
check that out a person who makes and
241:44
repairs clocks so this person
241:47
when they're
241:48
making a clock or they're repairing a
241:50
clock we call them a clock maker that's
241:53
very simple right
241:55
makes
241:56
clocks clock maker how simple is that
241:59
we're just putting two words together to
242:02
make one word clock
242:05
maker clockmaker you can also say watch
242:09
maker people who make watches be careful
242:12
oh that's a good thing this is not a
242:14
clock
242:15
do not say that this is a clock this is
242:17
not a clock that's konglish okay this is
242:20
a watch okay so watch
242:25
a clock is on the wall right if you have
242:28
a clock on the wall that's a clock this
242:31
is a watch don't say i have a clock on
242:34
my wrist what that's a big clock on your
242:36
wrist that's very heavy it's very
242:38
strange how do you put on your shirt
242:40
it's crazy right so don't put a clock on
242:42
your wrist put a watch on your wrist but
242:44
we can say watch maker or clock maker
242:49
kind of the same thing they do the same
242:50
things really and they can probably do
242:52
both right so you say he's a clock maker
242:54
or he's a watchmaker okay so clockmaker
242:57
or watchmaker but remember the
242:59
difference between clock and watch
243:01
they're not the same
243:03
okay
243:04
whoa what happened here this guy looks
243:06
very
243:07
uh
243:07
what is he looks very surprised
243:10
something that is not expected is
243:13
surprising now be careful here do not
243:16
say he is surprising that's not right
243:19
he
243:20
is
243:22
sur
243:27
right be careful he is not surprising
243:30
don't use ing to describe him use ed to
243:34
describe him he is surprised the message
243:39
the message is surprising okay so we use
243:43
surprising to describe the thing that
243:46
makes him
243:48
surprised
243:49
okay
243:50
and we do that with all sorts of
243:52
adjectives like that for example let's
243:54
take another one a boring
243:58
do you say i am boring no i say the book
244:03
is boring it makes me bored i am bored
244:07
the book that i'm reading it's boring so
244:10
if i read a book it's boring it makes me
244:14
bored don't say he is boring or i am
244:17
boring because if you do that what
244:20
you're saying is that i am boring i make
244:22
other people bored
244:24
right don't say i am boring right uh say
244:28
i am bored okay he is surprised not
244:31
surprising he is surprised because the
244:35
message is surprising
244:38
okay so the thing that makes somebody
244:41
feel a certain way is ing
244:44
the person's reaction is edie it's a
244:47
good way to remember okay the person's
244:49
reaction is ed the thing that causes
244:52
that is ing okay cause is ing reaction
244:57
is ed okay so boring board surprising
245:02
surprised confusing confused please
245:05
don't make a mistake now notes that's a
245:08
very common mistake okay the next word
245:10
here is unusual so something may have
245:13
pushed this boy down but it's something
245:15
unusual means it's not common not
245:18
ordinary
245:20
not some maybe something that's not
245:23
usual that doesn't normally happen so
245:26
another word for unusual is strange but
245:29

negative positive it's just unusual it's
245:38
just not ordinary but strange has a
245:42
little bit of a negative meaning you say
245:45
if you say that's strange you may have a
245:48

but it's also doing this around the sun
255:06
what is it doing it is of course it is
255:11
rotating the earth rotates around the
255:14
sun so you could say the earth also
255:16
rotates because it moves around the
255:18
center the center is the sun the earth
255:20
is moving around the center so it's
255:22

257:52
let's take a look though at the
257:53

257:59
a very difficult picture what is all

maybe you're a genius in one area or
258:38
another okay so the a person who's very
258:41

258:44

258:45
next one
258:46
far away so if that city is really far
258:49
away we can say it is distant
258:52
distant uh if you see mountains very far
258:56
away those mountains are distant distant
258:59
far away
259:01
okay next one
259:02
to change into something else
259:05
okay so a long time ago this was all
259:09
rock but water and wind came through and
259:12
changed these rocks into very
259:14
interesting shapes what happened they
259:18
transformed
259:19
transform
259:22
trans of course is a cross and form is
259:25
shaped so across different shapes
259:28
transform this is a verb to change to
259:32
change into something else remember the
259:34
movie uh poster we saw at the beginning
259:38
transformers of course those are about
259:40
robots that can change their shape
259:43
into something else and we'll read about
259:46
that in the passage
259:49
whoa there's a funny guy right he's a
259:51
funny looking guy
259:53
maybe he wants to hide himself to hide
259:56
yourself by looking different right he
259:58
doesn't look like that he doesn't have
260:00
such big eyebrows he doesn't have a big
260:02
nose or a mustache but he put it on
260:05
maybe he wants to hide who he really is
260:08
so what is he doing he is disguising
260:12
to disguise yourself right also disguise
260:17
can be a noun also right but here it is
260:21
a verb in this definition
260:25
to hide that is a verb but it can also
260:28
be a noun the glasses with the big nose
260:31
and the mustache that is a disguise so
260:34
you put on a disguise you can put on
260:39
put on
260:40
a
260:41
disguise so you can use disguise as a
260:46
verb or as a noun if you use it as a
260:49
noun you can say put on a disguise put
260:53
on a disguise and disguise can be closed
260:55
too if you want to hide your true
260:58
identity you don't want anybody to know
261:00
who you are put on a disguise disguise
261:04
yourself
261:05
okay next one
261:07
hey you know this guy right that's
261:09
spider-man the amazing spider-man
261:12
he's the good character in a story now
261:15
unfortunately in many stories spider-man
261:18
people think he's a bad guy right but
261:20
spider-man's really he's really the good
261:22
guy who is he he's the hero he's the
261:26
hero of the movie the good character the
261:29
person who does good things and helps
261:32
other people that is the hero of the
261:36
movie okay now
261:38
movies usually have heroes but then also
261:41
movies have somebody who fights against
261:43
the hero the main bad character in a
261:47
story and these are the people who fight
261:50
against the hero right so movies of
261:52
course many movies show conflict you
261:55
have good and evil good guys bad guys
261:59
and they're fighting against each other
262:00
well the heroes are the good guys who
262:02
are the bad guys what do we call them we
262:05
can call them villain a villain is a bad
262:09
guy so villains are the bad characters
262:13
in movies the villains
262:15
are fighting the heroes of the movies
262:19
who wins
262:20
well usually in a movie the hero wins
262:23
right usually especially uh movies about
262:27
superheroes the good guy always wins
262:29
doesn't he or she there's lots of uh
262:32
female heroes too super uh action or
262:35
superheroes that are female as well so
262:37
it's a the the good guy or the good girl
262:40
who always wins in these types of movies
262:43
right but the villains usually lose
262:47
okay
262:49
not caring if you hurt others so if
262:52
somebody doesn't care if you hurt others
262:54
this is a bad thing right it's not a
262:57
good thing it's what the villain would
262:59
do right the villains are ruthless
263:02
ruthless is an adjective it's an
263:05
adjective it's used to describe
263:10
what somebody is like what is their
263:12
personality like what is their character
263:15
like they are ruthless it means they
263:18
don't care if they hurt other people
263:20
that's very bad right a person who
263:23
doesn't care if they hurt other people
263:24
that
263:25
right they just do what they want they
263:27
want to get what they want they don't
263:29
care about other people that's ruthless
263:31
it's bad that would be a villain a bad
263:34
guy or a bad character
263:37
okay
263:38
using great force to hurt others like in
263:41
this movie oh no he's kicking him right
263:44
there that looks very painful right so
263:47
what is this this is violent this is
263:49
violent action
263:51
violent is also an adjective it's an oh
263:55
that's so strange jay isn't it it's an
263:57
adjective uh violent it's a violent
264:00
scene it's a violent act he's a violent
264:05
person so we use violent as an adjective
264:08
in front of a noun to show that
264:11
something or somebody's using great
264:13
force to hurt other people it's a
264:16
violent movie it's a violent uh scene
264:19
it's a violent person okay so violent is
264:23
an adjective to describe person place
264:26
thing
264:27

264:49
human inside and this of course is just
264:52
a robot to show as a main part now to
264:56
show as a main part we are to feature so
264:59
robocop features this character here and
265:02
also this is the bad guy in the end of
265:04
the movie this is also a part of the
265:07
movie to show as a main part the main
265:10
part of a movie especially is the
265:12
feature for example this is usually used
265:16
to describe the actors or actresses in a
265:18
movie for example you can say the new
265:21
movie is going to feature brad pitt that
265:24
means brad pitt will be a main part of
265:27
the movie you could also say the new
265:30
movie will feature new york which means
265:32
a place new york the setting the place
265:35
will be a main part of the movie so to
265:38
show as a main part it can be a person
265:40
it can be a thing it can be you know a
265:43
machine an animal it could be anything
265:45
really it's just a main part of
265:47
something it features that thing or that
265:50
person
265:51
okay
265:53
what we use to speak
265:55
and write
265:57
what am i using right now to speak to
265:59
you i'm using english right
266:02
what is english english is a language of
266:05
course you normally use korean to speak
266:09
and write that is your language right
266:12
now you are learning a different
266:14
language you're learning english so
266:17
language is what we use to speak and
266:20
write notice that this is not language
266:23
be careful these
266:26
i would call these letters
266:29
not alphabets
266:31
don't say these are alphabets these are
266:34
letters alphabet is the whole set of
266:37
letters from a to z in english the whole
266:40
set
266:41
is alphabet
266:43
individual
266:45
symbols are
266:46
letters okay and of course letters are
266:49
part of language these letters are part
266:52
of the english language these letters
266:55
are a feature of the english language
266:58
okay so yeah we work the vocabulary
267:01
together okay next one
267:03
oh what happened to him
267:05
i think he's drinking too much right
267:07
very dangerous
267:09
okay well he fell down and he's probably
267:11
pushing the horn a short high-pitched
267:14
sound so maybe it goes beep beep right
267:17
look at that that's the word some words
267:20
in english
267:22
are the same
267:24
as the sound that they make right so if
267:27
you push the horn on a car right the
267:30
horn on a car it makes a high-pitched
267:32
sound we say that sound is a beep and
267:35
that's what it sounds like it's beep
267:37
beep
267:38
the sound and the word are the same
267:41
sometimes we hear that right sometimes
267:43
that's true in english okay so that's a
267:46
good word there to show that the the
267:48
word and the sound are the same thing
267:51
okay
267:52
next to be successful in a game or fight
267:56
ah what happened here we can see what
267:58
happened very easily oh these two uh
268:02
ladies were playing a game one person is
268:05
going to do what one person is going to
268:07
win
268:08
the other person is going to
268:11
lose
268:12
so
268:13
who do you think won
268:15
who do you think lost
268:17
when is a past is a irregular verb so i
268:20
said one win won one
268:24
who won
268:25
she won obviously who lost oh lose
268:29
lost lost right
268:32
she lost okay so somebody will win
268:35
somebody will lose after the game who
268:37
won
268:38
she won
268:40
she lost okay so which team won that
268:43
team won that team lost
268:46
okay next word wow this is a big
268:48
airplane right this is a plane driven by
268:51
jet engines jet engine is here and here
268:55
now a long time ago
268:57
there were no jet engines planes used
269:01
propellers now i'm not a very good
269:03
artist so i'm trying to draw these
269:06
it looks like a flower doesn't it but
269:08
these things would spin really fast and
269:10
they would catch the air and push the
269:12
plane forward and these were called
269:15
propellers propeller
269:18
a propeller plane so we said propeller
269:21
plane or sometimes we will say prop
269:23
plane propeller plane or prop plane but
269:26
then of course technology improves now
269:28
we have jet engines what kind of plane
269:30
do we call that we call that a jet so
269:33
it's really the same thing a jet engine
269:36
it's a jet if it has a jet engine oh
269:38
there's two more over here too
269:40
don't forget those
269:41
okay if it has a jet engine it is a jet
269:45
okay
269:47
oh that's too bad what happened here a
269:50
problem or difficulty right there's a
269:53
problem with the engine in this car so a
269:55
problem or difficulty is trouble now
269:58
this is a good uh picture to show for
270:01
this word because in this case we can
270:04
say she has
270:07
car
270:08
trouble
270:10
and that's a very common expression
270:12
right she has car trouble do you have
270:14
car trouble if your car breaks down it's
270:17
a very common expression do you have car
270:20
trouble or she has car trouble okay
270:24
interesting expression
270:25
okay next a vehicle for carrying goods
270:29
now a vehicle for carrying goods this is
270:31
a special type of vehicle you would not
270:34
call this a car
270:36
it's not a car it's a
270:38
truck a truck is a big vehicle and it
270:41
has a big area a big space you can put
270:45
many things inside whether it's rocks
270:48
like this or sometimes it's all closed
270:50
and it has a roof and it has a door back
270:53
here and you can put stuff inside that's
270:56
a
270:57
tractor trailer okay uh that carries you
271:00
know like electronic goods from the
271:02
factory to the store or many other types
271:05
of products okay there's many different
271:07
kinds of trucks also a pickup truck
271:10
which is smaller one person uses and
271:13
they can put their furniture or their
271:15
tools in the back of the truck and drive
271:17
to the job but it's much smaller trucks
271:20
are different shapes and sizes
271:22
okay
271:23
oh you know this guy who is that you've
271:26
seen him in the movies before that's
271:28
george clooney so it's kind of an
271:30
interesting picture because here we have
271:32
oh i think i know her too she looks
271:34
familiar i can't remember her name she
271:37
was in the movie fargo okay so anyway
271:40
it's funny that they are famous famous
271:42
actor and famous actress they're
271:44
watching the movies which is the moving
271:47
picture movies these two people are
271:50
famous in the movies and they're in the
271:53
theater right now watching a movie so
271:56
let's go see a movie there's many
271:58
expressions we can use with movie let's
272:01
go see a movie go see
272:04
a movie
272:06
let's go see a movie okay also we say
272:09
movie theater movie
272:12
theater
272:14
okay a movie theater and that's where we
272:16
see moving pictures moving pictures is
272:19
not really a common expression anymore
272:21
it was a common expression when movies
272:23
were first invented because people
272:25
didn't know what movies were they knew
272:27
what pictures were and when the pictures
272:30
moved very quickly they called it moving
272:32
pictures oh it's moving pictures but
272:34
nowadays we don't say moving pictures
272:37
often we say movie
272:39
okay of course movies are very important
272:42
in our lives we probably watch many
272:44
movies
272:45
every week every month maybe even every
272:48
day don't watch too many movies though
272:50
it's not good for your brain okay take
272:53
it easy okay
272:54
now let's uh go over the vocabulary
272:57
exercises now how well do we remember
273:00
those words that we just learned here we
273:03
need to complete each sentence with a
273:05
word from the box so we have many words
273:08
in the box here and we have sentences on
273:11
this and the other slides that we need
273:13
to fill in the blank with the proper
273:16
word let's review the words real quick
273:19
the words in the box are first
273:21
g
273:21
sorry excuse me
273:23
genius
273:24
genius
273:26
that's better
273:27
distant
273:28
distant
273:30
transform
273:32
transform
273:35
disguised
273:37
disguised
273:38
next is hero
273:41
hero
273:42
then villain
273:45
next is
273:46
ruthless
273:47
ruthless
273:49
and then
273:50
violent
273:52
violent okay those are our words
273:55
where do we put these words in the
273:56
sentence which word goes with which
273:58
sentence let's find out number one
274:02
though she is little although she is
274:05
little even though she is little
274:08
she is a peep in mathematics
274:12
okay now this is kind of a strange thing
274:14
because it
274:15
doesn't really matter that she's little
274:17
i mean
274:18
uh maybe it's because maybe you could
274:20
say even though she is young she's
274:22
little maybe she's a little girl right
274:24
that they're talking about
274:25
you don't expect young children to be
274:28
very what in mathematics very smart yeah
274:32
you don't expect children to be very
274:34
smart in mathematics because most
274:37
children are just learning mathematics
274:39
but if you find a child
274:43
or some children or a girl a little boy
274:46
who is very good at mathematics we can
274:49
call them what they're very smart right
274:51
they are a genius in mathematics so even
274:55
though she's a little girl even though
274:57
she's young
274:58
uh she is a genius
275:00
in mathematics okay we don't expect that
275:03
so that's why we say though even though
275:06
it's not expected it's unexpected
275:09
number two the beep businessman made
275:13
little children work too much
275:16
that's a bad businessman
275:18
terrible he doesn't care about the
275:21
feelings or the the welfare of other
275:23
people it doesn't care about other
275:25
people he just wants to get what he
275:27
wants this is really bad bad person what
275:30
did we say about what is a what do we
275:32
just what word do we use to describe
275:35
people who don't care about other people
275:38
we say that those people are
275:41
ruthless they are ruthless so a ruthless
275:44
businessman will make children work too
275:47
much actually
275:49
just making children work is ruthless
275:52
right
275:52
and especially too much that's terrible
275:55
businessmen shouldn't make children work
275:57
at all children should not work they
275:59
should have fun and go to school right
276:01
they're learning they shouldn't work
276:03
until they get older right making
276:05
children work is ruthless
276:08
number three
276:09
the king beep himself as a beggar this
276:13
is interesting so imagine you sometimes
276:16
you hear about this in stories right
276:18
you hear about a king who wants to know
276:21
about the ordinary people so he wants to
276:24
change his appearance so nobody will
276:26
recognize him he wants to what he wants
276:30
to
276:31
disguise himself so the king disguised
276:35
himself as a beggar so he could go out
276:39
and talk to people normally so they
276:41
wouldn't think oh he's a king you know
276:43
they would tell him what they really
276:44
thought okay sometimes we hear stories
276:47
like that that's a common idea in many
276:50
stories okay number four
276:52
the magician magician a person who
276:54
performs magic tricks
276:57
the magician has an ability to beep into
277:01
a bird
277:02
what would a magician do
277:05
what can a magician do it can do
277:07
something into a bird to
277:10
perhaps change himself into a bird to
277:14
change his form into a bird and fly away
277:17
that would be a great magic trick right
277:19
well what word here means to change into
277:22
something else
277:24
of course you're probably looking at
277:25
this word here transform the magician
277:27
has an ability to transform into a bird
277:31
to change himself into a bird that's
277:34
pretty cool
277:36
five usually the beep in a movie does
277:39
not die
277:40
now think about that we're talking about
277:42
characters in the movie right we talked
277:44
about there are good characters and
277:46
there are bad characters the good
277:48
characters are the heroes the bad
277:50
characters are the villains
277:52
which ones usually don't die especially
277:55
in movies like superheroes and things
277:57
like that of course the hero in a movie
278:00
does not die usually doesn't say always
278:04
usually
278:06
in some movies yes the hero dies those
278:07
are sad movies right but usually action
278:10
movies or superhero movies the hero
278:13
doesn't die the hero wins right that's
278:15
what the movie's about good uh always
278:17
wins in those movies but the hero does
278:20
not die okay next one
278:23
even though he is a nice person so even
278:26
though despite
278:28
something unexpected right even though
278:30
he is a nice person he usually plays the
278:33
beep in movies so he's a nice person
278:37
but even though he's a nice person
278:39
despite that fact something unexpected
278:42
he usually plays and that means he acts
278:46
as what in the movies so we're looking
278:48
for something opposite of a nice person
278:50
what's the opposite of the nice person
278:52
or the good guy the opposite of course
278:54
is the villain right even though he is a
278:57
nice person he usually plays the villain
279:00
in movies so he's a nice actor
279:04
the person is nice but he plays a bad
279:06
guy in the movies right he plays a
279:09
villain that makes sense okay
279:11
seven i don't like to watch tv because
279:14
most programs are too what
279:17
are two what are most programs on
279:20
television maybe somebody doesn't like
279:22
it
279:22
uh maybe they don't like the people are
279:24
always fighting or that maybe somebody
279:26
dies what kind of movies are those those
279:29
are violent movies i don't like to watch
279:32
tv because most programs are too violent
279:36
that person doesn't like the violence on
279:38
the movies
279:39
number eight she lives in a beep city
279:43
it's the only word left okay of course
279:45
we're looking at this word she lives in
279:47
a distant city that means far away
279:51
moro
279:52
right
279:53
she lives in a far away city it's funny
279:56
in korean when i was learning korean
279:57
it's very uh chimichanga because in
280:00
korean you know you say yogi is here
280:03
chogi is over there and
280:06
is over there right so that would be
280:08
chagi would be like distance right far
280:11
away distance okay that's just
280:14
it's just kind of funny chummy soil okay
280:16
okay so that wraps up the vocabulary
280:18
section of this lesson let's take a
280:20
short break we'll come back and we'll do
280:22
the reading
280:23
[Music]
280:37
hello and welcome back to reading for
280:39
vocabulary i'm brian stewart
280:42
in this lesson lesson 13
280:44
we're going to talk about computer
280:47
movies we'll focus on thinking about
280:50
movies and books you know
280:53
also what kinds of characters are in
280:56
them so we're going to talk about
280:59
characters in movies but we're really
281:02
going to talk about special types of
281:04
characters what types of characters well
281:07
we'll find out later when we do the
281:08
reading but first let's talk about this
281:12
type of uh
281:14
movie characters that we have here now
281:16
this is kind of interesting did you see
281:18
this movie avatar did you ever wonder
281:21
how did they make the characters in the
281:23
movie well this picture kind of tells
281:26
you this is the real actor who played
281:30
this character in the movie avatar i'm
281:32
sorry i forgot her name but uh in the
281:35
movie but of course there's no creature
281:37
that looks like this right this is her
281:39
again
281:40
and this is what she looks like in real
281:42
life this is what she looks like in the
281:44
movie look at the difference isn't that
281:46
amazing how can they do that well they
281:49
use computer graphics and that's what
281:51
we're going to learn about in this
281:53
lesson
281:54
also you may have seen this movie do you
281:56
remember this movie this character here
281:59
my precious
282:01
right okay this character of course is
282:03
gollum from the lord of the rings is
282:06
there a really a person like that no of
282:09
course not there is not a person like
282:11
that the actor who played gollum
282:14
actually got an award for playing gollum
282:17
but nobody ever saw what he really
282:20
looked like he was wearing a suit right
282:23
with all these
282:24
lights on it and
282:26
when they put his image in the computer
282:28
they can make his image look like this
282:32
and who's that
282:33
of course that's
282:34
yoda i am right i'm sorry i'm not a very
282:37
good i can't imitate yoda very well but
282:39
this is yoda from star wars ex was kind
282:42
of silly seeing him jump around
282:44
you know with the lightsaber but that
282:47
was yoda again there's no real creature
282:50
like yoda there's not real again it was
282:52
computer graphics
282:54
so when we talk about these characters
282:57
in the movies we're going to be talking
282:59
about how they can make these types of
283:01
characters especially using computer
283:04
graphics okay well let's take a look at
283:07
one more picture from the movies and
283:09
this movie also kind of illustrates how
283:12
movie directors can make
283:14
scenes especially in the background of
283:16
course this person here is real and
283:19
probably the mask he's wearing on his
283:21
face is real but this scene in the
283:23
background that's not real right that's
283:25
a computer graphic it's probably a blue
283:28
screen right and what these people these
283:31
actors act in front of a colored screen
283:34
and then on the computer after they make
283:36
the film they can add all sorts of
283:39
interesting images in the background to
283:42
uh that blue screen that the actors are
283:45
actually acting in front of
283:47
okay well let's begin of course with our
283:50
first word on our word list for the
283:52
vocabulary now this is an interesting
283:55
picture
283:56
this character here of course there's no
283:59
such thing as a skeleton that can move

285:04
simple
285:05
uh example of the word this is a very
285:08
simple costume
285:10
a costume is something you wear to look
285:13
special
285:14
what are they why would
285:16
the the kid here wear a costume like

the eyes that's a very simple costume
285:34
it's got a very cheap costume too but
285:37

285:38

286:36
not real something that is not real this
286:39
man is looking at the money and trying
286:41
to think is this real or is it
286:45
phony is it phony a phony twenty dollar
286:49
bill or actually that looks it could be
286:51
a euro i'm not sure what currency that
286:53
is but if the money is not real if it's
286:56
phony it's worthless right unfortunately
286:59
there are bad people who make
287:02
fake copies of money and try to use it
287:05
as real money and it's phony money
287:08
there's another word that's very common
287:10
we use for that we say fake
287:13
if something is fake it's the same as
287:15
saying
287:16
phony not real it's fake it's not real
287:20
it's phony it's not real ph is is
287:23
pronounced as

phony okay so it's phony not real or
287:28
it's fake okay next one
287:31
okay now here we have a picture here
287:33
when i first saw this picture i'm like
287:35
wow is that real it looks so perfect
287:38
doesn't it it's a perfect town and then
287:41
looked at the boats and i'm like what
287:42
about this boat is that boat real but
287:46
yes it is real looking like something
287:47
real is realistic it is realistic and of
287:51
course it is real because there are
287:53
boats like that and you can see the
287:54
detail in the water everything here is
287:58
uh looking very realistic it is very
288:01
realistic we believe that this is an
288:03
actual picture and it probably is
288:05
realistic means looking like something
288:08
real
288:09
next one oh
288:11
what's wrong with him he's feeling fear
288:14
what can we say about him
288:16
is he
288:18
frightened he is frightened we wouldn't
288:21
say he is frightening no we wouldn't say
288:24
that we would say he's frightened
288:26
because that's his reaction to something
288:28
that is frightening be careful right we
288:32
may have talked about this before
288:34
frightening
288:36
use ing
288:38
for the thing that causes
288:41
someone to react
288:43
by being frightened
288:45
frightening
288:47
frightened we can also say he is scared
288:52
he is scared or he is afraid
288:56
right these are all synonyms for
289:00
frightened he's frightened he's afraid
289:03
he's scared he saw something that is
289:06
frightening okay so frightened means
289:10
that he is feeling fear
289:13
next one
289:14
now you know this painting right this is
289:16
a very famous painting uh painted by a
289:19
very famous
289:20
artist who lived in italy a long time
289:23
ago do you know
289:25
the name of this painting it's called
289:27
the mona lisa right and why is it such a
289:32
famous painting because it looks like a
289:35
real person or thing even though this is
289:38
just a painting it was painted a long
289:40
time ago and it was painted with such
289:43
skill that this woman it looks life like
289:47
it looks lifelike i just used that word
289:49
yeah lifelike it looks lifelike looks
289:53
like a real person or thing of course
289:55
the woman who modeled for this painting
289:59
she was real but it's amazing that the
290:02
artist's skill the talent that the
290:04
artist leonardo da vinci could paint
290:07
such a life-like picture of the actual
290:11
woman okay
290:13
okay next one
290:15
to tell the difference here we have a
290:17
picture of many people raising their uh
290:19
signs they're saying yes they're
290:21
agreeing but there's one person in the
290:22
middle says no
290:24
and they're different from the other
290:26
people that person we can distinguish
290:30
that person because we can easily see
290:32
the difference when you distinguish
290:36
distinguish
290:37
distinguish when you distinguish
290:40
something that means you can see the
290:43
difference
290:44
for example can you distinguish who is
290:47
the boss and who are the employees can
290:51
you tell can you see the difference can
290:53
you tell the difference between the boss
290:56
and the employees sometimes you can't
290:58
you have to watch and see how people act
291:01
then you can distinguish who the who's
291:03
the boss and who are the employees but
291:05
sometimes if you just look very quickly
291:07
you can't other things are very easy to
291:10
distinguish it's very easy to
291:12
distinguish if you see several people
291:14
and one person is blonde and the other
291:16
people have brown hair then you can
291:19
easily distinguish the blonde person
291:21
right away you can tell the difference
291:24
distinguish
291:25
okay
291:27
person has an idea it's represented with
291:30
this drawing we usually use this idea
291:32
light bulb a light bulb
291:35
is going turning on in her head a light
291:38
bulb is turning on in her head that's a
291:41
common idea
291:42
having new ideas and making new things
291:45
if somebody can do this many times
291:48
during the day
291:49
we call them creative because they have
291:52
many new ideas have new ideas or making
291:56
new things if you think of new ideas if
292:00
you can think of new ways to draw
292:04
or new ways to make something then
292:06
perhaps you are creative too also
292:09
authors are creative they come up with
292:11
different stories like jk rawlings who
292:14
wrote the harry potter series she's very
292:17
creative to think of all those
292:19
characters and all those new ideas for a
292:22
story right so there are many creative
292:25
people in the world they think of new
292:27
things and they make new things
292:30
okay number nine
292:32
this is very a beautiful landscape the
292:35
appearance
292:36
of a place so we're looking at the
292:39
principle like don't worry about the
292:40
woman
292:41
but we're looking about the appearance
292:42
you know very interesting distinguishing
292:45
mountains right but if we look at some
292:47
place
292:48
we say wow the beep is very beautiful we
292:52
say the scenery is very beautiful it's
292:55
the appearance of a place what a place
292:58
looks like if you go up into the
293:00
mountains it's very beautiful scenery
293:02
you go to the beach you look out over
293:04
the ocean and the beach the sand that's
293:07
beautiful scenery sometimes scenery
293:09
isn't so beautiful if you go to a train
293:12
station
293:13
scenery is not so good or if you go to a
293:16
town that there are many factories the
293:18
scenery is not so good so scenery
293:20
doesn't mean good or bad it's just what
293:23
things look like what is the scenery
293:26
where you live
293:27
okay
293:29
speed limit is 25
293:31
miles per hour in korea you would say
293:34
kilometers per hour
293:36
but it's the greatest amount of possible
293:39
and i said the word is actually right
293:41
here it's limit right the word we're
293:43
looking for is limit so limit means the
293:47
greatest amount possible that means the
293:49
greatest amount you can drive the speed
293:52
that you can drive in this area is 25
293:56
whether it's miles per hour or
293:58
kilometers per hour depends what country
294:00
you're in right but
294:02
it's the limit you can't go over that
294:05
you cannot go over that if you do you'll
294:07
get arrested right it's the greatest
294:09
amount possible in this case under the
294:12
law but it's the greatest amount
294:14
possible in a certain place it's the
294:17
limit
294:19
okay she's having a good good time right
294:21

294:36
would be x i what x i
294:40
ted you got it good her reaction would
294:43
be excited the cause is exciting
294:46
something that causes great interest is
294:48

295:33
edge is the end there's no more land
295:36

300:20
creative
300:22
creative okay those are the words in the
300:25
box let's see where they go in the
300:28
sentences number one
300:30
the bad boys
300:32
right don't you say nothing you just say
300:34

301:25
that
301:26
number two
301:28
an expert can beep real pearls from
301:32
imitations so an expert
301:35
this is kind of similar to phony right
301:37
think about real pearls from imitations
301:41
imitations would be phony pearls
301:45
now
301:46
what is a pearl
301:48
a pearl is a precious
301:50
it's like a stone you find it in an
301:52
oyster or a clam it's a round white and
301:56
sometimes very beautiful if you get a
301:58
good pearl very beautiful i like stone
302:01
and people will use it in jewelry
302:03
especially necklaces now of course an
302:05
expert can tell
302:07
because some people tried to copy the
302:10
real pearl from nature right but an
302:13
expert can
302:15
tell the difference
302:16
what's another word for tell the
302:18
difference another word that we talked
302:20
about here is

distinguish so an expert can distinguish
302:26
real pearls from limitations it means an
302:29
expert can
302:31
tell the difference between a real pearl
302:34
and a phony pearl an imitation a fake
302:38
pearl okay and of course you have to be
302:41
careful there's people out there who try
302:43
to cheat they'll make phony money
302:45
they'll make phony pearls they'll make
302:47
phony
302:48
gems
302:49
diamonds and things like that but how do
302:52
you know usually experts can look at
302:55
them and they know because they're
302:56
experts they know a lot about their
302:58
subject
302:59
okay next one number three i don't
303:01
believe that you can fly i don't believe
303:03
that you can fly who can fly i don't
303:06

303:09

uh something that is real or true to
303:37
life
303:38
okay four this fake flower is really
303:42
what it's interesting a lot of these
303:45
sentences are using fake phony imitation
303:49
a lot of the subjects a lot of these
303:51
words have to do with that idea
303:53
so this fake flower not a real flower
303:56
but a fake flower is really what
304:00
is really
304:02
life like it's fake but it looks
304:05

304:50

305:04
costume for koreans
305:07
hanbok right it's what koreans would
305:10
have worn a long time ago 100 years ago
305:12
you could also say that is a costume in
305:15
germany they would wear lederhosen right
305:17
it's a traditional german dress
305:20
for germany every country has different
305:23
traditional costumes there's special

you're frightened by
307:21
a dead body but you are filled with
307:25
some with horror at the site so that's
307:27

308:00
[Music]
308:14
hello everybody welcome back to reading
308:16
for vocabulary i'm brian stewart we're
308:19
looking at our unit title here imaginary
308:23

308:26
many different imaginary characters in

308:46
really get excited about them can't we
308:48
well in this lesson we're going to learn
308:51
about an imaginary character his name is
308:55
paul bunyan and it's called mighty
308:58
mighty paul bunyan because mighty means
309:01
strong we'll look at that in the
309:02
vocabulary in this lesson we're going to
309:05
learn about mighty paul bunyan he's an
309:08
imaginary character we can see him here
309:12
whoa he's really tall isn't he
309:15
paul bunyan was thought to be a giant
309:18
right now people think you know is there
309:21
a real person
309:23
sometimes stories are based on a real
309:25
person and people were thinking was
309:27
there a real person named paul bunyan
309:31
we're not sure this
309:33
story he's a character in a folk tale a
309:37
folk
309:39
tale
309:40
folk tales are stories that people tell
309:44
each other from a long time ago
309:47
and sometimes folk tales
309:49
might have
309:50
a true story as the beginning we but we
309:54
don't know because nobody wrote it down
309:57
they just told each other for many many
310:00
years and sometimes the story grows and
310:02
gets bigger and the characters
310:05
change a little bit maybe there was a
310:08
really big uh
310:10
character a long time ago who was like
310:12
paul bunyan but nowadays when we think
310:15
about paul bunyan we think about a giant
310:18
right he's many meters tall right and he
310:22
has an ax here this is an ax
310:25
and what does he do he cuts down trees
310:29
his folk tale the folk tales about paul
310:32
bunyan were a long time ago in america
310:36
when many men went into the forest and
310:38
cut down trees for wood because
310:42
the nation america needed wood to build
310:45
houses and to build many things so there
310:47
were many
310:48
people like him
310:50
in the world and so these stories
310:52
started but who's that what is this this
310:55
is a big blue cow
310:57
well actually it's not a cow it's an ox
311:00
it's a
311:02
babe
311:03
whoops
311:04
babe his name was babe
311:07
the
311:08
blue
311:11
babe the blue ox and we'll learn about
311:14
his character later but babe the blue ox
311:17
and paul bunyan they were partners right
311:20
they were friends okay and babe the blue
311:23
ox was a big uh kind of like a cow an ox
311:27
is like a cow but it's a very big and
311:30
strong cow with big horns as you can see
311:34
so these are the characters we're going
311:36
to learn about today in this lesson but
311:39
first let's start with the vocabulary
311:41
words first of all we have this person
311:44
he looks familiar he kind of looks like
311:47
paul bunyan
311:48
but this word is a person who cuts down
311:51
trees
311:52
this describes paul bunyan's job what
311:56
was paul bunyan's job what was he he was
312:00
a whoa it's a big word a lumberjack
312:04
lumber
312:06

312:07
now you may know the word lumber lumber
312:10
is wood wood from trees is lumber jack
312:15
maybe just the name of a person
312:17
lumberjack is a person who cuts down
312:21
trees
312:22
paul bunyan was a lumberjack
312:26

312:31
do you ever go camping with your friends
312:34

312:51
at a camp it's actually a
312:54
camp fire camp fire see we use these two
312:57
words together and it's called campfire
313:00
so you build a little fire at your camp
313:04
and many people will tell stories around
313:07
the campfire and so we can think of many
313:10
imaginary characters like paul bunyan
313:14
people are telling stories around the
313:16
camp fire okay next one
313:19
oh okay these kids are having a fun time
313:22
they look very happy don't they they're
313:24
listening to a story another word for a
313:28
story is a tale
313:31
tale and story
313:33

313:37
a tale before i taught you folk tale
313:41

313:50
next one total a total so if everybody
313:54
gets together they are the total they
313:56
are the whole let's say these people are
313:58
working together they are a whole team
314:02
right they are the total sum of the team
314:06
if one person is missing they're not
314:08
whole they must be together to have the
314:11
team maybe an office
314:13
team in the office or
314:15
some type of
314:16
organization they are the whole team but
314:19
it's not just people right it can be a
314:22
set of toys if you have five different
314:25
toys they make the total set they are
314:28
the whole set so in that case you could
314:31
say the whole set of
314:34
toys
314:36
the whole set of food the whole set of
314:41
whatever the whole they're all together
314:43

314:46
beautiful picture of nature right don't
314:48
you want to go there this is a place
314:51
without people there's nobody in this
314:54
place
314:55
it's
314:57
nobody lives there maybe people have
315:00
walked through there before but if you
315:02
look at the picture there's nobody there
315:04
and there's no sign of any human
315:07
activity this is what we call wilderness
315:11
wilderness that's a long word wilderness
315:15
wilderness now i said will der ness but
315:19
actually it comes from this word here
315:21
wild
315:23
if you think of just nature right just
315:26
nature
315:29
nature
315:30
natural is wild it's in the wild right
315:34
we we don't live in the wild we live in
315:37
villages or towns or cities
315:41
but if we go away from all of that and
315:44
there's no sign of any human activity
315:47
that's just nature it's in the wild okay
315:50
and we call places like that wilderness
315:53
there's no homes no roads no telephones
315:56
maybe you can have your cell phone maybe
315:58
you have coverage but there's nothing
316:01
there except for nature trees mountains
316:05

316:12
area where fruit trees are grown this is
316:14
not wilderness right this is a farm it's
316:18
a place especially it's a an area where
316:20
fruit trees are grown we have a special
316:23
name for this kind of farm it's called

316:42
trees and these trees are grown
316:46
in a field like this they're not just
316:48
you know random trees out in nature
316:51
farmers will plant the cherry trees or
316:53
the apple trees or the orange trees in
316:56
rows so they're all there and they're
316:58
easy to pick and that's called an
317:00
orchard right so if you want to get

just to hold something with a rope you
322:56
tie it also if you have many things you
322:59
want to carry from one place to another
323:02
you could put packages or your backpack
323:05
you could tie it to the back of your
323:07
bicycle and it doesn't fall off when you
323:10
ride to school so you could tie many
323:13

strong and he's really powerful he can
323:51
do many things with his body because
323:54
he's really strong he's very powerful
323:57
okay
323:59
next one to move something from side to
324:02
side very fast so if something's moving
324:04
like this if you take something in your
324:06
hand and you move it like this or up and
324:08
down you know around
324:10
let's say you want to mix something
324:13
right so you have ice and lemonade and
324:16
you mix it like this
324:19
what are you doing you are shaking to
324:22
shake you can also just shake your body
324:25
like this right if you're cold people
324:27
shake okay stop shaking
324:30
okay stop shaking so shake is to shake
324:33
also very common what else do we shake
324:36
we shake hands right when we meet
324:39
another person we shake their hands
324:42
that's what western people do especially
324:44
in america right in korea we usually bow
324:47
but in america they usually shake the
324:49
hands of the person and that's like
324:51
saying hello how are you
324:53
sheikh is an irregular verb so we use it
324:57
it changes form in the past okay so we
325:01
say sheikh
325:02
shook shaken
325:05
okay
325:06
shake shook
325:08
shaken that's how we use this word in
325:10
the past it's an irregular verb okay
325:13
next one
325:15
here is
325:17
another
325:18
picture of a it looks like a cow right
325:21
but it looks like a little bit of a
325:22
strange cow it's not a normal cow look
325:25
at this it's a bull used for farm work
325:28
right so it's a bull a bull means namja
325:32
right not yoja namja so it's a namja cow
325:36
okay but it's used for farm work and
325:38
look it's got these big horns whoa okay
325:42
it's got a big hump on its back and it
325:44
looks very strong right there's a
325:47
special word we use for that it's ox
325:50
aha remember paul bunyan's friend i told
325:54
you about before was a big blue ox okay
325:58
so that's an imaginary character but
326:00
it's based on this type of animal a bull
326:03
of a namja a male cow used for working
326:07
on the farm they you know you can tie
326:10
something to the ox and it will pull
326:12
something usually farmers use the auxes
326:15
to help them plow the field
326:18
plow
326:20
the
326:21
field and what they do
326:23
is they put a big blade like a big piece
326:26
of iron and the ox drags it on the
326:30
ground and it digs a line and the
326:32
farmers can plant their uh plants in
326:35
that line so oxes are used to plow the
326:38
field that's called to plow the field
326:41
and so oxes and horses are used to do
326:44
that
326:45
okay but oxes are very strong and they
326:48
may be stronger than horses sometimes
326:51
okay
326:52
15.
326:53
oh no it's terrible right mogi
326:57
right a mosquito came and bit her on the
327:00

327:06

327:09
on your skin that you want to scratch so
327:12

327:20

as a verb it itches my foot itches oh my
328:08
hand itches
328:09

328:23
scratch and itch don't say i itch my arm
328:27
no that's crazy you don't itch your arm
328:29
your arm itches so you scratch it okay
328:33
but be careful don't scratch it too much
328:36
because that's not good if your hand is
328:38
dirty and you scratch it too hard you
328:42

chop down
329:13
trees so they they hit the tree with the

329:20

329:20
chop down means to use an axe
329:24
to make something fall oh by the way

329:28
axe before on the first picture when i

cutting down a tree now remember in the
337:20
vocabulary section it was our first word
337:23
we talked about a person who cuts down a
337:26
tree so we're looking for the person
337:29
it's a job title
337:31

337:34
trees
337:35
which word means a person whose job it

337:59
i cut chop down trees i eat my lunch and
338:02
i go to the lava tree
338:04
okay so it's kind of an it's an old song

group called monty python
338:11
look them up but lumberjack what does he
338:13
do i'm a lumberjack and i'm okay

i cut down trees i eat my lunch and i go
338:20
to the lavatory
338:22
lavatory what's lavatory i have to teach
338:24
you that because it's in the song a
338:27
lavatory and sometimes people say lavora
338:31
lavatory but in the song it's it's you
338:34
can also pronounce it lavatory lavatory
338:37
is another word for bathroom and english
338:40
is crazy we have so many words for
338:43
bathroom bathroom of course is hua jiung
338:46
shil right so you can say where is the
338:49
bathroom
338:50

338:52
bathroom sometimes people call it the
338:55
rest room where is the rest room
339:00
some people even say where is the i'll
339:03
put it up here where is the toilet
339:06
but that's not so polite it's more
339:09
polite to say bathroom restroom or
339:11
lavatory
339:12
or lavatory right
339:14
restroom bathroom lavatory toilet okay
339:18
also one more wc but that's a little
339:20
old-fashioned wc what is wc wc is
339:26
water
339:28
closet because a long
339:31
time ago
339:32
when the toilet
339:34
was first invented it was put into
339:36
people's houses
339:38
they didn't know what to call it it's
339:40
like a small room in the house that's a
339:42
closet but it had water in it you know a
339:45
long time ago before when people didn't
339:48
have they weren't used to having water
339:50
in the house plumbing was new so they
339:53
called it a water closet some people in
339:55
some countries still call it water
339:58
closet but it's a little old-fashioned
340:00
americans usually say bathroom or
340:02
restroom lavatory or lavatory water
340:06
closet more common in england or britain
340:10
okay
340:11
americans will normally say bathroom or
340:14
restroom anyway that's a very long
340:16
explanation
340:17
we came from lumberjack from the song
340:20
i'm a lumberjack and i'm okay i chop
340:22
