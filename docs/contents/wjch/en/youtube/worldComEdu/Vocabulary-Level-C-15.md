result
the opposite pandero of success

step like this right but when you walk
you make a step one step two step
and you walk like that don't walk like
this at all
oh up by all right be careful
but of course it's humorous right he's

imagine this
could be like a chain and a gear right
it kind of looks like your i hope it

that's very old right i hope your
bicycle looks
newer than that but imagine if this was
working if this was turning
and the chain was moving it would make a
short
high sound right it would go oh
a very terrible sound because it's very
old
and there's no oil right
there's no oil there so we would say
it's squeaky
squeaky try the door on your room
open the door and close it or the house
on your front door of your house
does it make a sound i can't do it very
well with my voice
but you can hear that you need to put
some oil
on the metal so it doesn't squeak
we say it's squeaky the door is squeaky
my bicycle is squeaky
it means the metal is moving and making
that noise
because there's no oil there so if it's
squeaky
put some oil there okay squeaky is a
high

spider-man
spider-man is the main character he's
the most
important if he's obsimian right if he's

movie who's the most important
uh character in the movie okay those are
our words
let's take a look at the vocabulary
exercises
in this case we must we must complete
each sentence

okay so the singer's new song was a

the painter's room was filled with a lot
of what
the painter's room a painter
of course paints but before the painter
paints
the painter will probably make a picture
with pencil
you know or some kind of tool to draw
right so the painter's room was filled
with a lot of
drawings because painters will usually
draw something
and then they'll paint it right that's
usually how painters work
so the painters room was filled with a
lot of drawings
okay number three the animated beep

chance
read the book it's a very good story but
this is like the name
of the book right it's the name of the

saw that it could be a person
it could be an animal it could be almost
anything really anything that moves
acts says something in a story
a book a movie there are many different
uh what in a movie the dog is one of the
most popular
characters in the tv show we use
s even though we're talking about the

because we say one of the most
one of the most means there's more than
one so we have to use
s the dog is one of the most popular
characters in the tv
show it means there are many popular
characters in the tv show the dog is one
of those characters one of the most
popular
characters in the tv show okay the last

you have talent i have
a talent for music now notice they say
a talent for a talent for you can say
that
but you can also say you have talent
you just say i have talent
and just end the story and the sentence
there
i have talent or i have a talent
for momo i have a talent for music
i have a talent for sports i have a
talent
for entertaining okay so you can use it
both ways
i have talent or i have a talent for
something in this case we see that i
have a talent for music
so i want to be a pianist when i grow up
okay
eight i like movies with good beep
because i like to laugh good what
you like movies with good because you

06:27
like if uh you you have a bicycle
06:30
the name of your bicycle is bicycle it's

not the title
06:34
right so the name of something we're
06:36
usually talking about a book
06:38
or a movie or some other work
06:42
that is imaginary it's an imaginary
06:44
story
06:45
or it could be a real story but it's the
06:47
title the title of a book
06:49
the title of a play the title of a movie
06:52
the title of a comic book
06:53
it's the title of something the name of
06:56

06:57
okay next one a good result he's very
07:01
happy
07:01
he had a good result he had
07:05
success success maybe it's a little
07:08
difficult to pronounce
07:10
success hopefully you will have success
07:13
in your life
07:14
you will have a good result of course
07:17
the opposite of a good result is a bad
07:19
result
07:20
the opposite pandero of success
07:23
is failure but
07:27
don't worry even if you have a failure
07:31
those will teach you how to next time
07:35
get success so everybody has failures
07:37
and success
07:38
but use your failure to teach you how to
07:42
get
07:42
success without failure we don't
07:45
understand success right
07:47
failure teaches us how to get success
07:51
so these are pandero success and failure
07:54
but we'll have failures in our lives but
07:56
we'll also have successes
