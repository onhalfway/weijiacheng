i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
we're going over social studies book

lesson two various celebrations
so in this unit you will discover what
kinds of celebrations there are and
what some famous holidays there are
okay so let's begin
we always begin with vocabulary and our
first word is
festival sorry festival
festival a festival is a day
or time of celebration a day
means a whole day or a certain time
that people celebrate we have this word
here celebration of course that's also

pen celebrate okay sorry about that
to celebrate to celebrate means to
rejoice to have fun to recognize
something great like an event or you can
celebrate
people as well so to celebrate is to
like kind of have a party
because you want to honor something you
want to recognize something or
someone for example every year
you celebrate your birthday right and
that is a type of celebration
but a festival is when people get
together
and they all celebrate like a holiday or
some event
and that's a festival
next we have the word religious
religious o-u-s means
full of so for example
famous full of fame
religious full of religion
aha okay so relating to religion
somebody who is religious of course they
have a religion they believe
in a god or gods right so they
have religion they are religious
okay patriot a patriot is a person who
lives
who loves not well they live in their
country but they
love their country so if you really love
your country
and you think your country is the a
great country maybe
you know you can go too much obviously
your country my country is the greatest
in the world well
okay be careful with that though but but
of course you love your country
you love your family you love where you
grew up
you're you were born there that's that's
what you know
right so you're a patriot you support
your country and you
uh support the uh community and the
nation
in which you live you are a patriot
okay parade we talked about festival
before we talked about celebrations
right
a festival is where people will
celebrate a certain event or
people and usually during a festival
there
might be many parades a parade
is a line of people could be cars
could be uh big vehicles that aren't
really cars but they're they're kind of
like cars but they have a big platform
and statues or
or people on them and it's very
fantastical very colorful very
interesting float we call those floats
and a musical band that moves through a
public place
so parades usually go through city
streets
you don't really see a parade out in the
middle of the country i mean
what's going on you know the cows will
be happy but
usually you have a parade a parade
through a populated area
so that many people can appreciate and
join in
the the excitement and the joy of
celebrating some event
and the people in the parade have
organized they've practiced
they they put a lot of effort into
either playing musical instruments
or in wearing special costumes
or making great designs or interesting
colorful floats to celebrate a certain
event
so parades a very famous parade is a
thanksgiving parade the macy's macy's
parade during thanksgiving in new york
city
where macy's department store the
tradition they have a parade for
thanksgiving day and they have a lot of
different um
big balloons huge huge balloons of
different characters
from culture but there's many different
kinds of parades
next we have a feast a feast is a large
meal
for a celebration a feast is like a lot
of food
okay so a very good example of this is
in america thanksgiving families will
get together
they'll they'll cook a turkey right this
is a turkey
and they'll have lots of stuffing you
know here we have grapes you can have
potatoes
uh corn uh cranberry sauce
gravy oh i'm getting hungry okay but
anyway there's a lot of food
right and that's a feast and people
usually traditionally will celebrate
holidays and special events
by eating a large meal together with
their family because that's
a great way to have a good time to have
a party to rejoice
and to remember something that's
important
to their culture or their tradition so
let's have
a feast okay our next word is
firework although we usually say
fireworks
because there are many of them and what
are fireworks basically
fireworks it says a display to show
colorful lights for fun
but this is a little bit could be a
little bit confusing
don't get confused with like electric
lights no
these are lights caused by gunpowder
and gunpowder shot up into the sky with
rockets okay and the rockets will shoot
up in the sky and they'll explode
in a colorful explosion of light
now of course fireworks uh originated
from china
but uh you know countries all over the
world use fireworks and you've probably
seen
firework displays before
and in some countries fireworks are very
very common i remember i lived in the
philippines for about a year
and something's like almost every night
they were firing fireworks on big
fireworks
the hotels would do that around the area
for advertising i think
and things like that but fireworks are
very common for celebrations
what's a celebration without some
fireworks a famous celebration in
america of course
that uses fireworks is the 4th of july
independence day
that's very common that's kind of like
what the picture shows you know the
capitol building in washington dc
and there are many fireworks well
they're very colorful because those are
they're explosions
and the explosion shoots out different
dyes or different chemicals
to make bright colors reds greens blues
yellows very colorful display and good
fireworks display they'll have like a
big show at the end you know they'll
shoot up some rockets but at the end
they're just going off all over the
place it's really exciting
and you really have to be there it's
hard to explain but uh
that very very interesting fireworks are
very common
to use for celebrations okay next
speech have you ever given a speech
many people are nervous about speaking
in front of other people
you give a speech right i need to give a
speech tomorrow i have to give a speech
for my class
but you give a speech and a speech of
course
is
something that you say it's a prepared
remarks
usually has an introduction body
conclusion it's
speaking by a speaker in front of many
people they are
giving a speech so i have some remarks i
have some comments
i have some things i would like to tell
many people i will
give a speech but a speech is usually a
prepared
group of remarks and it has some
structure to it
if you just get up in front of a
television camera and have a press
release or just answer questions
that's not a speech a speech is
something you wrote about
you thought about and then you stand up
before other people
and you give that speech okay
those are our words for this lesson
okay let's go over the two main ideas in
this unit
and the first main idea is that there
are many different types of holidays we
have religious celebrations and we have
national celebrations national
celebrations are on the top
and whoops on the top and religious
celebrations
are on the bottom so of course there's
many different types of celebrations in
america
now national celebrations these kind of
honor the history
of america and they're important to
americans
because of their history basically
memorial day is a good example
memorial day is a day in which americans
honor the people the men and women who
died while fighting wars for america
it's interesting memorial day was
actually started after the civil war
in america and it honors both the north
and the south
soldiers who died while fighting the
civil war because of course they're all
american soldiers
and the special day was set aside to
honor those men
who died while fighting now veterans day
also honors soldiers but it is a day
to honor especially living soldiers
soldiers are men and women who served in
the armed forces
who are still alive but it's a
expression of thanks for their service
and veterans day was established after
world war one
many americans died in world war one it
was a terrible war they called it the
great war
and after that war they established a
veterans day
to honor those men who went overseas and
fought
in europe for democracy
in that war then we have thanksgiving
day thanksgiving day doesn't have to do
with soldiers or wars
it has to do with the very early
history of america before america was
even a country
english settlers coming over to what is
now america
had a very difficult time because they
weren't
used to the environmental conditions it
was different environmental conditions
than what they were used to and of
course they were far away from
what they what their own civilization it
was hard to get supplies
things that they were familiar with and
comfortable with
so the first few years while they
struggled to survive when they had a
good harvest
in the fall they celebrated and they
want to give thanks to their god
so that was that's thanksgiving day it's
a time of giving thanks
for being able to survive and having a
good harvest
in a new and difficult environment a new
and difficult land
so that's thanksgiving day and nowadays
we celebrate it in
november and it's usually the third
weekend in november the third thursday
and it's a big holiday we have thursday
and usually friday off
and the whole family gets together and
has a big turkey dinner
okay to celebrate good harvest and also
to express
thanks for the good things in our lives
those are national celebrations we also
have religious celebrations and of
course
americans have come from all corners of
the earth
and they bring their religions with them
of course we have christmas
christmas celebrates the birth of jesus
christ
however it's not just christians who
celebrate christmas in america
christmas in america has become more of
a a holiday
for everybody and some people uh you
know just
they just concentrate on santa claus or
exchanging presents
and it's really a holiday where people
exchange
presents uh for each other and of course
it's rooted in christian
uh tradition uh to celebrate the birth
of jesus but as you know the story
the three wise men came from the east
and they were giving gifts to jesus
so nowadays people celebrate by giving
gifts to each other
and it's more it's not just a christian
holiday anymore it's more of kind of a
it's almost a national holiday nowadays
because whether
people are christian or not they do
celebrate christmas
uh in this way then we have ramadan
ramadan is a whole month long
and it's a month long to recognize the
lunar
calendar it's based on the lunar
calendar not the solar calendar
so the time of ramadan might change but
muslims celebrate it
and to observe ramadan they do not
eat or drink anything when the sun
is in the sky after the sun goes down
then they can eat
so it's a little difficult living
through ramadan unless you were a night
owl
and you sleep during the day so that's
ramadan
and then of course the jewish holiday or
one of the jewish holidays is
passover and passover celebrates a very
old story of an angel coming
through a town in biblical times and
killing the firstborn sons and the
jewish people
marked their doors so the angel wouldn't
visit them and leave their family alone
so that's a very old story too but it's
a religious holiday as well
and jewish people will celebrate that
as their religious celebration so like i
said
these are just three examples of many
religious celebrations in america
and of course there are many different
kinds because again
america is a nation of immigrants many
people bringing their religion
with them when they come to america
okay
okay now let's do the reading together
and as usual i'll read it out loud
please repeat after me focus on
pronunciation
and also focus on the words that we
learned in the vocabulary section
are you ready here we go
in the u.s people celebrate
many different kinds of festivals
and religious holidays
in my town each year on memorial day
and veterans day we celebrate
patriots
we try to remember what they did
for our country this is a time
when we enjoy watching a street parade
with
bands and performers
on thanksgiving day my family enjoys
a delicious feast together
in the evening we watch the fireworks
show
and sing songs together
easter and christmas are christian
religious celebrations in the u.s
muslim people celebrate ramadan
and jewish people celebrate passover
during important festivals and
celebrations
people spend time with family and do not
go to work
they want to have a good time with their
families
sometimes an important person gives a
speech
celebrations are a fun time to enjoy
music food and family
okay so how is this reading passage
organized
it is organized under the organizational
model
classify and as we saw when we looked at
the main ideas
of course there are many different types
of celebrations or
holidays in america there are national
national religious and cultural
celebrations so we're classifying
different types
what type of celebration is each one
first of all we have memorial day and
veterans day
those two are very similar right because
they honor soldiers
who fought in wars
so what are they we celebrate
we celebrate what who are the people the
soldiers
that fought in these wars what do we
call them remember the vocabulary word
we celebrate patriots pay
tree uts so we celebrate
patriots make sure my tea is crossed
okay there we go patriots
we enjoy watching a street parade this
is a type of
national holiday so we celebrate
patriots we enjoy watching a street
parade
next we have peep and christmas they are
christian celebrations so which two
celebrations do we talk about
that are celebrated by christians well
of course there's christmas the
the birth of jesus but also what other
holiday did i mention
i mentioned easter right easter is also
a christian holiday
easter so easter and christmas
are christian celebrations we classify
those
as christian celebrations not national
celebrations
christian celebrations types of
religious celebrations
we also have two more types of religious
celebrations but they aren't christian
uh they are different and those are the
blanks okay we have ramadan
and passover so who celebrates
ramadan as i said before
muslim people celebrate ramadan
muslim mus lim
so when we talk about muslims muslims
refer to the people
islam refers to the religion
so don't get confused by that sometimes
people get confused there
so islam is the religion muslim
is the person who practices islam or
believes in
islam so muslim people celebrate ramadan
and of course muslim we don't put
muslims s
because here muslim is an adjective
people
is the noun so we wouldn't put s on
muslim okay so muslim people celebrate
ramadan
and what religion what religious
group celebrates passover it would be
jewish and again we don't put jewish is
right we don't put
s on jewish because so jewish
jewish people celebrate passover because
again jewish is an adjective
and people is the noun so muslim people
jewish people
muslim people celebrate ramadan and
jewish people celebrate
passover and christian people celebrate
christmas of course you can say
christians celebrate
christmas jews celebrate passover and
muslims
celebrate ramadan so it depends on how
you construct
your sentences okay well
that is our lesson as you can see we in
this lesson we learned about many
different types of celebrations
and as i said before i'll say it again
america has lots of different kinds of
celebrations and of course that's
because of its history
and where americans come from americans
don't really share a common
religious or historical or
real cultural background because
americans really are from all over the
world right there's different ways of
immigration
different periods of course europeans
were the
first and probably and of course
dominant group in america
but successive waves of immigration you
know there are people from all over the
world
living in america and they all consider
themselves americans
to become american is very easy uh
you'd well maybe easy depending on on
how you feel about it
but of course you have to pass a
citizenship test
and you have to be in the country for a
certain amount of time
but it is comparatively easy to become
an american
than it is to become a citizen in many
other countries so
uh and a lot of people have done so in
the past and continue to do so now
so america is constantly evolving and
there are many different types of
celebrations
and observances in america anyway
that wraps up this lesson hope you
learned a lot kind of interesting
thinking about all these different
celebrations
and thanks for staying with me we'll see
you next in the next lesson
take care everybody bye-bye

05:38
a party to rejoice
05:40

and the first main idea is that there
09:00
are many different types of holidays we
09:02
have religious celebrations and we have
09:04
national celebrations national
09:06
celebrations are on the top
09:09
and whoops on the top and religious
09:12
celebrations
09:13
are on the bottom so of course there's
09:15
many different types of celebrations in
09:17
america
09:18
now national celebrations these kind of
09:21
honor the history
09:23
of america and they're important to
09:26
americans
09:28
because of their history basically
09:30
memorial day is a good example
09:31
memorial day is a day in which americans
09:35
honor the people the men and women who
09:38
died while fighting wars for america
09:42
it's interesting memorial day was
09:43
actually started after the civil war
09:46
in america and it honors both the north
09:49
and the south
09:50
soldiers who died while fighting the
09:52
civil war because of course they're all
09:54
american soldiers
09:55
and the special day was set aside to
09:57
honor those men
09:59
who died while fighting now veterans day
10:02
also honors soldiers but it is a day
10:06
to honor especially living soldiers
10:10
soldiers are men and women who served in
10:12
the armed forces
10:13
who are still alive but it's a
10:15
expression of thanks for their service
10:18
and veterans day was established after
10:20
world war one
10:21
many americans died in world war one it
10:23
was a terrible war they called it the
10:25
great war
10:26
and after that war they established a
10:28
veterans day
10:29
to honor those men who went overseas and
10:32
fought
10:32
in europe for democracy
10:36
in that war then we have thanksgiving
10:39
day thanksgiving day doesn't have to do
10:41
with soldiers or wars
10:42
it has to do with the very early
10:46
history of america before america was
10:49
even a country
10:51
english settlers coming over to what is
10:53
now america
10:54
had a very difficult time because they
10:57
weren't
10:57
used to the environmental conditions it
11:01
was different environmental conditions
11:03
than what they were used to and of
11:04
course they were far away from
11:06
what they what their own civilization it
11:09
was hard to get supplies
11:11
things that they were familiar with and
11:13
comfortable with
11:14
so the first few years while they
11:18
struggled to survive when they had a
11:20
good harvest
11:21
in the fall they celebrated and they
11:23
want to give thanks to their god
11:25
so that was that's thanksgiving day it's
11:28
a time of giving thanks
11:30
for being able to survive and having a
11:32
good harvest
11:33
in a new and difficult environment a new
11:36
and difficult land
11:37
so that's thanksgiving day and nowadays
11:39
we celebrate it in
11:41
november and it's usually the third
11:43
weekend in november the third thursday
11:45
and it's a big holiday we have thursday
11:48
and usually friday off
11:49
and the whole family gets together and
11:51
has a big turkey dinner
11:53
okay to celebrate good harvest and also
11:55
to express
11:56
thanks for the good things in our lives
11:59
those are national celebrations we also
12:02
have religious celebrations and of
12:04
course
12:05
americans have come from all corners of
12:07
the earth
12:08
and they bring their religions with them
12:10
of course we have christmas
12:13
christmas celebrates the birth of jesus
12:15
christ
12:16
however it's not just christians who
12:18
celebrate christmas in america
12:20
christmas in america has become more of
12:22
a a holiday
12:24
for everybody and some people uh you
12:27
know just
12:27
they just concentrate on santa claus or
12:30
exchanging presents
12:31
and it's really a holiday where people
12:34
exchange
12:34
presents uh for each other and of course
12:37
it's rooted in christian
12:39
uh tradition uh to celebrate the birth
12:41
of jesus but as you know the story
12:43
the three wise men came from the east
12:45
and they were giving gifts to jesus
12:47
so nowadays people celebrate by giving
12:49
gifts to each other
12:50
and it's more it's not just a christian
12:52
holiday anymore it's more of kind of a
12:54
it's almost a national holiday nowadays
12:56
because whether
12:57
people are christian or not they do
12:59
celebrate christmas
13:00
uh in this way then we have ramadan
13:03
ramadan is a whole month long
13:06
and it's a month long to recognize the
13:09
lunar
13:09
calendar it's based on the lunar
13:11
calendar not the solar calendar
13:14
so the time of ramadan might change but
13:16
muslims celebrate it
13:18
and to observe ramadan they do not
13:21
eat or drink anything when the sun
13:24
is in the sky after the sun goes down
13:27
then they can eat
13:28
so it's a little difficult living
13:31
through ramadan unless you were a night
13:33
owl
13:33
and you sleep during the day so that's
13:36
ramadan
13:37
and then of course the jewish holiday or
13:39
one of the jewish holidays is
13:41
passover and passover celebrates a very
13:44
old story of an angel coming
13:48
through a town in biblical times and
13:51
killing the firstborn sons and the
13:53
jewish people
13:54
marked their doors so the angel wouldn't
13:56
visit them and leave their family alone
13:59
so that's a very old story too but it's
14:01
a religious holiday as well
14:03
and jewish people will celebrate that
14:06
as their religious celebration so like i
14:09
said
14:10
these are just three examples of many
14:12
religious celebrations in america
14:14
and of course there are many different
14:16
kinds because again
14:18
america is a nation of immigrants many
14:20
people bringing their religion
14:21
with them when they come to america
14:28
okay
14:30
okay now let's do the reading together
14:33
and as usual i'll read it out loud
14:35
please repeat after me focus on
14:37
pronunciation
14:39
and also focus on the words that we
14:41
learned in the vocabulary section
14:44
are you ready here we go
14:47
in the u.s people celebrate
14:50
many different kinds of festivals
14:54
and religious holidays
14:57
in my town each year on memorial day
15:01
and veterans day we celebrate
15:04
patriots
15:07
we try to remember what they did
15:10
for our country this is a time
15:14
when we enjoy watching a street parade
15:17
with
15:17
bands and performers
15:21
on thanksgiving day my family enjoys
15:25
a delicious feast together
15:28
in the evening we watch the fireworks
15:31
show
15:32
and sing songs together
15:37
easter and christmas are christian
15:40
religious celebrations in the u.s
15:44
muslim people celebrate ramadan
15:48
and jewish people celebrate passover
15:54
during important festivals and
15:57
celebrations
15:58
people spend time with family and do not
16:03
go to work
16:07
they want to have a good time with their
16:09
families
16:11
sometimes an important person gives a
16:14
speech
16:15
celebrations are a fun time to enjoy
16:18
music food and family
16:24
okay so how is this reading passage
16:27
organized
16:28
it is organized under the organizational
16:31
model
16:31
classify and as we saw when we looked at
16:34
the main ideas
16:35
of course there are many different types
16:37
of celebrations or
16:38
holidays in america there are national
16:42
national religious and cultural
16:46
celebrations so we're classifying
16:49
different types
16:50
what type of celebration is each one
16:54
first of all we have memorial day and
16:56
veterans day
16:57
those two are very similar right because
17:00
they honor soldiers
17:01
who fought in wars
17:04
so what are they we celebrate
17:08
we celebrate what who are the people the
17:10
soldiers
17:11
that fought in these wars what do we
17:13
call them remember the vocabulary word
17:15
we celebrate patriots pay
17:19
tree uts so we celebrate
17:23
patriots make sure my tea is crossed
17:25
okay there we go patriots
17:27
we enjoy watching a street parade this
17:30
is a type of
17:31
national holiday so we celebrate
17:33
patriots we enjoy watching a street
17:35
parade
17:36
next we have peep and christmas they are
17:39
christian celebrations so which two
17:42
celebrations do we talk about
17:44
that are celebrated by christians well
17:46
of course there's christmas the
17:48
the birth of jesus but also what other
17:51
holiday did i mention
17:52
i mentioned easter right easter is also
17:56
a christian holiday
17:58
easter so easter and christmas
18:02
are christian celebrations we classify
18:04
those
18:05
as christian celebrations not national
18:07
celebrations
18:08
christian celebrations types of
18:10
religious celebrations
18:12
we also have two more types of religious
18:15
celebrations but they aren't christian
18:17
uh they are different and those are the
18:19
blanks okay we have ramadan
18:21
and passover so who celebrates
18:25
ramadan as i said before
18:28
muslim people celebrate ramadan
18:31
muslim mus lim
18:35
so when we talk about muslims muslims
18:37
refer to the people
18:39
islam refers to the religion
18:42
so don't get confused by that sometimes
18:44
people get confused there
18:45
so islam is the religion muslim
18:48
is the person who practices islam or
18:51
believes in
18:52
islam so muslim people celebrate ramadan
18:56
and of course muslim we don't put
18:58
muslims s
19:00
because here muslim is an adjective
19:02
people
19:03
is the noun so we wouldn't put s on
19:06
muslim okay so muslim people celebrate
19:10
ramadan
19:10
and what religion what religious
19:14
group celebrates passover it would be
19:17
jewish and again we don't put jewish is
19:20
right we don't put
19:20
s on jewish because so jewish
19:25
jewish people celebrate passover because
19:27
again jewish is an adjective
19:29
and people is the noun so muslim people
19:32
jewish people
19:33
muslim people celebrate ramadan and
19:35
jewish people celebrate
19:37
passover and christian people celebrate
19:40
christmas of course you can say
19:42
christians celebrate
19:44
christmas jews celebrate passover and
19:48
muslims
19:49
celebrate ramadan so it depends on how
19:51
you construct
19:52
your sentences okay well
19:56
that is our lesson as you can see we in
19:58
this lesson we learned about many
20:00
different types of celebrations
20:01
and as i said before i'll say it again
20:03
america has lots of different kinds of
20:06
celebrations and of course that's
20:08
because of its history
20:09
and where americans come from americans
20:12
don't really share a common
20:16
religious or historical or
20:20
real cultural background because
20:24
americans really are from all over the
20:25
world right there's different ways of
20:28
immigration
20:28
different periods of course europeans
20:31
were the
20:31
first and probably and of course
20:34
dominant group in america
20:36
but successive waves of immigration you
20:38
know there are people from all over the
20:40
world
20:40
living in america and they all consider
20:43
themselves americans
20:44
to become american is very easy uh
20:47
you'd well maybe easy depending on on
20:50
how you feel about it
20:51
but of course you have to pass a
20:53
citizenship test
20:55
and you have to be in the country for a
20:58
certain amount of time
20:59
but it is comparatively easy to become
21:02
an american
21:03
than it is to become a citizen in many
21:05
other countries so
21:06
uh and a lot of people have done so in
21:09
the past and continue to do so now
21:11
so america is constantly evolving and
21:13
there are many different types of
21:15
celebrations
21:16
and observances in america anyway
21:19
that wraps up this lesson hope you
21:21
learned a lot kind of interesting
21:22
thinking about all these different
21:24
celebrations
21:25
and thanks for staying with me we'll see
21:27
you next in the next lesson
21:29
take care everybody bye-bye
