hello everybody
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
are you interested in
continuing our subject here we're of
course on unit four
we're talking about world connections so
it's very interesting
looking at different places around the
world and also thinking about
how people have traveled from place to
place
in lesson 11 we're talking about a quick
bite to eat
so we're not going to be focusing on
transportation we're going to be talking
about
fast food because of course
in our lives as we're very busy
traveling from place to place it's very
easy to get
food very quickly and we're talking
about fast food
in this section so that will be our
reading passage but again of course we
need to study the vocabulary that we
will encounter
in the passage so let's begin the first
word
on our list today is a difficulty
or an issue so if you have a difficulty
or if there's some issue that you have
to deal with we
call that a problem problem now it's
very interesting because i'd like to
point out something
problem and issue have become
kind of not interchangeable but
substituted in america many people will
say
issue instead of saying
problem for example why because problem
is negative issue sounds more neutral
so for example americans instead of
saying
do you have a problem they will say is
there an
issue with this because do you have a
problem
is very direct and sounds negative
but if you change it and you say is
there an issue
with this whatever then that sounds more
neutral it doesn't sound
as rude and it doesn't sound as negative
so it's very interesting i've noticed
over maybe the last 10 or 20 years that
americans
have stopped using problem especially in
like polite situations like business
situations or things like that
people have stopped using problem and
they're starting to use the word
issue much more often because
problem sounds negative and problem is
negative if you have a problem with
something
that is a negative situation issue
though
can be sounds more neutral or not as
negative
okay next one two where and how
something began so we think about a game
like
chess or we think about a certain type
of dress or
a certain type of doing things where did
it begin
what was the origin origin
where did it start where did it begin
that's the origin how
and where something began number three
able to be used or taken able to be used
or taken
we say it's available if
there is a seat empty in a restaurant
you can say
is this seat available can i sit there
can i use it can i take it
if you go somewhere and you want to be
able to
use a piece of equipment for example you
go to a bowling alley
and there's some shoes on the shelf are
they available yes you can use those
shoes to go
bowling right so are they available you
can use them or you can take them
it is available next one
to ask for an item or meal from
a business when you go to the restaurant
and you
ask for an item or you ask for a meal
right what are you doing what do you
it's called an order i think you say in
korean jumun jumun haseo
have you ordered have you ordered
uh would you like to order or uh
if i'm a waiter right i say to the
customer would you like to order
are you ready to order now if i'm the
customer i say excuse me
i would like to order now this is my
order
okay so order you ask for an item or a
meal from a business
not just in a restaurant item if you're
online you're doing internet shopping
then you also can order products from a
business
order an item some type of product so
that we say order that's a specific
verb for that action five
easy and quick to do law is very
convenient that word just kind of slid
right on in there
very conveniently right it was easy and
quick to do
it's convenient modern life is very
convenient isn't it
we just hit some keys on our keyboard
and somebody comes to our door
and gives us a package wow how
convenient is that
we don't even have to leave our house
anymore to get
items from the store okay next one
possibly dangerous not joking
these two men do they look happy
well no they don't look happy doesn't
look like their team of course
they're dressed very funnily they're
sports fans obviously
but they don't look happy they look very
serious
they're not joking and
it says possibly dangerous but i don't
want to say that these guys are possibly
dangerous
but other situations can be described as
serious for example
conditions outside weather conditions
are serious
that could be possibly dangerous if you
hear that on the news be careful
if the tv or the radio announcer says
weather conditions are serious that
means there's a lot of snow maybe
there's
ice or maybe there's a lot of rain and
there's a possibility of flooding
it could be dangerous so there are
serious weather conditions outside
but sirius doesn't always mean dangerous
it can mean but like these guys
they're not joking they're not happy
they're thinking about something very
hard
they're very serious but i wouldn't say
these guys are dangerous
okay it depends on the situation okay
next one
taking almost no time to make what is
this of course that's
ramyan right it takes almost no time to
make
in america people will usually say
instant instant
ramen or another word for ramyun is
instant
noodles okay but we use the word instant
because it takes almost no time to make
now a long time ago when you if you
wanted to have noodle soup
you had to take a lot of time you had to
buy the noodles
you had to cook them boil them for a
long time
you know with water and then go and get
other spices and put that in
it took a while to make that but with
instant ramen
all you do is heat water pour the water
in there
keep it closed for about a minute open
it up and eat it
it's almost no time to make you don't
have to worry it's already pre-packaged
it's already prepared for you okay so
it's very
instant you can make it very quickly
instant
eight throughout the world so something
that is spread throughout the world
is world wide and we
use this uh suffix this ending for
the word uh quite a bit right world wide
company wide throughout the entire
company
region wide nationwide
throughout the region throughout the
nation and of course we're talking about
the whole world
worldwide so why it is a common ending
especially at the end of it some type of
area nation region company
and when you're talking about an area to
mean that it's throughout the entire
area throughout the world throughout the
company throughout the nation
worldwide company-wide nationwide
okay
are you hungry this looks like a good
snack and it's a healthy snack too isn't
it
it's a fruit that comes from tropical
countries like the philippines
thailand especially hawaii right hawaii
has specialized in growing these right
what is it what kind of fruit
it's a pineapple pine
apple of course they're not apples that
grow on pine trees
a different kind of tree right i'm not
sure where the word pineapple came from
but it's a special kind of fruit that
grows in tropical countries
pineapple good good snack
good food for a snack okay next one a
liquid that goes with another food
so a lot of foods that you eat
especially if you go to like a
restaurant like tgi
fridays or some other place like that
and you have chicken wings
they usually have some other it's like a
liquid it's a very
thick liquid right it's not a liquid
it's not like water
although some can be thin it's called a
sauce
a sauce usually they're kind of thick
and you dip your food into it
right a liquid that goes with goes with
another food so you either dip your
liquid into it or you pour it on top of
your meal
and that of course is a sauce next one
speed in action this person is
in a hurry in a
hurry so that's a common expression in
english
when somebody is moving quickly they're
walking quickly they're acting or you
can it doesn't even mean
they're moving from one place to another
you could be sitting at your desk
working quickly you are in a
hurry so in a hurry means to do
something quickly
or means to do something very fast
okay next one the amount of food eaten
for one meal
so if you only eat one of these bowls
and that's your entire meal
we call that a serving one
serving usually people will say i will
well
it's actually not usually let's just say
i'll have
the steak and fries that's one serving
of a steak and fries
or i'll have a bowl of soup that's one
serving
if you want two servings that means you
have another bowl of soup
so one serving two servings there are
two servings here
so the amount of food eaten for one meal
okay sometimes people will have a lot of
servings for their meal right but it's a
serving
okay it's typical but some people are so
hungry they want more than the typical
amount so they have
another serving okay
13. a business that has many copies
of its stores of course you guys know
mcdonald's mcdonald's is everywhere
right they're in almost every i think
they're in
every country except for north korea but
they're almost everywhere in the world
right
a business that has many copies of its
stores we call mcdonald's a chain
store and there are many types of chain
stores of course mcdonald's is perhaps
the most famous one because it's the
most popular one
but there's other different restaurants
i mentioned tgi fridays
before tj friday's is a chain restaurant
outback is a chain restaurant
but it's not just restaurants it can
also be stores
right for example you could have like
macy's
macy's could be a chain store in
different in different cities
right because they're a large department
store they're not just in new york
there are also many other cities in
america
so a department store could be a chain
store
lots of different businesses that have
uh shops
in different areas or different regions
they are also called
chain stores okay the next word here
is kind of funny cow meat now of course
we don't say cow meat
in america that's a very strange word
it's kind of like saying
pada gogi for fish right that sounds
weird no
you say bulgogi or you say sangsan right
so you have special words for different
types of meat
and if you i mean if you say cow meat in
america
people will understand they'll just
think oh that sounds funny
it's like me going into a restaurant and
saying yes i would like some pada gogi
please the restaurant people
will probably understand what i mean but
they'll think well this american is
strange you
know some weird korean right so don't go
to america and say i'd like some cow
meat
right say you would like some beef right
so gogi
is beef in english okay okay next one is
15
what you put on top of food so things
that you put on top of food
especially on top of ice cream right
that's these are
uh probably things that you put on top
of ice cream you get hungry
we call them toppings right so
especially if you go to a place
like baskin robbins sometimes they'll
have different toppings on your ice
cream
but especially cold stone near the cold
stone ice cream
chain store they have many different
toppings
that you can put on your food it's not
just ice cream
again it could be a meal it could be
steak it could be
pasta what is the topping that you put
on especially
pizza when you think about pizza has
many different toppings
and you choose which topping you want
on your food next one is 16
made ready to use before it's needed so
if you make something
now but you don't need it now you need
it an hour from now
or you need it maybe tomorrow what do
you do
it's prepared you prepare that food
so after you prepare it it is prepared
and by the way it's not just food okay
you could prepare other things for
example you could prepare your homework
the night before it's due is your
homework done yes it's prepared
for tomorrow so something that's
prepared is made
ready to use before it's needed
the teacher doesn't need your homework
at 10 o'clock at night
right the teacher needs your homework
the next morning but you should prepare
it the night before
so it's done your mother does the same
thing when she cooks meals right
many moms will will prepare meals
they'll put them in the refrigerator
and then take them out and warm them up
for the dinner because
many moms are busy these days sometimes
though they'll prepare
a meal for a few hours before dinner
time
right so they might start cooking at 4
p.m
but you don't eat until 6 right so
that's prepared they prepared the meal
for you
ok let's go over the words
what what are the words that we've just
learned how well do you remember them
let's go over the exercises
the first one number one i beep a new
sweater
it will come in the mail soon it will
come
in the mail soon so if what do you do
you know a new sweater could be anything
really but you it'll come in the mail
soon what word did we
talk about that would fit here a grabbed
b made c ordered d sold
well a grab just means to go and grab
something if you grabbed a new sweater
it's not going to come in the mail soon
you have it in your hand you grabbed it
right
so and you shouldn't grab things that's
not polite
okay so not grabbed b i made a new
sweater if you made this sweater you
have it right it's not going to come in
the mail you have it now
so made doesn't fit i ordered a new
sweater
ah that makes sense right you ordered
the sweater on the computer
or you order it on the phone and then
the company will send it to you
in the mail so that's the answer i
ordered a new sweater
it will come in the mail soon what about
d
i sold a new sweater i sold a new
sweater that doesn't make sense because
it will come if you sell a sweater
you're going to send it through the mail
it's not going to come to you
you're going to send it away so that
doesn't make sense okay
number three i'm sorry but we have no
tables
beep okay remember when we talked about
this word i use the example of the chair
if there is a chair that is empty that
you can
use it right it is what well the same
thing about a table
you go into a restaurant and there is an
empty table right
nobody is sitting there then that table
is what
but if you go in the restaurant the
waiter says i'm sorry but we have
no tables for your use
no tables out no tables instant no table
serious or no tables
available well right away we can see
available
i'm sorry but we have no tables
available
no tables are ready for your use not
out not instant that doesn't make sense
and not we have no tables that are
serious that's just silly right
so i'm sorry but we have no tables
available this one we see right away
uh no tables that are ready for your use
no tables available six
that was a beep test i don't know
it would be so hard and of course we
have a or an
because some of the answers start with
about one answer starts with a vowel
so what was it that was a what kind of
test or what kind of test
is a hard test what kind of test is a
hard
test a difficult test
right um a quick test no
hard tests are not quick um b
a convenient test convenient means easy
so that's not true it's a hard test
it's an instant test instant and quick
are similar right but that doesn't make
sense
it was a serious yeah it was a serious
test it was difficult
remember serious doesn't always mean
dangerous a test
cannot be dangerous but it can be
very difficult or severe right
serious it can be a serious test that
teacher is not joking around the teacher
is very
serious about us learning the material
so that was a serious test it was a
difficult test
seven don't forget
right don't forget dogs had their beep
as wolves now this one is interesting
you have to think about this a little
bit
but what you need to know of course and
i mentioned this in a previous lesson a
long time ago
all dogs all modern dogs now
came from wolves right so
all modern dogs descended from wolves so
you think about your your dog at home
right whether it's a beagle or it's a
husky
a big dog you know their ancestors
were wolves a long time ago there were
no dogs that people had as pets
there were wolves and all those wolves
their babies
after many generations evolved into
different types
of dogs dogs that people have in their
homes
so dogs had their what as wolves as
their future
had their origin had their problem or
had their mistake
well remember how and where some or how
and when or where
something got started is their origin
how did dogs come about well their
origin
is wolves right after thousands of years
of breeding
human beings have helped wolves
or helped wolves or made wolves evolve
into
dogs right so the origin but all dogs
came from wolves so
dogs origin is wolves not future that
doesn't make sense
not problem that's weird and mistake
problem and mistake are similar
but they don't fit here the best word of
course is origin
all modern dogs had their origin as
wolves
very interesting okay well that wraps up
the vocabulary part of this lesson let's
take a short break we'll come back and
let's go over the reading passage
together so don't go away

hello everybody
00:09
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
00:12
are you interested in
00:13
continuing our subject here we're of
00:15
course on unit four
00:17
we're talking about world connections so
00:20
it's very interesting
00:21
looking at different places around the
00:23
world and also thinking about
00:24
how people have traveled from place to
00:27
place
00:28
in lesson 11 we're talking about a quick
00:31
bite to eat
00:32
so we're not going to be focusing on
00:34
transportation we're going to be talking
00:35
about
00:36
fast food because of course
00:39
in our lives as we're very busy
00:42
traveling from place to place it's very
00:44
easy to get
00:45
food very quickly and we're talking
00:46
about fast food
00:48
in this section so that will be our
00:50
reading passage but again of course we
00:52
need to study the vocabulary that we
00:54
will encounter
00:55
in the passage so let's begin the first
00:58
word
00:58
on our list today is a difficulty
01:02
or an issue so if you have a difficulty
01:06
or if there's some issue that you have
01:07
to deal with we
01:09
call that a problem problem now it's
01:12
very interesting because i'd like to
01:13
point out something
01:14
problem and issue have become
01:19
kind of not interchangeable but
01:22
substituted in america many people will
01:25
say
01:26
issue instead of saying
01:29
problem for example why because problem
01:33
is negative issue sounds more neutral
01:36
so for example americans instead of
01:39
saying
01:40
do you have a problem they will say is
01:43
there an
01:43
issue with this because do you have a
01:46
problem
01:46
is very direct and sounds negative
01:50
but if you change it and you say is
01:53
there an issue
01:54
with this whatever then that sounds more
01:57
neutral it doesn't sound
01:59
as rude and it doesn't sound as negative
02:03
so it's very interesting i've noticed
02:05
over maybe the last 10 or 20 years that
02:08
americans
02:09
have stopped using problem especially in
02:12
like polite situations like business
02:14
situations or things like that
02:16
people have stopped using problem and
02:18
they're starting to use the word
02:19
issue much more often because
02:22
problem sounds negative and problem is
02:24
negative if you have a problem with
02:26
something
02:27
that is a negative situation issue
02:30
though
02:30
can be sounds more neutral or not as
02:33
negative
02:34
okay next one two where and how
02:38
something began so we think about a game
02:40
like
02:41
chess or we think about a certain type
02:43
of dress or
02:44
a certain type of doing things where did
02:47
it begin
02:48
what was the origin origin
02:51
where did it start where did it begin
02:54
that's the origin how
02:56
and where something began number three
03:00
able to be used or taken able to be used
03:03
or taken
03:04
we say it's available if
03:07
there is a seat empty in a restaurant
03:10
you can say
03:11
is this seat available can i sit there
03:13
can i use it can i take it
03:16
if you go somewhere and you want to be
03:18
able to
03:19
use a piece of equipment for example you
03:22
go to a bowling alley
03:23
and there's some shoes on the shelf are
03:25
they available yes you can use those
03:28
shoes to go
03:28
bowling right so are they available you
03:31
can use them or you can take them
03:33
it is available next one
03:36
to ask for an item or meal from
03:39
a business when you go to the restaurant
03:42
and you
03:42
ask for an item or you ask for a meal
03:46
right what are you doing what do you
03:48
it's called an order i think you say in
03:50
korean jumun jumun haseo
03:52
have you ordered have you ordered
03:55
uh would you like to order or uh
03:59
if i'm a waiter right i say to the
04:00
customer would you like to order
04:02
are you ready to order now if i'm the
04:05
customer i say excuse me
04:06
i would like to order now this is my
04:09
order
04:10
okay so order you ask for an item or a
04:13
meal from a business
04:15
not just in a restaurant item if you're
04:18
online you're doing internet shopping
04:20
then you also can order products from a
04:23
business
04:23
order an item some type of product so
04:26
that we say order that's a specific
04:28
verb for that action five
04:32
easy and quick to do law is very
04:33
convenient that word just kind of slid
04:35
right on in there
04:36
very conveniently right it was easy and
04:39
quick to do
04:40
it's convenient modern life is very
04:43
convenient isn't it
04:45
we just hit some keys on our keyboard
04:47
and somebody comes to our door
04:49
and gives us a package wow how
04:52
convenient is that
04:53
we don't even have to leave our house
04:55
anymore to get
04:56
items from the store okay next one
05:00
possibly dangerous not joking
05:03
these two men do they look happy
05:06
well no they don't look happy doesn't
05:08
look like their team of course
05:10
they're dressed very funnily they're
05:11
sports fans obviously
05:13
but they don't look happy they look very
05:15
serious
05:17
they're not joking and
05:20
it says possibly dangerous but i don't
05:21
want to say that these guys are possibly
05:23
dangerous
05:24
but other situations can be described as
05:28
serious for example
05:30
conditions outside weather conditions
05:32
are serious
05:33
that could be possibly dangerous if you
05:35
hear that on the news be careful
05:37
if the tv or the radio announcer says
05:40
weather conditions are serious that
05:42
means there's a lot of snow maybe
05:43
there's
05:43
ice or maybe there's a lot of rain and
05:46
there's a possibility of flooding
05:48
it could be dangerous so there are
05:49
serious weather conditions outside
05:52
but sirius doesn't always mean dangerous
05:54
it can mean but like these guys
05:56
they're not joking they're not happy
05:58
they're thinking about something very
06:00
hard
06:01
they're very serious but i wouldn't say
06:03
these guys are dangerous
06:05
okay it depends on the situation okay
06:08
next one
06:09
taking almost no time to make what is
06:12
this of course that's
06:13
ramyan right it takes almost no time to
06:16
make
06:17
in america people will usually say
06:19
instant instant
06:20
ramen or another word for ramyun is
06:23
instant
06:24
noodles okay but we use the word instant
06:27
because it takes almost no time to make
06:31
now a long time ago when you if you
06:33
wanted to have noodle soup
06:35
you had to take a lot of time you had to
06:37
buy the noodles
06:38
you had to cook them boil them for a
06:40
long time
06:41
you know with water and then go and get
06:43
other spices and put that in
06:44
it took a while to make that but with
06:47
instant ramen
06:48
all you do is heat water pour the water
06:51
in there
06:52
keep it closed for about a minute open
06:54
it up and eat it
06:55
it's almost no time to make you don't
06:57
have to worry it's already pre-packaged
07:00
it's already prepared for you okay so
07:03
it's very
07:03
instant you can make it very quickly
07:06
instant
07:07
eight throughout the world so something
07:10
that is spread throughout the world
07:12
is world wide and we
07:16
use this uh suffix this ending for
07:19
the word uh quite a bit right world wide
07:23
company wide throughout the entire
07:26
company
07:27
region wide nationwide
07:30
throughout the region throughout the
07:31
nation and of course we're talking about
07:33
the whole world
07:34
worldwide so why it is a common ending
07:38
especially at the end of it some type of
07:40
area nation region company
07:42
and when you're talking about an area to
07:45
mean that it's throughout the entire
07:47
area throughout the world throughout the
07:49
company throughout the nation
07:51
worldwide company-wide nationwide
07:55
okay
07:58
are you hungry this looks like a good
08:00
snack and it's a healthy snack too isn't
08:03
it
08:03
it's a fruit that comes from tropical
08:05
countries like the philippines
08:07
thailand especially hawaii right hawaii
08:11
has specialized in growing these right
08:14
what is it what kind of fruit
08:15
it's a pineapple pine
08:18
apple of course they're not apples that
08:20
grow on pine trees
08:23
a different kind of tree right i'm not
08:25
sure where the word pineapple came from
08:27
but it's a special kind of fruit that
08:29
grows in tropical countries
08:32
pineapple good good snack
08:35
good food for a snack okay next one a
08:38
liquid that goes with another food
08:40
so a lot of foods that you eat
08:42
especially if you go to like a
08:43
restaurant like tgi
08:44
fridays or some other place like that
08:46
and you have chicken wings
08:48
they usually have some other it's like a
08:51
liquid it's a very
08:52
thick liquid right it's not a liquid
08:55
it's not like water
08:56
although some can be thin it's called a
08:59
sauce
09:00
a sauce usually they're kind of thick
09:02
and you dip your food into it
09:04
right a liquid that goes with goes with
09:07
another food so you either dip your
09:09
liquid into it or you pour it on top of
09:11
your meal
09:13
and that of course is a sauce next one
09:17
speed in action this person is
09:20
in a hurry in a
09:24
hurry so that's a common expression in
09:27
english
09:28
when somebody is moving quickly they're
09:31
walking quickly they're acting or you
09:33
can it doesn't even mean
09:34
they're moving from one place to another
09:36
you could be sitting at your desk
09:38
working quickly you are in a
09:41
hurry so in a hurry means to do
09:44
something quickly
09:45
or means to do something very fast
09:48
okay next one the amount of food eaten
09:51
for one meal
09:53
so if you only eat one of these bowls
09:55
and that's your entire meal
09:57
we call that a serving one
10:00
serving usually people will say i will
10:04
well
10:04
it's actually not usually let's just say
10:07
i'll have
10:08
the steak and fries that's one serving
10:11
of a steak and fries
10:12
or i'll have a bowl of soup that's one
10:15
serving
10:16
if you want two servings that means you
10:18
have another bowl of soup
10:21
so one serving two servings there are
10:23
two servings here
10:25
so the amount of food eaten for one meal
10:28
okay sometimes people will have a lot of
10:32
servings for their meal right but it's a
10:33
serving
10:34
okay it's typical but some people are so
10:36
hungry they want more than the typical
10:38
amount so they have
10:39
another serving okay
10:43
13. a business that has many copies
10:46
of its stores of course you guys know
10:48
mcdonald's mcdonald's is everywhere
10:50
right they're in almost every i think
10:51
they're in
10:52
every country except for north korea but
10:54
they're almost everywhere in the world
10:56
right
10:57
a business that has many copies of its
10:59
stores we call mcdonald's a chain
11:02
store and there are many types of chain
11:04
stores of course mcdonald's is perhaps
11:06
the most famous one because it's the
11:08
most popular one
11:09
but there's other different restaurants
11:11
i mentioned tgi fridays
11:13
before tj friday's is a chain restaurant
11:16
outback is a chain restaurant
11:17
but it's not just restaurants it can
11:19
also be stores
11:21
right for example you could have like
11:24
macy's
11:24
macy's could be a chain store in
11:26
different in different cities
11:28
right because they're a large department
11:30
store they're not just in new york
11:31
there are also many other cities in
11:33
america
11:35
so a department store could be a chain
11:36
store
11:38
lots of different businesses that have
11:41
uh shops
11:42
in different areas or different regions
11:44
they are also called
11:45
chain stores okay the next word here
11:48
is kind of funny cow meat now of course
11:51
we don't say cow meat
11:52
in america that's a very strange word
11:54
it's kind of like saying
11:56
pada gogi for fish right that sounds
11:58
weird no
11:59
you say bulgogi or you say sangsan right
12:02
so you have special words for different
12:04
types of meat
12:05
and if you i mean if you say cow meat in
12:08
america
12:08
people will understand they'll just
12:10
think oh that sounds funny
12:11
it's like me going into a restaurant and
12:14
saying yes i would like some pada gogi
12:16
please the restaurant people
12:17
will probably understand what i mean but
12:19
they'll think well this american is
12:20
strange you
12:21
know some weird korean right so don't go
12:23
to america and say i'd like some cow
12:25
meat
12:25
right say you would like some beef right
12:28
so gogi
12:29
is beef in english okay okay next one is
12:33
15
12:34
what you put on top of food so things
12:36
that you put on top of food
12:38
especially on top of ice cream right
12:41
that's these are
12:42
uh probably things that you put on top
12:44
of ice cream you get hungry
12:46
we call them toppings right so
12:48
especially if you go to a place
12:50
like baskin robbins sometimes they'll
12:52
have different toppings on your ice
12:54
cream
12:54
but especially cold stone near the cold
12:57
stone ice cream
12:58
chain store they have many different
13:01
toppings
13:02
that you can put on your food it's not
13:03
just ice cream
13:05
again it could be a meal it could be
13:07
steak it could be
13:09
pasta what is the topping that you put
13:11
on especially
13:12
pizza when you think about pizza has
13:14
many different toppings
13:15
and you choose which topping you want
13:19
on your food next one is 16
13:22
made ready to use before it's needed so
13:25
if you make something
13:27
now but you don't need it now you need
13:30
it an hour from now
13:31
or you need it maybe tomorrow what do
13:33
you do
13:34
it's prepared you prepare that food
13:38
so after you prepare it it is prepared
13:41
and by the way it's not just food okay
13:44
you could prepare other things for
13:46
example you could prepare your homework
13:49
the night before it's due is your
13:51
homework done yes it's prepared
13:53
for tomorrow so something that's
13:56
prepared is made
13:57
ready to use before it's needed
14:01
the teacher doesn't need your homework
14:03
at 10 o'clock at night
14:05
right the teacher needs your homework
14:06
the next morning but you should prepare
14:09
it the night before
14:11
so it's done your mother does the same
14:13
thing when she cooks meals right
14:15
many moms will will prepare meals
14:17
they'll put them in the refrigerator
14:19
and then take them out and warm them up
14:21
for the dinner because
14:22
many moms are busy these days sometimes
14:25
though they'll prepare
14:26
a meal for a few hours before dinner
14:29
time
14:30
right so they might start cooking at 4
14:32
p.m
14:33
but you don't eat until 6 right so
14:36
that's prepared they prepared the meal
14:38
for you
14:39
ok let's go over the words
14:42
what what are the words that we've just
14:44
learned how well do you remember them
14:46
let's go over the exercises
14:48
the first one number one i beep a new
14:51
sweater
14:52
it will come in the mail soon it will
14:54
come
14:55
in the mail soon so if what do you do
14:59
you know a new sweater could be anything
15:01
really but you it'll come in the mail
15:03
soon what word did we
15:05
talk about that would fit here a grabbed
15:08
b made c ordered d sold
15:12
well a grab just means to go and grab
15:14
something if you grabbed a new sweater
15:17
it's not going to come in the mail soon
15:18
you have it in your hand you grabbed it
15:20
right
15:20
so and you shouldn't grab things that's
15:23
not polite
15:24
okay so not grabbed b i made a new
15:27
sweater if you made this sweater you
15:28
have it right it's not going to come in
15:30
the mail you have it now
15:31
so made doesn't fit i ordered a new
15:34
sweater
15:35
ah that makes sense right you ordered
15:37
the sweater on the computer
15:39
or you order it on the phone and then
15:41
the company will send it to you
15:42
in the mail so that's the answer i
15:45
ordered a new sweater
15:46
it will come in the mail soon what about
15:49
d
15:49
i sold a new sweater i sold a new
15:52
sweater that doesn't make sense because
15:54
it will come if you sell a sweater
15:56
you're going to send it through the mail
15:57
it's not going to come to you
15:59
you're going to send it away so that
16:00
doesn't make sense okay
16:03
number three i'm sorry but we have no
16:06
tables
16:07
beep okay remember when we talked about
16:09
this word i use the example of the chair
16:11
if there is a chair that is empty that
16:14
you can
16:15
use it right it is what well the same
16:17
thing about a table
16:18
you go into a restaurant and there is an
16:20
empty table right
16:22
nobody is sitting there then that table
16:25
is what
16:25
but if you go in the restaurant the
16:26
waiter says i'm sorry but we have
16:29
no tables for your use
16:32
no tables out no tables instant no table
16:35
serious or no tables
16:37
available well right away we can see
16:39
available
16:40
i'm sorry but we have no tables
16:42
available
16:43
no tables are ready for your use not
16:46
out not instant that doesn't make sense
16:50
and not we have no tables that are
16:52
serious that's just silly right
16:54
so i'm sorry but we have no tables
16:56
available this one we see right away
16:59
uh no tables that are ready for your use
17:02
no tables available six
17:06
that was a beep test i don't know
17:09
it would be so hard and of course we
17:10
have a or an
17:12
because some of the answers start with
17:14
about one answer starts with a vowel
17:16
so what was it that was a what kind of
17:19
test or what kind of test
17:21
is a hard test what kind of test is a
17:24
hard
17:24
test a difficult test
17:30
right um a quick test no
17:34
hard tests are not quick um b
17:37
a convenient test convenient means easy
17:40
so that's not true it's a hard test
17:42
it's an instant test instant and quick
17:44
are similar right but that doesn't make
17:46
sense
17:47
it was a serious yeah it was a serious
17:49
test it was difficult
17:51
remember serious doesn't always mean
17:53
dangerous a test
17:54
cannot be dangerous but it can be
17:58
very difficult or severe right
18:01
serious it can be a serious test that
18:04
teacher is not joking around the teacher
18:07
is very
18:08
serious about us learning the material
18:12
so that was a serious test it was a
18:14
difficult test
18:15
seven don't forget
18:19
right don't forget dogs had their beep
18:23
as wolves now this one is interesting
18:26
you have to think about this a little
18:28
bit
18:30
but what you need to know of course and
18:32
i mentioned this in a previous lesson a
18:33
long time ago
18:35
all dogs all modern dogs now
18:38
came from wolves right so
18:41
all modern dogs descended from wolves so
18:43
you think about your your dog at home
18:46
right whether it's a beagle or it's a
18:48
husky
18:49
a big dog you know their ancestors
18:52
were wolves a long time ago there were
18:54
no dogs that people had as pets
18:56
there were wolves and all those wolves
18:59
their babies
18:59
after many generations evolved into
19:02
different types
19:03
of dogs dogs that people have in their
19:07
homes
19:07
so dogs had their what as wolves as
19:10
their future
19:11
had their origin had their problem or
19:13
had their mistake
19:14
well remember how and where some or how
19:17
and when or where
19:18
something got started is their origin
19:21
how did dogs come about well their
19:23
origin
19:24
is wolves right after thousands of years
19:28
of breeding
19:29
human beings have helped wolves
19:32
or helped wolves or made wolves evolve
19:35
into
19:35
dogs right so the origin but all dogs
19:39
came from wolves so
19:40
dogs origin is wolves not future that
19:42
doesn't make sense
19:43
not problem that's weird and mistake
19:46
problem and mistake are similar
19:48
but they don't fit here the best word of
19:50
course is origin
19:51
all modern dogs had their origin as
19:54
wolves
19:55
very interesting okay well that wraps up
19:58
the vocabulary part of this lesson let's
20:00
take a short break we'll come back and
20:02
let's go over the reading passage
20:03
together so don't go away
20:23
[Music]
20:24
you
