[Music]
hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
we're taking a look at science book four
lesson four we're talking about the food
chain
is anybody hungry okay well in this
lesson we're going to discover
what a food chain is and we will also
talk about the difference between
prey and predator okay let's get started
as usual we start with the words the
vocabulary for this lesson
and the first word we have is
producer a producer is a living thing
that makes its own food so it can create
or make its own food by itself
the opposite of a producer is a consumer
a consumer is a living thing that cannot
make
its own food and that of course all
animals are consumers right
they will they need to find other things
to eat
predator a predator is an animal that
hunts
and eats other animal there's a good
picture right so we see a cheetah and
looks like a wild hog or wart hog
it's chasing if it catches it it will
eat that hog
so the cheetah of course is a predator
it will hunt and eat other animals
pray now again we say opposite right
uh producer consumer predator the
opposite of predator
is prey prey is the animal that is
hunted
and eaten by another animal in the
previous picture we saw a cheetah
chasing a warthog the cheetah was the
predator the warthog was the prey
in this picture we see an owl owls are
very strong
predators they're very they're very
fierce and they're very
um well like i almost said wise but yeah
they're smart
they're very good hunters and what are
they
what are they eating it looks like here
this is another bird
so they will eat birds but they're also
very famous for
uh eating mice and actually
many people like owls around because the
owls
will feed on the mice or the rats
meaning the mice will
you know get into places and eat a
farmer's crops or
or all the food in the barn or something
like that and
so it's good to have owls around to keep
the population of mice and rats
under control so owl is a prey
a prey animal and many different
i'm sorry an owl is a predator animal
and the prey is what the owl eats prey
is an animal that is hunted and
eaten by another animal in this picture
the smaller bird
is the prey so that's nature
okay next hunt we already saw this word
with the cheetah we saw this
the cheetah chasing the warthog right in
this case we have a cheetah
who has caught a gazelle or an
antelope and that's what cheetahs
and predators do they look for or chase
an animal
so as so as in order to
eat it so that's to hunt
and many animals hunt people hunt too
when you have
especially where i grew up in the west
american west
many people in the fall will take their
rifle go out into the woods and
hopefully
they'll shoot a deer or an elk
they get a permit for this of course
it's all very legal and you can't go out
and just shoot a deer
without a permit from the government but
they will hunt and uh hunting is kind of
a way of life especially in nature
so to hunt of course we hunt for
different things now too
right and you know if you're looking for
a great pair of shoes or
a nice outfit you might go to the
shopping mall and hunt
for your perfect clothes okay so we use
it for other
reasons as well food chain
now we talked about food chain i said
what is a food chain
i mentioned that at the beginning of
this lesson a food
chain is a line of living things that
depend on other living things for food
so we talked about predator and prey
right prey you know there's many types
of prey
and there's many types of predators and
usually
the smaller or the weaker animal
it is that's lower on the food chain
the stronger and
faster and bigger the animal
probably the higher up the food chain
it is so we have peop we have animals on
low on the food chain and we have
animals that are high
on the food chain now this is an
interesting picture it's a cartoon of
course and actually it's kind of a joke
don't be confused by this picture
because you can see something very
strange here and i noticed that on the
on the cover uh picture i mean it's it's
a cool picture
but it's just kind of funny because if
you notice this right here that is not
an
animal that's kind of a joke it's a
fisherman's joke
of course the fishermen it's a very
interesting picture
this line here of course is a fishing
line on the hook
you see a worm so worm of course is very
small and not very strong it's not
it's a very weak animal so it's on the
bottom of the food chain
and then of course a fish will come and
eat the eat the worm
and then a bigger fish will come and eat
the smaller fish so the bigger fish are
on the
higher end of the food chain but what in
the world is this thing that i circled
here
what is that if you look closely it
looks like an old
boot and that's like i said it's a
fisherman's joke a lot
you know when fishermen go fishing you
know sometimes the only thing they catch
are like old tires or uh pieces of
clothes
in this case sometimes fishermen like uh
they they catch something
oh my gosh i got a big fish and they
really work hard to pull it in
and it comes up and it's just an old
boot okay
so that's that's kind of a joke or a
fisherman's tail
and so the artist uh put this boot in
here with a mouth
going to eat the worm and then the fish
is going to eat the boot
so of course that's not real that that's
just a kind of a
fisherman's joke in the picture and when
you think about it
the the the the animal
that is on the top of this food chain is
not in the picture
what do i mean well here's the hook
right there
somebody put the worm on that hook right
so the fish will come and eat that worm
maybe a bigger fish will come and eat
that fish but who eats the big fish well
that's
the fisherman the fisherman is at the
top of the food chain
because they're going to catch they're
hunting the fish and they're going to
catch that fish
and have it for dinner hopefully they
won't eat the boot
okay okay that's just a joke okay next
caterpillar a caterpillar is a small
insect i'm sure you've probably seen
them
out and about in your garden in the
woods in the
parks nearby your house and they're
colorful sometimes they're colorful they
have little looks like hair sticking up
out of them
caterpillars and they just kind of move
along very slowly and they eat leaves
they're not very pretty are they they're
just kind of like a big worm with legs
but after a while they will turn into a
butterfly they will
change into a butterfly they'll make a
little cocoon
and after several days that cocoon will
open up
and a new it's the same animal but it's
a completely different
changed being and it has wings and it
flies around it's very pretty
okay shark a shark is a very large fish
that has
many teeth and a shark is a predator
because it has many teeth
it's very big it's very powerful and
be careful when you go swim not not
everywhere i mean you don't really have
to worry about sharks that often
uh just in areas that do have sharks be
uh careful about that know where you're
going if you're going to go to another
country or go swimming on the beach
just know you know if there's a shark
warning or not most places 99
uh beaches in the world you don't have
to worry but some places you do
so just keep an eye out listen to the
news or the local warnings
okay so that is a shark
now let's talk a little bit more about
the main ideas of this chapter and of
course one of the main ideas
is the food chain let's start on the
right here on the ocean because that's
easier so
like i said we have food chains the
smaller weaker
animals are on the bottom of the food
chain right
on the bottom and at the top of the food
chain
we have the uh the top the animals that
are at the top of the food chain
they are the ones no nothing eats them
right
they eat everything else so a shark
could be at the top
of the food chain and by the way we call
these animals
apex apex means the peak or the
top of something apex predator and
apex predator we already talked about
predator apex predator
is the animal that sits at the top of
the food chain
sharks are at the top of the food chain
in the ocean
of course people eat a lot of sharks and
it's it's actually kind of terrible
what's going on in the world
people are overfishing sharks and sharks
might become extinct
because unfortunately some people
think it's great to eat shark fin soup
so they'll catch the shark cut off the
fin
and throw the rest the shark in the
ocean it's a terrible waste and it's
illegal
so hopefully people will will stop this
practice
but you know usually in in nature
uh sharks are apex predators and they
eat everything
down on the food chain the very bottom
is plankton
plankton here down at the bottom
plankton are very
small creatures that live in the water
and it's
very interesting too because um what
eats plankton well krill will eat the
plankton krill are like little shrimp
uh and they're they're actually very
pretty i scuba dive i used to scuba dive
a lot and they're very amazing
very amazing little creatures on the
coral
krill and then of course what eats the
curl fish and then sharks will eat the
fish
so um this is kind of a good example of
the food chain
but one thing that's very interesting is
plankton you know what else eats
plankton
whales blue whales blue whales are the
biggest creature on earth and what do
they eat
they eat the smallest creature on earth
plankton they have big mouths they just
go through the water
and they just they just take in all the
plankton strain it through their mouths
and that's what they eat you'd think a
whale well it could eat anything
it eats the smallest creature in the
world skips all the other in
animals in between and just goes for the
plankton it's kind of interesting
okay so anyway that's the ocean on land
uh
the food chain is we have plants right
uh plants or leaves a leaf from a plant
or grass that's at the bottom of the
food chain though right those are plants
plants are usually at the bottom of the
food chain what eats the leaf well the
caterpillar will come along and eat the
leaf
and then the bird will come along others
the caterpillar it will eat
the caterpillar and then a cat the cat
sees the bird
if the cat is lucky it will catch the uh
the bird now i wouldn't really call i
mean
this is kind of a funny picture i really
want to call a house cat
an apex predator okay but of course
house cats are domesticated they're pets
you know maybe a mountain lion or a lion
or a cheetah those are apex predators
and there's
the same family the same cat family so
it's interesting so
anyway these are two examples of food
chains one on land
and one in the ocean okay
another idea that we talked about
already quite a bit is
prey and predator now again we have a
food chain here and the food
chain on the bottom of the food chain is
on the left and the top of the food
chain is on the right
so first we have plant a plant and the
type of plant here is a
is corn so corn uses energy from the sun
the plant that grows
corn uses energy from the sun to produce
uh corn and it is not
prey really it's a plant we don't really
call plants prey
prey are usually animals so i wouldn't
call plants prey that's a little bit
weird
but what eats the corn a vole what is a
vole
a vola is a type of mouse or you know in
the same family as a rat but
rats have a bad reputation vols uh mice
have a little bit better reputation
they're more they're cute or furry or
whatever
but voles mice will eat the corn and
like i said farmers don't like these
types of
mouse-like creatures so they do like to
have owls around that will eat
the vole but in this food chain we're
looking at the predator what is the
predator here
the coyote coyotes are very smart
animals
and they will eat a lot of different
things and of course they will eat
the small mice that eats the corn so
they are a predator
the vole is not a predator it does not
eat other animals it eats plants
so but it is hunted by
other animals like owls or coyotes so
they are prey
and the coyote is a predator now the
coyote is also prey to another animal
and that is the mountain lion the
mountain lion is the apex predator
in many western states nothing hunts a
mountain lion
any other animal would be crazy to try
to hunt a mountain lion
because the mountain lions are strong
they're tough they're big
you don't want to mess with a mountain
lion okay so
the mountain lion may hunt and eat a
coyote
of course mountain lions probably don't
hunt coyotes that often
they will hunt other prey animals like
rabbits
or birds or things like that coyotes are
a little bit difficult to catch of
course coyotes
can bite back and they run in packs so
anyway the mountain but the mountain
lion could catch a coyote and eat it so
it's a predator it is an
apex predator okay
let's go over the reading passage
together and as usual i'll read it out
loud you guys repeat after me or
in your mind uh repeat after me and
focus on the pronunciation
and also the words from the vocabulary
section
are you ready let's begin producers
are living things that make their own
food
plants are producers
they make their own food using sunlight
and nutrients
consumers are living things that cannot
make
their own food they eat plants or
animals to live
all animals are consumers consumers
need to find food
a food chain shows what
eats what a caterpillar eats a leaf
a bird eats the caterpillar a cat eats
the bird
this is just one food chain there are
food chains
everywhere a predator
is an animal that hunts and eats
prey prey is the animal
that is hunted and eaten
in the ocean one of the smallest prey
is krill fish eat krill
and sharks eat fish this
is one ocean food chain
the largest animal in the world
is the blue whale it is a predator
blue whales eat krill they
also eat plankton i think it's more
common that they eat plankton but anyway
they might eat krill as well if the
krill is
up off the bottom of the ocean
so blue whales eat krill it's
interesting the largest animal in the
world eats the
smaller smallest animals in the world
so interesting okay
how is the reading passage organized
in this case we have main ideas and
details so we have the main id of the
passage
and we have details that support that
main idea
let's go over it first of all a we have
beep right we have a blank
are living things that cannot make their
own food
so remember all animals are this right
they what do animals do
they consume so they are consumers
consume
[Music]
consumers are also you know consumers
we're talking about
in nature consumers are living things
that cannot make their own food
if we're talking about economics
consumers are people who go out and buy
things right we're all consumers whether
we're
in nature looking for food or whether
we're in the shopping mall looking for
something to buy
right consumers just go out and find
something
to to get and to use for themselves for
their life
okay good next we have another blank
beep are living things that make their
own food so what is the opposite of
consumers
do you remember what we talked about in
the vocabulary section we said
producers producers
so producers are living things that
make their own food if you make
something you produce it so you were a
producer
next we have a predator is an
animal that beep and eats beep
okay so it's interesting here because we
need a verb here because we have a verb
here and it should be
the same form of the verb right so what
do predators do
we talked about this in the vocabulary
section a predator is an animal that
hunts
hunts and we put s s because singular
subject
predator one one predator a predator
hunts and eats what does a predator eat
well predator of course what's the
opposite of a predator
is prey so our main sentence
living things find food in different
ways
three different examples one consumers
they're living things that cannot make
their own food
so they need to hunt and and get their
food their predators
producers are living things that make
their own food and coming back to the
consumers a predator is an animal that
hunts and eats prey
so these are all different examples of
how living things
find food in different ways
okay of course we didn't talk about
human beings
they go to the refrigerator to find food
and then they cook it
whatever they find the refrigerator for
their meal but that's that's not
that's a little bit different okay we're
talking about in nature
okay so interesting lesson how do
animals
in the wild find their food how
do animals typically of course we're
talking about wild animals
in nature as human beings we've changed
nature a little bit to make this process
a lot easier
but we're talking about in the wild how
do animals
find and get food and what are food
chains
now you have a pretty good idea of how
this works
in nature of course in our lives we kind
of separate
ourselves from nature right we just go
to the supermarket and get what we want
uh and then take it home put it in a
refrigerator and then cook it
so it's a little bit different obviously
but it's interesting of course we need
to realize
how it works in nature and how it has
worked for millions and millions of
years
before we changed everything of course
we changed things for the good
i'd rather live in a modern society than
a primitive one
obviously but anyway interesting lesson
i hope you learned a lot of good
words and also some good ideas thanks
for studying with me as
always and we'll see you in the next
lesson take care everybody
bye bye

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading
00:12
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
00:14
we're taking a look at science book four
00:16
lesson four we're talking about the food
00:19
chain
00:20
is anybody hungry okay well in this
00:23
lesson we're going to discover
00:24
what a food chain is and we will also
00:28
talk about the difference between
00:30
prey and predator okay let's get started
00:37
as usual we start with the words the
00:40
vocabulary for this lesson
00:42
and the first word we have is
00:45
producer a producer is a living thing
00:49
that makes its own food so it can create
00:53
or make its own food by itself
00:58
the opposite of a producer is a consumer
01:01
a consumer is a living thing that cannot
01:05
make
01:05
its own food and that of course all
01:08
animals are consumers right
01:10
they will they need to find other things
01:12
to eat
01:15
predator a predator is an animal that
01:18
hunts
01:19
and eats other animal there's a good
01:22
picture right so we see a cheetah and
01:24
looks like a wild hog or wart hog
01:26
it's chasing if it catches it it will
01:29
eat that hog
01:30
so the cheetah of course is a predator
01:34
it will hunt and eat other animals
01:40
pray now again we say opposite right
01:44
uh producer consumer predator the
01:47
opposite of predator
01:48
is prey prey is the animal that is
01:51
hunted
01:52
and eaten by another animal in the
01:54
previous picture we saw a cheetah
01:56
chasing a warthog the cheetah was the
01:59
predator the warthog was the prey
02:01
in this picture we see an owl owls are
02:04
very strong
02:05
predators they're very they're very
02:07
fierce and they're very
02:08
um well like i almost said wise but yeah
02:11
they're smart
02:12
they're very good hunters and what are
02:15
they
02:15
what are they eating it looks like here
02:17
this is another bird
02:19
so they will eat birds but they're also
02:21
very famous for
02:22
uh eating mice and actually
02:26
many people like owls around because the
02:29
owls
02:30
will feed on the mice or the rats
02:32
meaning the mice will
02:33
you know get into places and eat a
02:36
farmer's crops or
02:38
or all the food in the barn or something
02:39
like that and
02:41
so it's good to have owls around to keep
02:43
the population of mice and rats
02:45
under control so owl is a prey
02:48
a prey animal and many different
02:51
i'm sorry an owl is a predator animal
02:55
and the prey is what the owl eats prey
02:57
is an animal that is hunted and
02:59
eaten by another animal in this picture
03:02
the smaller bird
03:03
is the prey so that's nature
03:06
okay next hunt we already saw this word
03:10
with the cheetah we saw this
03:11
the cheetah chasing the warthog right in
03:13
this case we have a cheetah
03:15
who has caught a gazelle or an
03:19
antelope and that's what cheetahs
03:22
and predators do they look for or chase
03:25
an animal
03:27
so as so as in order to
03:30
eat it so that's to hunt
03:33
and many animals hunt people hunt too
03:36
when you have
03:37
especially where i grew up in the west
03:40
american west
03:41
many people in the fall will take their
03:43
rifle go out into the woods and
03:45
hopefully
03:46
they'll shoot a deer or an elk
03:50
they get a permit for this of course
03:51
it's all very legal and you can't go out
03:53
and just shoot a deer
03:55
without a permit from the government but
03:58
they will hunt and uh hunting is kind of
04:00
a way of life especially in nature
04:03
so to hunt of course we hunt for
04:05
different things now too
04:06
right and you know if you're looking for
04:08
a great pair of shoes or
04:10
a nice outfit you might go to the
04:12
shopping mall and hunt
04:14
for your perfect clothes okay so we use
04:16
it for other
04:17
reasons as well food chain
04:21
now we talked about food chain i said
04:23
what is a food chain
04:24
i mentioned that at the beginning of
04:26
this lesson a food
04:28
chain is a line of living things that
04:30
depend on other living things for food
04:32
so we talked about predator and prey
04:36
right prey you know there's many types
04:38
of prey
04:39
and there's many types of predators and
04:41
usually
04:42
the smaller or the weaker animal
04:46
it is that's lower on the food chain
04:49
the stronger and
04:52
faster and bigger the animal
04:55
probably the higher up the food chain
04:59
it is so we have peop we have animals on
05:02
low on the food chain and we have
05:04
animals that are high
05:05
on the food chain now this is an
05:07
interesting picture it's a cartoon of
05:09
course and actually it's kind of a joke
05:11
don't be confused by this picture
05:13
because you can see something very
05:14
strange here and i noticed that on the
05:16
on the cover uh picture i mean it's it's
05:19
a cool picture
05:20
but it's just kind of funny because if
05:22
you notice this right here that is not
05:23
an
05:24
animal that's kind of a joke it's a
05:25
fisherman's joke
05:27
of course the fishermen it's a very
05:29
interesting picture
05:30
this line here of course is a fishing
05:32
line on the hook
05:34
you see a worm so worm of course is very
05:36
small and not very strong it's not
05:38
it's a very weak animal so it's on the
05:40
bottom of the food chain
05:42
and then of course a fish will come and
05:44
eat the eat the worm
05:45
and then a bigger fish will come and eat
05:47
the smaller fish so the bigger fish are
05:49
on the
05:50
higher end of the food chain but what in
05:51
the world is this thing that i circled
05:53
here
05:53
what is that if you look closely it
05:56
looks like an old
05:57
boot and that's like i said it's a
05:59
fisherman's joke a lot
06:00
you know when fishermen go fishing you
06:02
know sometimes the only thing they catch
06:04
are like old tires or uh pieces of
06:07
clothes
06:08
in this case sometimes fishermen like uh
06:10
they they catch something
06:11
oh my gosh i got a big fish and they
06:13
really work hard to pull it in
06:15
and it comes up and it's just an old
06:16
boot okay
06:18
so that's that's kind of a joke or a
06:20
fisherman's tail
06:21
and so the artist uh put this boot in
06:24
here with a mouth
06:25
going to eat the worm and then the fish
06:27
is going to eat the boot
06:28
so of course that's not real that that's
06:30
just a kind of a
06:31
fisherman's joke in the picture and when
06:34
you think about it
06:35
the the the the animal
06:39
that is on the top of this food chain is
06:41
not in the picture
06:43
what do i mean well here's the hook
06:45
right there
06:46
somebody put the worm on that hook right
06:49
so the fish will come and eat that worm
06:51
maybe a bigger fish will come and eat
06:52
that fish but who eats the big fish well
06:55
that's
06:55
the fisherman the fisherman is at the
06:57
top of the food chain
06:59
because they're going to catch they're
07:01
hunting the fish and they're going to
07:02
catch that fish
07:03
and have it for dinner hopefully they
07:05
won't eat the boot
07:06
okay okay that's just a joke okay next
07:10
caterpillar a caterpillar is a small
07:13
insect i'm sure you've probably seen
07:14
them
07:15
out and about in your garden in the
07:18
woods in the
07:19
parks nearby your house and they're
07:22
colorful sometimes they're colorful they
07:23
have little looks like hair sticking up
07:25
out of them
07:27
caterpillars and they just kind of move
07:29
along very slowly and they eat leaves
07:31
they're not very pretty are they they're
07:33
just kind of like a big worm with legs
07:35
but after a while they will turn into a
07:38
butterfly they will
07:39
change into a butterfly they'll make a
07:41
little cocoon
07:42
and after several days that cocoon will
07:45
open up
07:46
and a new it's the same animal but it's
07:48
a completely different
07:50
changed being and it has wings and it
07:53
flies around it's very pretty
07:55
okay shark a shark is a very large fish
07:59
that has
07:59
many teeth and a shark is a predator
08:03
because it has many teeth
08:04
it's very big it's very powerful and
08:07
be careful when you go swim not not
08:09
everywhere i mean you don't really have
08:10
to worry about sharks that often
08:12
uh just in areas that do have sharks be
08:16
uh careful about that know where you're
08:19
going if you're going to go to another
08:21
country or go swimming on the beach
08:23
just know you know if there's a shark
08:25
warning or not most places 99
08:28
uh beaches in the world you don't have
08:30
to worry but some places you do
08:32
so just keep an eye out listen to the
08:34
news or the local warnings
08:36
okay so that is a shark
08:41
now let's talk a little bit more about
08:42
the main ideas of this chapter and of
08:44
course one of the main ideas
08:45
is the food chain let's start on the
08:49
right here on the ocean because that's
08:51
easier so
08:52
like i said we have food chains the
08:54
smaller weaker
08:55
animals are on the bottom of the food
08:58
chain right
08:58
on the bottom and at the top of the food
09:01
chain
09:01
we have the uh the top the animals that
09:05
are at the top of the food chain
09:06
they are the ones no nothing eats them
09:09
right
09:10
they eat everything else so a shark
09:12
could be at the top
09:14
of the food chain and by the way we call
09:17
these animals
09:19
apex apex means the peak or the
09:22
top of something apex predator and
09:25
apex predator we already talked about
09:27
predator apex predator
09:29
is the animal that sits at the top of
09:32
the food chain
09:33
sharks are at the top of the food chain
09:35
in the ocean
09:36
of course people eat a lot of sharks and
09:39
it's it's actually kind of terrible
09:40
what's going on in the world
09:42
people are overfishing sharks and sharks
09:44
might become extinct
09:45
because unfortunately some people
09:49
think it's great to eat shark fin soup
09:51
so they'll catch the shark cut off the
09:52
fin
09:53
and throw the rest the shark in the
09:54
ocean it's a terrible waste and it's
09:56
illegal
09:57
so hopefully people will will stop this
10:01
practice
10:02
but you know usually in in nature
10:05
uh sharks are apex predators and they
10:08
eat everything
10:09
down on the food chain the very bottom
10:10
is plankton
10:12
plankton here down at the bottom
10:14
plankton are very
10:16
small creatures that live in the water
10:18
and it's
10:19
very interesting too because um what
10:22
eats plankton well krill will eat the
10:24
plankton krill are like little shrimp
10:26
uh and they're they're actually very
10:28
pretty i scuba dive i used to scuba dive
10:30
a lot and they're very amazing
10:32
very amazing little creatures on the
10:34
coral
10:35
krill and then of course what eats the
10:37
curl fish and then sharks will eat the
10:39
fish
10:40
so um this is kind of a good example of
10:43
the food chain
10:44
but one thing that's very interesting is
10:45
plankton you know what else eats
10:47
plankton
10:48
whales blue whales blue whales are the
10:52
biggest creature on earth and what do
10:55
they eat
10:56
they eat the smallest creature on earth
10:58
plankton they have big mouths they just
11:00
go through the water
11:01
and they just they just take in all the
11:03
plankton strain it through their mouths
11:05
and that's what they eat you'd think a
11:06
whale well it could eat anything
11:08
it eats the smallest creature in the
11:10
world skips all the other in
11:12
animals in between and just goes for the
11:14
plankton it's kind of interesting
11:16
okay so anyway that's the ocean on land
11:19
uh
11:19
the food chain is we have plants right
11:23
uh plants or leaves a leaf from a plant
11:26
or grass that's at the bottom of the
11:28
food chain though right those are plants
11:30
plants are usually at the bottom of the
11:32
food chain what eats the leaf well the
11:34
caterpillar will come along and eat the
11:36
leaf
11:36
and then the bird will come along others
11:38
the caterpillar it will eat
11:39
the caterpillar and then a cat the cat
11:42
sees the bird
11:43
if the cat is lucky it will catch the uh
11:46
the bird now i wouldn't really call i
11:49
mean
11:49
this is kind of a funny picture i really
11:51
want to call a house cat
11:53
an apex predator okay but of course
11:56
house cats are domesticated they're pets
11:59
you know maybe a mountain lion or a lion
12:01
or a cheetah those are apex predators
12:04
and there's
12:04
the same family the same cat family so
12:07
it's interesting so
12:08
anyway these are two examples of food
12:10
chains one on land
12:12
and one in the ocean okay
12:16
another idea that we talked about
12:17
already quite a bit is
12:19
prey and predator now again we have a
12:22
food chain here and the food
12:24
chain on the bottom of the food chain is
12:26
on the left and the top of the food
12:27
chain is on the right
12:29
so first we have plant a plant and the
12:32
type of plant here is a
12:33
is corn so corn uses energy from the sun
12:37
the plant that grows
12:38
corn uses energy from the sun to produce
12:41
uh corn and it is not
12:45
prey really it's a plant we don't really
12:47
call plants prey
12:49
prey are usually animals so i wouldn't
12:51
call plants prey that's a little bit
12:53
weird
12:54
but what eats the corn a vole what is a
12:57
vole
12:57
a vola is a type of mouse or you know in
13:00
the same family as a rat but
13:02
rats have a bad reputation vols uh mice
13:05
have a little bit better reputation
13:07
they're more they're cute or furry or
13:10
whatever
13:11
but voles mice will eat the corn and
13:14
like i said farmers don't like these
13:15
types of
13:16
mouse-like creatures so they do like to
13:19
have owls around that will eat
13:21
the vole but in this food chain we're
13:23
looking at the predator what is the
13:24
predator here
13:25
the coyote coyotes are very smart
13:28
animals
13:28
and they will eat a lot of different
13:31
things and of course they will eat
13:33
the small mice that eats the corn so
13:35
they are a predator
13:36
the vole is not a predator it does not
13:38
eat other animals it eats plants
13:40
so but it is hunted by
13:43
other animals like owls or coyotes so
13:46
they are prey
13:47
and the coyote is a predator now the
13:50
coyote is also prey to another animal
13:53
and that is the mountain lion the
13:55
mountain lion is the apex predator
13:58
in many western states nothing hunts a
14:01
mountain lion
14:02
any other animal would be crazy to try
14:05
to hunt a mountain lion
14:06
because the mountain lions are strong
14:08
they're tough they're big
14:10
you don't want to mess with a mountain
14:11
lion okay so
14:13
the mountain lion may hunt and eat a
14:15
coyote
14:16
of course mountain lions probably don't
14:19
hunt coyotes that often
14:20
they will hunt other prey animals like
14:23
rabbits
14:24
or birds or things like that coyotes are
14:27
a little bit difficult to catch of
14:29
course coyotes
14:30
can bite back and they run in packs so
14:33
anyway the mountain but the mountain
14:34
lion could catch a coyote and eat it so
14:37
it's a predator it is an
14:38
apex predator okay
14:43
let's go over the reading passage
14:44
together and as usual i'll read it out
14:46
loud you guys repeat after me or
14:49
in your mind uh repeat after me and
14:51
focus on the pronunciation
14:53
and also the words from the vocabulary
14:55
section
14:56
are you ready let's begin producers
15:00
are living things that make their own
15:03
food
15:05
plants are producers
15:08
they make their own food using sunlight
15:12
and nutrients
15:15
consumers are living things that cannot
15:19
make
15:19
their own food they eat plants or
15:22
animals to live
15:24
all animals are consumers consumers
15:28
need to find food
15:32
a food chain shows what
15:35
eats what a caterpillar eats a leaf
15:39
a bird eats the caterpillar a cat eats
15:43
the bird
15:44
this is just one food chain there are
15:47
food chains
15:48
everywhere a predator
15:52
is an animal that hunts and eats
15:56
prey prey is the animal
15:59
that is hunted and eaten
16:03
in the ocean one of the smallest prey
16:07
is krill fish eat krill
16:10
and sharks eat fish this
16:13
is one ocean food chain
16:17
the largest animal in the world
16:20
is the blue whale it is a predator
16:24
blue whales eat krill they
16:27
also eat plankton i think it's more
16:30
common that they eat plankton but anyway
16:32
they might eat krill as well if the
16:34
krill is
16:36
up off the bottom of the ocean
16:39
so blue whales eat krill it's
16:41
interesting the largest animal in the
16:42
world eats the
16:43
smaller smallest animals in the world
16:46
so interesting okay
16:50
how is the reading passage organized
16:53
in this case we have main ideas and
16:56
details so we have the main id of the
16:57
passage
16:58
and we have details that support that
17:00
main idea
17:01
let's go over it first of all a we have
17:03
beep right we have a blank
17:05
are living things that cannot make their
17:07
own food
17:08
so remember all animals are this right
17:11
they what do animals do
17:12
they consume so they are consumers
17:16
consume
17:17
[Music]
17:20
consumers are also you know consumers
17:23
we're talking about
17:24
in nature consumers are living things
17:26
that cannot make their own food
17:28
if we're talking about economics
17:30
consumers are people who go out and buy
17:33
things right we're all consumers whether
17:35
we're
17:36
in nature looking for food or whether
17:38
we're in the shopping mall looking for
17:40
something to buy
17:41
right consumers just go out and find
17:43
something
17:44
to to get and to use for themselves for
17:47
their life
17:48
okay good next we have another blank
17:51
beep are living things that make their
17:54
own food so what is the opposite of
17:56
consumers
17:57
do you remember what we talked about in
17:58
the vocabulary section we said
18:00
producers producers
18:06
so producers are living things that
18:09
make their own food if you make
18:11
something you produce it so you were a
18:14
producer
18:16
next we have a predator is an
18:19
animal that beep and eats beep
18:22
okay so it's interesting here because we
18:25
need a verb here because we have a verb
18:27
here and it should be
18:28
the same form of the verb right so what
18:30
do predators do
18:32
we talked about this in the vocabulary
18:34
section a predator is an animal that
18:36
hunts
18:38
hunts and we put s s because singular
18:41
subject
18:42
predator one one predator a predator
18:45
hunts and eats what does a predator eat
18:48
well predator of course what's the
18:49
opposite of a predator
18:51
is prey so our main sentence
18:55
living things find food in different
18:57
ways
18:58
three different examples one consumers
19:01
they're living things that cannot make
19:02
their own food
19:03
so they need to hunt and and get their
19:06
food their predators
19:08
producers are living things that make
19:09
their own food and coming back to the
19:11
consumers a predator is an animal that
19:13
hunts and eats prey
19:15
so these are all different examples of
19:17
how living things
19:18
find food in different ways
19:21
okay of course we didn't talk about
19:24
human beings
19:24
they go to the refrigerator to find food
19:27
and then they cook it
19:28
whatever they find the refrigerator for
19:30
their meal but that's that's not
19:31
that's a little bit different okay we're
19:33
talking about in nature
19:34
okay so interesting lesson how do
19:37
animals
19:38
in the wild find their food how
19:42
do animals typically of course we're
19:44
talking about wild animals
19:45
in nature as human beings we've changed
19:49
nature a little bit to make this process
19:51
a lot easier
19:52
but we're talking about in the wild how
19:54
do animals
19:56
find and get food and what are food
19:58
chains
19:59
now you have a pretty good idea of how
20:01
this works
20:02
in nature of course in our lives we kind
20:05
of separate
20:06
ourselves from nature right we just go
20:07
to the supermarket and get what we want
20:09
uh and then take it home put it in a
20:11
refrigerator and then cook it
20:12
so it's a little bit different obviously
20:14
but it's interesting of course we need
20:16
to realize
20:17
how it works in nature and how it has
20:20
worked for millions and millions of
20:22
years
20:23
before we changed everything of course
20:25
we changed things for the good
20:27
i'd rather live in a modern society than
20:29
a primitive one
20:30
obviously but anyway interesting lesson
20:33
i hope you learned a lot of good
20:35
words and also some good ideas thanks
20:38
for studying with me as
20:39
always and we'll see you in the next
20:40
lesson take care everybody
20:42
bye bye
20:52
[Music]
21:00
hmm
