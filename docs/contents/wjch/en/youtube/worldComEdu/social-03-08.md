hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
i'm brian stewart and today we're
looking at social studies book three
lesson eight okay got that
okay lesson eight my fingers oh
sometimes it's difficult okay
so in this unit you will discover
where did early american settlers come
from
where did they come from when they came
to america and second
what are some early british colonies
that's what we're going to cover in
today's lesson but first
we're going to go over the vocabulary
our first word is journey
journey is traveling to a place
especially
at a long distance so you might think
well what's the difference between a
journey
and a trip right they're both
similar they took a trip they took a
journey
but a journey usually means a
long trip and it's a difficult trip
and you have many experiences
on the way so of course if you fly
from europe to america it's just a trip
it's not really a journey but if you get
in a boat
and you cross the ocean for many months
that is a journey okay so that's kind of
the difference between
journey and trip explorer
is our next word and explore is a person
who travels to an
area usually the first person to travel
to that area
to learn about it to discover a new land
but you know many explorers when they
have traveled they come to lands there's
people
already living there so it's not like
they discovered it
they discovered it for the people back
home
right the people in their home country
don't know about this
land so they're kind of exploring that
land
for the knowledge of their own native
people back home
okay but of course in many places in the
world
explorers would go to a new a new area
but there were people already living
there okay so they didn't really
discover the land
but they did explore it for their home
country okay moving on
adventure have you been on an adventure
an adventure is something that is
exciting usually
interesting hopefully it's fun not
always fun but
hopefully it's fun adventure has a
positive meaning
so an adventure remember the word
journey we talked about that before a
journey is a long
trip maybe a difficult trip well an
adventure is a journey
or event with unknown danger
but usually we think of adventure in a
fun
or exciting way like you take an
adventure
to a camp or you take an adventure to
the beach
and some interesting things happen to
you but of course
when we read books about adventures of
people a long time ago
they they faced many dangers but it was
exciting and they survived
so it's an adventure or like an
adventure story
okay like peter pan would be an
adventure story
okay next colonist
now a colonist is a
person how do we know that because ist
whenever you have ist you know that it's
a type of person
it is a person who lives in a newly
settled town and really a call a
colonist comes from the
word call luni
and colonies are when
one country or one nation sends
its own citizens to a foreign land
and they make a town there okay it's
that new land is not really part of the
nation or the country
where the people are coming from but
they're establishing
like they're they're claiming that land
as their own
and they're sending their people to live
there and that is a colony of course
we don't practice that anymore thank
goodness
okay um because most of the areas are
settled and people have
rights to their own land so we don't
have colonies anymore but a long time
ago
hundreds of years ago many countries
would wanted to spread out and claim
land
around the world and they would send out
colonists
to populate their colonies okay
a settlement is a type of colony
right a settlement is a small town in a
new
area new area for the home country right
so the home
country would uh you know they go out
they explore they find new lands
and they create a small town they would
call that town
a settlement okay next word
survive to survive means to stay alive
or to go on living
now of course it's very easy to survive
these days
we have many conveniences but hundreds
of years ago
people had difficult time
had a difficult time surviving in places
that were new to them right if they go
to a new place and there
aren't any towns or cities
or things that they are familiar with
and they have to live in nature
well then it's very difficult to survive
so it's survive is you know to try to
endure
difficult conditions and to continue
living
copper copper is a type of metal there
are many types of metal
that are important to people for example
copper is probably the
the most common rare uh most common
valuable
metal most common valuable well that's
probably tin
but copper is is maybe next to that
and then silver gold platinum right
so copper is relatively common
but you need to mine it and it's a metal
that we can use for many different
things now a long time ago
copper was a metal that well it still is
but copper was used to make things like
pots and uh pottery
it's still used copper is still used
sometimes to make cooking pans
but usually copper nowadays is used to
make electrical wiring
right it's all runs through all the
wires to make light
and to give electricity into your home
so it's it's kind of red brown and it's
relatively soft if you take a knife
and try to
push it into copper you will leave a
mark so it's a little bit of a soft
metal but it was very useful because it
is a metal many metals of course are
very useful
to human beings okay next
lumber lumber is another type of
resource metal
is a resource lumber is a resource but
lumber comes from
trees right if you cut down a tree
and you cut the tree into very long
parts you have a very long piece of wood
it's the standard size is two by four
two inches by four
inches sorry i don't know the
centimeters but two by four
these are two by fours and it just means
two inches
wide four inches long and that is a
standard size
for lumber that is used to build houses
right
a wood that is cut up to be used and
usually we make houses
out of lumber okay those are our words
for this lesson
let's move on to the main ideas one main
idea
is the settlers roots to a new land
and like i said before one of the things
we're going to learn
in this unit is where did american
settlers come from
well this map shows that many early
american settlers came from england
right
england is over here right europe is
this land mass here
well i cut off italy sorry about that
but italy of course is part of europe
and so is greece okay
don't want to cut those countries out so
the
most people in the early
days of american settlement were talking
about
you know 60 1500 more 1600s
most of the settlements settlers that
came over from
england uh to america of course they
were from england
later on a lot of germans came over and
later on of course a lot of amer
europe other european countries came
over but the very earliest settlements
were from england now i and they took a
root
now this word here is interesting root
we pronounce it two different ways
americans will pronounce it two
different ways
some americans will say root like
the roots of plants it rhymes with hoot
right but sometimes americans will say
route
and uh i could spell it like that or
just i'll i'll do this
route so o-w it rhymes with
shout okay so
both pronunciations are okay don't get
confused about that
some people will say root what route did
you take
some people will say route what which
route
did you take both are very common
both are okay they're very acceptable in
american some americans say root
some americans say route sometimes it
depends on where they're from in america
but both are perfectly acceptable
pronunciations
but be careful about spelling right it's
spelled r-o-u-t
route but many people pronounce it root
okay anyway they came on over uh this is
the route that they took they went
through the atlantic ocean
it's a very took a very long journey
these are the ships
that they came over in imagine being in
a ship like that it's a small ship
it's made of wood and
sailing for months across the atlantic
ocean you can't see any land
this is kind of primitive right it's all
made of wood and the ship
moves like this for months
it makes some people sick to their
stomach this is a very
difficult trip that's why it's called a
journey
it would be very difficult to cross the
atlantic ocean
in a ship like that and then they would
come to america
and they would make settlements small
towns in some two of the
earliest settlements by english settlers
in america were of course plymouth and
jamestown so people from england built
colonies called settlements and that's a
little bit of history for you
this is usually in the 1600s sixteen
hundreds whoops my s okay there we go
okay good next what are some english
colonies first of all we have jamestown
colony
jamestown was the first successful
settlement
in north america successful right
because some other colonies were not
successful
there's a famous story about a uh a
colony called
roanoke and the settlers went there and
they settled the town that called it
roanoke
and they settled there for a few years
and then you know people some people
went back to england and they came back
with supplies to come back to settlement
everybody was gone where did they go
nobody knows even to this day they have
no idea what happened to those people
so these settlements and establishing a
colony was a very
it's kind of dangerous back then right
it was very difficult for these people
to come to a new land
they weren't familiar with the animals
they weren't familiar with the plants
it was difficult for them to survive in
what they considered
wilderness in nature so unfortunately
many people died and
in some cases a whole settlement
disappeared
okay so anyway jamestown was the first
successful colony
in north america for britain and
plymouth
colony was another famous colony
in american history the settlers who
came to plymouth county
and that was in massachusetts uh which
is now a state in north america it's
it's on the northern part of the east
coast above new york
plymouth county the settlers who went
there were families of
english pilgrims pilgrims are people who
go on a journey for a religious purpose
and they sailed to north america for
religious freedom
now of course a lot of politics things
were happening in england
and some groups some religious groups in
england
did not agree with the king with the and
the king's religion
so they had to run away and many of them
went to america
to make their own colony and they said
they wanted to practice religious
freedom
but the problem was if you didn't agree
with them
then you really had a hard time living
in plymouth so
interesting but anyway that was the idea
they sailed to north america for
religious freedom
okay let's move on
let's begin the reading section and
as usual i'll read it out loud go ahead
and read along with me to practice
pronunciation
and we'll take note of the key
vocabulary
in the reading passage okay are you
ready let's begin
the early americans made a long and
dangerous
journey across the atlantic ocean
to america they were explorers
discovering a new land and trading with
the native americans
for copper and other materials
the life of the early americans was a
real
adventure they had to cut lumber
to make their homes and build
their own furniture furniture of course
is like beds wardrobes
chairs tables all the things inside your
house
that you use and you can move around
those things are called
furniture it's singular don't say
furnitures
right we say furniture okay
every colonist came to america to find a
better life
they lived in settlements called
jamestown
and plymouth growing their own food
and working together to survive
with the help of the native american
tribes
the first settlers were able to get the
things they needed
and learn about the new land
the lives of the first settlers in
america were very
hard at first but by working together
and helping each other they made a happy
new life okay and like i said before
these settlers they came to
a new land but it wasn't new for the
native
american tribes there were many people
already living in america and they were
different groups we called those groups
tribes native american tribes and we
talked about them
in a previous lesson okay good
how is this reading organized let's take
a look at the reading skill
so here we have the main idea and
details
what is the main idea of this passage
well
as we saw the life of the early
americans was a real
what remember when you have an
experience it's usually a new experience
it can have many dangers in it but we
usually think of it as a positive word
it's something new
something that's not ordinary and it's
filled with
interesting experiences some of them
dangerous some of them can be fun
too so we call that an adventure
so the life of the early americans was a
real
adventure
a real adventure okay
they who is they well they of course
supports the main idea of the early
americans
the early americans that's they they
they beep they beep with native
americans for copper
and other materials materials here you
we can also say
re oops sorry are re
sore says resources
and natural resources natural resources
are the materials you get from nature
that you use for something like i said
people use copper to make pots
cooking pans things like that and other
materials
to make homes and furniture these are
resources now how did they get them
right the native americans had a lot of
them
the colonists they had other things they
had things like
guns the native americans liked beads or
jewelry
and so they would trade so they traded
with the native americans
that's when you exchange one good for
another good i have something you want
you have something
i want so we trade okay so we traded
and they traded with the native
americans okay good and trade of course
was very important
for both economies of the native
americans and for the english as well
next they had to cut beep to make their
homes
what did i talk about before and i said
i made a point of saying what the
dimensions two by four
what were we talking about in that
section well of course we were talking
about
lumber right you cut down a tree and you
make lumber out of it
and that's how they build their homes
they built their homes
they had to cut lumber to make their
homes
they didn't just make their homes out of
wood they also made what
chairs desks well i don't know if they
made desks but tables
uh beds dressers
desks why not they had to study okay so
that what what do we call all those
things we call those things
furniture and before i said singular
it's really non-count
it's a non-count noun so don't say
furnitures it's
furniture it's kind of like a collective
noun furniture
for
sure so then build their own furniture
can you build your own furniture that's
kind of cool if you can
if you can learn how to use wood or or
yeah use wood to
to make a chair or to make a table
that'd be something cool huh
okay maybe in school okay next
they lived in beep called jamestown and
plymouth so what did we call jamestown
and plymouth
yes they were colonies but what's
another word for colonies that we talked
about in this lesson we used the word
settlements
so they lived in settlements
settlements
called jamestown and cal and and
plymouth called jamestown and plymouth
of course you could also say they lived
in colonies it's it's basically the same
idea
whoops colonies plural s
okay so they lived in settlements or
they lived in colonies called jamestown
in plymouth
okay so that's a little bit of history
for you a little bit of history about
the
early american uh history and of course
wasn't really called they weren't called
americans at that time
they were british subjects so they were
english
okay america came much later
okay so a little bit of history for you
okay i hope you learned a lot especially
about
some important vocabulary not just
history but of course we're focusing on
vocabulary
and english usage so thank you very much
for studying with me
and we'll see you in the next one take
care everybody bye bye
you

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading
00:12
i'm brian stewart and today we're
00:13
looking at social studies book three
00:16
lesson eight okay got that
00:20
okay lesson eight my fingers oh
00:22
sometimes it's difficult okay
00:24
so in this unit you will discover
00:28
where did early american settlers come
00:30
from
00:31
where did they come from when they came
00:32
to america and second
00:35
what are some early british colonies
00:38
that's what we're going to cover in
00:40
today's lesson but first
00:41
we're going to go over the vocabulary
00:45
our first word is journey
00:48
journey is traveling to a place
00:51
especially
00:52
at a long distance so you might think
00:55
well what's the difference between a
00:57
journey
00:58
and a trip right they're both
01:01
similar they took a trip they took a
01:04
journey
01:05
but a journey usually means a
01:09
long trip and it's a difficult trip
01:12
and you have many experiences
01:15
on the way so of course if you fly
01:19
from europe to america it's just a trip
01:22
it's not really a journey but if you get
01:24
in a boat
01:25
and you cross the ocean for many months
01:29
that is a journey okay so that's kind of
01:31
the difference between
01:33
journey and trip explorer
01:36
is our next word and explore is a person
01:40
who travels to an
01:41
area usually the first person to travel
01:45
to that area
01:46
to learn about it to discover a new land
01:49
but you know many explorers when they
01:52
have traveled they come to lands there's
01:53
people
01:54
already living there so it's not like
01:56
they discovered it
01:57
they discovered it for the people back
02:00
home
02:00
right the people in their home country
02:03
don't know about this
02:04
land so they're kind of exploring that
02:07
land
02:07
for the knowledge of their own native
02:10
people back home
02:12
okay but of course in many places in the
02:14
world
02:15
explorers would go to a new a new area
02:18
but there were people already living
02:20
there okay so they didn't really
02:22
discover the land
02:23
but they did explore it for their home
02:27
country okay moving on
02:30
adventure have you been on an adventure
02:34
an adventure is something that is
02:36
exciting usually
02:37
interesting hopefully it's fun not
02:40
always fun but
02:41
hopefully it's fun adventure has a
02:43
positive meaning
02:45
so an adventure remember the word
02:47
journey we talked about that before a
02:49
journey is a long
02:50
trip maybe a difficult trip well an
02:53
adventure is a journey
02:54
or event with unknown danger
02:58
but usually we think of adventure in a
03:00
fun
03:01
or exciting way like you take an
03:04
adventure
03:05
to a camp or you take an adventure to
03:08
the beach
03:08
and some interesting things happen to
03:10
you but of course
03:12
when we read books about adventures of
03:14
people a long time ago
03:16
they they faced many dangers but it was
03:18
exciting and they survived
03:20
so it's an adventure or like an
03:22
adventure story
03:23
okay like peter pan would be an
03:25
adventure story
03:26
okay next colonist
03:30
now a colonist is a
03:33
person how do we know that because ist
03:36
whenever you have ist you know that it's
03:38
a type of person
03:40
it is a person who lives in a newly
03:44
settled town and really a call a
03:47
colonist comes from the
03:49
word call luni
03:52
and colonies are when
03:55
one country or one nation sends
03:58
its own citizens to a foreign land
04:02
and they make a town there okay it's
04:05
that new land is not really part of the
04:07
nation or the country
04:09
where the people are coming from but
04:11
they're establishing
04:13
like they're they're claiming that land
04:15
as their own
04:16
and they're sending their people to live
04:18
there and that is a colony of course
04:20
we don't practice that anymore thank
04:23
goodness
04:24
okay um because most of the areas are
04:26
settled and people have
04:28
rights to their own land so we don't
04:30
have colonies anymore but a long time
04:32
ago
04:32
hundreds of years ago many countries
04:34
would wanted to spread out and claim
04:36
land
04:37
around the world and they would send out
04:39
colonists
04:41
to populate their colonies okay
04:46
a settlement is a type of colony
04:49
right a settlement is a small town in a
04:52
new
04:52
area new area for the home country right
04:55
so the home
04:56
country would uh you know they go out
04:58
they explore they find new lands
05:00
and they create a small town they would
05:02
call that town
05:03
a settlement okay next word
05:07
survive to survive means to stay alive
05:10
or to go on living
05:12
now of course it's very easy to survive
05:14
these days
05:15
we have many conveniences but hundreds
05:18
of years ago
05:19
people had difficult time
05:22
had a difficult time surviving in places
05:26
that were new to them right if they go
05:27
to a new place and there
05:29
aren't any towns or cities
05:32
or things that they are familiar with
05:35
and they have to live in nature
05:37
well then it's very difficult to survive
05:40
so it's survive is you know to try to
05:43
endure
05:44
difficult conditions and to continue
05:47
living
05:50
copper copper is a type of metal there
05:53
are many types of metal
05:54
that are important to people for example
05:57
copper is probably the
05:58
the most common rare uh most common
06:01
valuable
06:02
metal most common valuable well that's
06:04
probably tin
06:05
but copper is is maybe next to that
06:08
and then silver gold platinum right
06:12
so copper is relatively common
06:15
but you need to mine it and it's a metal
06:18
that we can use for many different
06:20
things now a long time ago
06:22
copper was a metal that well it still is
06:24
but copper was used to make things like
06:26
pots and uh pottery
06:30
it's still used copper is still used
06:32
sometimes to make cooking pans
06:34
but usually copper nowadays is used to
06:36
make electrical wiring
06:38
right it's all runs through all the
06:39
wires to make light
06:41
and to give electricity into your home
06:44
so it's it's kind of red brown and it's
06:46
relatively soft if you take a knife
06:49
and try to
06:52
push it into copper you will leave a
06:54
mark so it's a little bit of a soft
06:56
metal but it was very useful because it
06:59
is a metal many metals of course are
07:00
very useful
07:01
to human beings okay next
07:05
lumber lumber is another type of
07:07
resource metal
07:08
is a resource lumber is a resource but
07:10
lumber comes from
07:12
trees right if you cut down a tree
07:15
and you cut the tree into very long
07:19
parts you have a very long piece of wood
07:22
it's the standard size is two by four
07:25
two inches by four
07:28
inches sorry i don't know the
07:30
centimeters but two by four
07:32
these are two by fours and it just means
07:34
two inches
07:35
wide four inches long and that is a
07:39
standard size
07:40
for lumber that is used to build houses
07:43
right
07:44
a wood that is cut up to be used and
07:46
usually we make houses
07:47
out of lumber okay those are our words
07:51
for this lesson
07:53
let's move on to the main ideas one main
07:56
idea
07:57
is the settlers roots to a new land
08:01
and like i said before one of the things
08:03
we're going to learn
08:05
in this unit is where did american
08:07
settlers come from
08:09
well this map shows that many early
08:12
american settlers came from england
08:15
right
08:15
england is over here right europe is
08:18
this land mass here
08:19
well i cut off italy sorry about that
08:22
but italy of course is part of europe
08:24
and so is greece okay
08:26
don't want to cut those countries out so
08:29
the
08:30
most people in the early
08:33
days of american settlement were talking
08:36
about
08:36
you know 60 1500 more 1600s
08:41
most of the settlements settlers that
08:44
came over from
08:44
england uh to america of course they
08:48
were from england
08:49
later on a lot of germans came over and
08:51
later on of course a lot of amer
08:53
europe other european countries came
08:55
over but the very earliest settlements
08:57
were from england now i and they took a
09:00
root
09:01
now this word here is interesting root
09:04
we pronounce it two different ways
09:06
americans will pronounce it two
09:07
different ways
09:08
some americans will say root like
09:12
the roots of plants it rhymes with hoot
09:17
right but sometimes americans will say
09:21
route
09:23
and uh i could spell it like that or
09:25
just i'll i'll do this
09:26
route so o-w it rhymes with
09:30
shout okay so
09:33
both pronunciations are okay don't get
09:35
confused about that
09:37
some people will say root what route did
09:40
you take
09:41
some people will say route what which
09:43
route
09:44
did you take both are very common
09:47
both are okay they're very acceptable in
09:49
american some americans say root
09:51
some americans say route sometimes it
09:53
depends on where they're from in america
09:56
but both are perfectly acceptable
09:58
pronunciations
10:00
but be careful about spelling right it's
10:02
spelled r-o-u-t
10:04
route but many people pronounce it root
10:08
okay anyway they came on over uh this is
10:11
the route that they took they went
10:12
through the atlantic ocean
10:14
it's a very took a very long journey
10:16
these are the ships
10:18
that they came over in imagine being in
10:21
a ship like that it's a small ship
10:22
it's made of wood and
10:26
sailing for months across the atlantic
10:28
ocean you can't see any land
10:31
this is kind of primitive right it's all
10:33
made of wood and the ship
10:34
moves like this for months
10:38
it makes some people sick to their
10:40
stomach this is a very
10:41
difficult trip that's why it's called a
10:44
journey
10:44
it would be very difficult to cross the
10:47
atlantic ocean
10:48
in a ship like that and then they would
10:51
come to america
10:52
and they would make settlements small
10:54
towns in some two of the
10:56
earliest settlements by english settlers
10:59
in america were of course plymouth and
11:03
jamestown so people from england built
11:06
colonies called settlements and that's a
11:09
little bit of history for you
11:11
this is usually in the 1600s sixteen
11:15
hundreds whoops my s okay there we go
11:19
okay good next what are some english
11:22
colonies first of all we have jamestown
11:25
colony
11:26
jamestown was the first successful
11:29
settlement
11:30
in north america successful right
11:33
because some other colonies were not
11:36
successful
11:36
there's a famous story about a uh a
11:39
colony called
11:41
roanoke and the settlers went there and
11:45
they settled the town that called it
11:46
roanoke
11:47
and they settled there for a few years
11:50
and then you know people some people
11:52
went back to england and they came back
11:53
with supplies to come back to settlement
11:55
everybody was gone where did they go
11:58
nobody knows even to this day they have
12:01
no idea what happened to those people
12:04
so these settlements and establishing a
12:06
colony was a very
12:07
it's kind of dangerous back then right
12:09
it was very difficult for these people
12:11
to come to a new land
12:12
they weren't familiar with the animals
12:14
they weren't familiar with the plants
12:17
it was difficult for them to survive in
12:19
what they considered
12:20
wilderness in nature so unfortunately
12:24
many people died and
12:25
in some cases a whole settlement
12:27
disappeared
12:29
okay so anyway jamestown was the first
12:31
successful colony
12:32
in north america for britain and
12:35
plymouth
12:36
colony was another famous colony
12:39
in american history the settlers who
12:41
came to plymouth county
12:43
and that was in massachusetts uh which
12:46
is now a state in north america it's
12:48
it's on the northern part of the east
12:50
coast above new york
12:52
plymouth county the settlers who went
12:54
there were families of
12:55
english pilgrims pilgrims are people who
12:58
go on a journey for a religious purpose
13:02
and they sailed to north america for
13:04
religious freedom
13:06
now of course a lot of politics things
13:08
were happening in england
13:10
and some groups some religious groups in
13:13
england
13:13
did not agree with the king with the and
13:16
the king's religion
13:18
so they had to run away and many of them
13:20
went to america
13:21
to make their own colony and they said
13:23
they wanted to practice religious
13:25
freedom
13:26
but the problem was if you didn't agree
13:29
with them
13:29
then you really had a hard time living
13:32
in plymouth so
13:33
interesting but anyway that was the idea
13:35
they sailed to north america for
13:37
religious freedom
13:38
okay let's move on
13:42
let's begin the reading section and
13:45
as usual i'll read it out loud go ahead
13:48
and read along with me to practice
13:50
pronunciation
13:51
and we'll take note of the key
13:54
vocabulary
13:55
in the reading passage okay are you
13:57
ready let's begin
14:01
the early americans made a long and
14:04
dangerous
14:04
journey across the atlantic ocean
14:08
to america they were explorers
14:12
discovering a new land and trading with
14:15
the native americans
14:17
for copper and other materials
14:23
the life of the early americans was a
14:26
real
14:27
adventure they had to cut lumber
14:30
to make their homes and build
14:33
their own furniture furniture of course
14:38
is like beds wardrobes
14:41
chairs tables all the things inside your
14:44
house
14:45
that you use and you can move around
14:47
those things are called
14:48
furniture it's singular don't say
14:52
furnitures
14:53
right we say furniture okay
14:58
every colonist came to america to find a
15:01
better life
15:03
they lived in settlements called
15:05
jamestown
15:06
and plymouth growing their own food
15:10
and working together to survive
15:16
with the help of the native american
15:19
tribes
15:20
the first settlers were able to get the
15:23
things they needed
15:24
and learn about the new land
15:28
the lives of the first settlers in
15:30
america were very
15:32
hard at first but by working together
15:35
and helping each other they made a happy
15:39
new life okay and like i said before
15:42
these settlers they came to
15:44
a new land but it wasn't new for the
15:47
native
15:47
american tribes there were many people
15:51
already living in america and they were
15:53
different groups we called those groups
15:55
tribes native american tribes and we
15:58
talked about them
15:59
in a previous lesson okay good
16:03
how is this reading organized let's take
16:06
a look at the reading skill
16:08
so here we have the main idea and
16:10
details
16:11
what is the main idea of this passage
16:14
well
16:14
as we saw the life of the early
16:16
americans was a real
16:18
what remember when you have an
16:20
experience it's usually a new experience
16:23
it can have many dangers in it but we
16:25
usually think of it as a positive word
16:27
it's something new
16:28
something that's not ordinary and it's
16:31
filled with
16:32
interesting experiences some of them
16:34
dangerous some of them can be fun
16:36
too so we call that an adventure
16:39
so the life of the early americans was a
16:42
real
16:44
adventure
16:46
a real adventure okay
16:50
they who is they well they of course
16:54
supports the main idea of the early
16:56
americans
16:57
the early americans that's they they
17:00
they beep they beep with native
17:03
americans for copper
17:05
and other materials materials here you
17:08
we can also say
17:09
re oops sorry are re
17:12
sore says resources
17:17
and natural resources natural resources
17:19
are the materials you get from nature
17:21
that you use for something like i said
17:24
people use copper to make pots
17:26
cooking pans things like that and other
17:29
materials
17:30
to make homes and furniture these are
17:33
resources now how did they get them
17:35
right the native americans had a lot of
17:37
them
17:37
the colonists they had other things they
17:40
had things like
17:41
guns the native americans liked beads or
17:44
jewelry
17:44
and so they would trade so they traded
17:47
with the native americans
17:49
that's when you exchange one good for
17:52
another good i have something you want
17:55
you have something
17:56
i want so we trade okay so we traded
18:00
and they traded with the native
18:02
americans okay good and trade of course
18:04
was very important
18:05
for both economies of the native
18:07
americans and for the english as well
18:10
next they had to cut beep to make their
18:13
homes
18:14
what did i talk about before and i said
18:16
i made a point of saying what the
18:18
dimensions two by four
18:19
what were we talking about in that
18:21
section well of course we were talking
18:23
about
18:24
lumber right you cut down a tree and you
18:26
make lumber out of it
18:28
and that's how they build their homes
18:30
they built their homes
18:32
they had to cut lumber to make their
18:34
homes
18:35
they didn't just make their homes out of
18:37
wood they also made what
18:40
chairs desks well i don't know if they
18:43
made desks but tables
18:45
uh beds dressers
18:48
desks why not they had to study okay so
18:51
that what what do we call all those
18:53
things we call those things
18:54
furniture and before i said singular
18:56
it's really non-count
18:58
it's a non-count noun so don't say
19:00
furnitures it's
19:01
furniture it's kind of like a collective
19:03
noun furniture
19:05
for
19:08
sure so then build their own furniture
19:12
can you build your own furniture that's
19:14
kind of cool if you can
19:16
if you can learn how to use wood or or
19:18
yeah use wood to
19:20
to make a chair or to make a table
19:22
that'd be something cool huh
19:24
okay maybe in school okay next
19:27
they lived in beep called jamestown and
19:30
plymouth so what did we call jamestown
19:32
and plymouth
19:33
yes they were colonies but what's
19:35
another word for colonies that we talked
19:37
about in this lesson we used the word
19:40
settlements
19:42
so they lived in settlements
19:46
settlements
19:49
called jamestown and cal and and
19:51
plymouth called jamestown and plymouth
19:53
of course you could also say they lived
19:55
in colonies it's it's basically the same
19:58
idea
19:59
whoops colonies plural s
20:02
okay so they lived in settlements or
20:04
they lived in colonies called jamestown
20:06
in plymouth
20:07
okay so that's a little bit of history
20:10
for you a little bit of history about
20:11
the
20:12
early american uh history and of course
20:15
wasn't really called they weren't called
20:17
americans at that time
20:18
they were british subjects so they were
20:20
english
20:21
okay america came much later
20:24
okay so a little bit of history for you
20:26
okay i hope you learned a lot especially
20:28
about
20:29
some important vocabulary not just
20:32
history but of course we're focusing on
20:33
vocabulary
20:34
and english usage so thank you very much
