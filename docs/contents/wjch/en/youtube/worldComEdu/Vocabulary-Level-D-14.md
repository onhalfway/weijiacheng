hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary
i'm your host brian stewart we're going
over cycles still we're still talking
about cycles
as you remember cycles are things that
don't really start anywhere
or finish anywhere they just kind of go
and they repeat
again and again but what we're talking
about
in lesson 14 is what a farmer knows
and we're focusing on smart farming
methods so farmers think about
cycles when they work they have to know
about cycles
in order to grow the correct
food for us of course we need to eat and
farmers
uh need to grow the food that we get at
the supermarket right
so what do farmers know about cycles how
do they use their knowledge
to help them in their jobs that's what
we'll read about
in this lesson but again before we read
before we do the reading section
we need to go over a vocabulary a
vocabulary list
to make sure we understand the reading
section well
let's go so the first one number one
of course we can see a farmer here with
some of his products
right now when we talk about the
farmer's products we say the crop
that is gathered at the end of a season
the crop crop of course means the type
of food that the farmer's growing
when they gather at the end of a season
we
call it the harvest
right so this is a noun and we say
that it is all of the food that the
farmer grows at the end of the season
now we can talk about the harvest for
one farmer
but usually we talk about the harvest
and we mean all farmers for a region
or a nation so if we say the harvest was
very good this year
we're usually talking about all farmers
in
our region the harvest was very good
this year
so there's a lot of food in the
supermarkets maybe prices are low
but of course we could also talk about
individual one individual farmer has a
bad harvest
and another farmer has a good harvest so
bad harvest
good harvest it's the amount of food
that they collect
at the end of the growing season okay
next one
number two to put seeds in a field to
grow
well what do farmers do they put the
seeds into
the ground in the field to grow they
don't do it by hand
so much these days they usually use
machines but what do they call that they
call it to
sow to sow and it's interesting
there's a an expression i think it comes
from the bible
you reap
what you
sow you reap what you sow reap means to
harvest to gather at the end you get it
but think about it whatever you put in
the ground
that's what you're gonna get but not
just planting
uh seeds in the ground if you lie
you're going to get a lot of problems so
if you sow problems if you lie if you do
bad
actions what will you get from those
you'll get bad results
you reap what you sow but if you do good
actions
and you tell the truth and you're good
to your friends then
you will get a lot of appreciation and
good things back from your friends
so that's a good expression to remember
and it uses the word so
it comes from to put fields to put seeds
in the field to grow
but also in our life we're also sowing
our life right we're our actions are
sowing uh the results that we'll get
later on so you reap what you sow
so is an irregular verb we say so sowed
sown sowed sod so
sod sown so we don't normally use this
word in our everyday speech because
we're not farmers
but sometimes we see expressions that do
use this word
okay next one to reach full growth
to reach full growth is to mature
and we need of course when we're talking
about plants and crops like
corn tomatoes apples pears
we don't pick these things when they're
young
when they're not mature we have to wait
till they are fully grown
then we pick them and eat them if you
pick the tomato
before it's mature it's too small and
it's green and
oh it tastes horrible right but if you
wait till it's mature
and then you eat it then it tastes good
and it's larger
okay a plant grown by
farmers so any plant grown by farmers
we already use this word in the fir in
explaining the first word
it's crop so any plant grown by farmers
is a crop usually crops are things we
eat for example potatoes
tomatoes celery looks like
they have here squash those are crops
but it's not just food because sometimes
farmers will grow things that we don't
eat
but that are used in other purp
for other purposes okay for example like
barley that's used to make
beer right well some people will make
food from barley too
but farmers don't just grow food they
grow many different types
of plants that are not just used for
fruit food but
any plant that is grown by farmers is we
call it a crop
okay next one a substance that keeps
living beings healthy and a lot of
things we can see
the different listing it's a list of
what
nutrients right and we have this word
here
nutrition facts they're very similar
nutrition
has to do with the uh things that we
have to eat every day
to keep us healthy and those individual
things are
nutrients you should choose foods
that have good nutrients and a lot of
nutrients
in them usually junk food like
hamburgers and french fries
don't have a lot of nutrients right
healthy food has many nutrients these
are substances
that keep us healthy next one
to prepare the land for growing crops
farming is hard work right uh this
especially using this
in a garden in somebody's garden you
have to what do you have to do to the
soil
you have to cultivate you have to
prepare
the land for growing crops now in a big
farm
they have big machines that will
turn up the land that will cultivate the
field
and then it's ready so that they can put
the seeds down they can sow the land
then but this is what we call cultivate
cultivate isn't just for farming we can
also use it for
other ideas for example when you study
you are cultivating your mind you're
preparing
your mind for later on in life
right when you study different subjects
so you can cultivate your mind
parents can cultivate their children it
just means that you're preparing them
for something else when you cultivate
the land for growing crops
you are cultivating okay next one
good for growing having plenty of
nutrients
so if the land is good for growing you
can grow a lot of
good uh crops there and the land has a
lot of nutrients
in the soil we say that the land is
fertile fertile and if the land
is not fertile we say it's in fertile
in means not so if you think of the
desert
can you grow plants in the desert no you
can't because
the desert is infertile there's not
enough nutrients in the soil
of course there's not enough water okay
but if you see
good rich earth and you pick it up and
it's black
or it's very dark brown or black earth
that's fertile soil it's good it has a
lot of nutrients in it
it's good for growing crops it's fertile
okay next one eight to use again and of
course we know this symbol here we see
this
in many places these days but of course
this is what you should do with your
garbage if you're finished with a
plastic bottle
what should you do you should use it
again you should
re-cycle re means
again right and cycle we know that work
right it goes
in a cycle so we recycle we use it again
and again
and this is what we should do with our
garbage right plastic here
paper here metal here other garbage
in another place recycle your garbage
then
we can use it again
number nine and animal waste animal
waste
we think about animal waste in a
previous lesson we talked about this
right about
training your dog remember you may
remember what do pets do
dogs go poo and pee poo
and pee of course the poo is
right okay and p
of course is the water this is animal
waste
now it's interesting because farmers use
animal waste they use it to feed
plants did you know that right if your
dog goes poo poo
next to a tree that's good for the tree
because the tree uses that as the there
are nutrients
in the poop of course it's very
disgusting we shouldn't
you know you know don't touch it don't
get near it but
plants like it right because that's
their food
okay so animal waste and remember we are
animals too
so it can be human waste not just your
dog
animal waste that is used to feed plants
we have a special word for it we don't
call it poo or pee
or dung we call it manure
manure and it's usually like
cow manure or horse manure it could be
other types of animals but usually it's
cow manure because farmers have cows a
lot of cows
and what are they doing they're pooing a
lot so they use that
for manure and in fact that's an
industry some companies
make manure that's their job they take
the animal waste and they make it
into manure that looks like this and
they sell it to farmers
and so they transfer it so that's an
industry that's a company right it's
very interesting business
okay next one 10. having a bad
smell before i said poo is nem se na
payo right
we say stinky you can also say stinky
oh your feet are stinky oh and i'm
saying
right you say your feet are stinky
or somebody's breath it's stinky or
somebody's
you know underarm stinky okay
stinky next one 11 to take away
not shoes but to take away means to to
drain
so imagine this poor guy here his energy
is drained it's like a battery right
your cell phone battery
the battery is gone you take away the
battery power by using
your cell phone you drain the battery
some people's people it's like they have
a battery their body they lose all their
energy
they feel drained i feel drained
that's some some people can say that it
means i have no energy it's all gone
next one acting in a smart and sensible
way
so if someone acts in a smart and
sensible what is this girl doing
she's she's pushing away the hamburger
and the coke and instead of eating the
hamburger
she's eating an apple this is sensible
so she is wise wise
is like smart but wise also means you
have a lot of
experience you're acting on experience
smart smart kind of means
you're intelligent you maybe you know
about how to solve math problems or
you know how to do that but wise is more
like life experience
if you know how to act in a sensible or
practical way
because of your life experience you are
wise
and that's usually why older people are
wise
because they have more experience in
life there's a little difference between
wise and smart
right wise is usually because of past
experiences you act in a sensible way
okay next one a big open space
filled with plants so of course this is
famous is this gordian
is it right you have the tea
the the the plants that they make tea
from
green tea korea is famous for tea and
there's a place in
in korea that is very famous for growing
tea it looks like this is a picture from
that area
or an area similar to that but it
doesn't matter if it's tea
it could be corn it could be wheat it's
a big open space filled with plants
we call it a field okay farmers need
usually it's usually flat of course if
it's on a hill or a mountain it's not a
field really it should be flat
and farmers need wide open fields
to grow their crops field
okay 14 absolutely necessary
so what is it it's a seat belt
absolutely necessary it's
crucial now a seat belt some people may
argue well seat belt's not
absolutely necessary right a lot of
times i don't get in an
accident but nowadays because of safety
and because of the traffic laws
we think seat belts are absolutely
necessary they're
crucial they're very important because
if you do get in an accident
they are absolutely necessary to make
sure that you are not
injured or killed so they are crucial
crucial something that's needed very
much
next one okay i was talking about poop
before right
clean up after your dog means scoop up
the poop
right uh now this definition though
unused food that the body gets rid of
right unused food when you eat something
your body uses most of the food but some
of the food that it doesn't use and that
food passes through your body what do we
call it
we call it waste okay
now before you may have encountered ways
to sometimes people refer to
garbage as waste and that's possible
right especially for like a big
factories or big businesses
have a lot of waste it's like extra
stuff that they don't need
we call that waste but it we also call
the organic the food the edible
material that passes through our body
and we get rid of when we go to the
bathroom
we call that waste okay
okay next word last word is facts and
ideas
that are known facts and ideas that we
know
those are knowledge so think about that
human beings are getting more
and more facts and more and more ideas
every year every 10 years every 100
years
the amount of knowledge of that human
beings have gathered together especially
over the past
several hundred years has grown by a lot
so we talk about that knowledge as we
talk about those ideas and those facts
as
knowledge so facts and ideas that we
know about
that's knowledge there's many things we
don't know about
but human beings are very curious we
keep learning about our environment
and so our our area or
our degree of knowledge keeps growing
okay well those are the words let's do
the exercises
see how well we remember those words
okay number one
we need to beep the field before we
spread the seeds
so before you spread the seeds and put
them in the ground
what do you need to do you need to
prepare the field
is that pull cultivate sow or
cover remember so is spread the seeds
so we need to do something before we sow
the field
we need to cultivate the field
remember cultivate means to prepare
to prepare something we need to prepare
the field before we spread the seeds we
need to cultivate
the field before we spread the seeds
okay number three
we've cultivated there's that word again
we've cultivated that field
with plenty of manure it is very
beep okay so again part of cultivating
part of preparing the land
is you know like turning you know making
a rose in it or
or breaking up the top surface so the
seeds can get in the land easily
but another part of cultivating is
putting manure
on the ground right so when you put
manure on the ground remember manure has
a lot of nutrients
in it that's good for the plants and
when we say a plant an area
is good or has a lot of nutrients it's
good for growing
we say that land is fertile fertile
we've cultivated that field with plenty
of manure it is very
fertile or fertile some people pronounce
it different ways
fertile so not useless not marked
not understood but fertile okay next one
five you should beep that bottle you can
fill it back up with water
fill it back up so you have a bottle
right a plastic bottle of water okay
i'm not going to throw it away i'm going
to use it again i'm going to fill it
back up with water because why should i
throw it away right still good
right so what should i do i should use
it again
what word means to use again a recycle b
harvest c believe or d crack
of course you know a means to use again
you should recycle that bottle
you should use it again because you can
fill it up with water again
don't throw it away use it again seven
that plant is not healthy not healthy
it needs more what what do plants need
to grow well what did i
talk about before what do plants need to
keep their bodies strong and healthy not
just plants but also
animals nutrients crops
fields or knowledge okay now we're
talking about healthy right
not smart besides plants can't think
they don't have brains
so right away we know knowledge is not
the answer
crops no because that's a type of food
that farmers grow
fields it needs more fields that doesn't
make sense
it needs of course more nutrients
nutrients are what living things need
to stay healthy so that's the answer
okay well that wraps it up for the
vocabulary section let's take a short
break and we'll come back and look at
the reading
together

hello everybody welcome back to reading
00:10
for vocabulary
00:12
i'm your host brian stewart we're going
00:14
over cycles still we're still talking
00:16
about cycles
00:17
as you remember cycles are things that
00:19
don't really start anywhere
00:21
or finish anywhere they just kind of go
00:23
and they repeat
00:24
again and again but what we're talking
00:27
about
00:27
in lesson 14 is what a farmer knows
00:31
and we're focusing on smart farming
00:34
methods so farmers think about
00:38
cycles when they work they have to know
00:41
about cycles
00:42
in order to grow the correct
00:45
food for us of course we need to eat and
00:48
farmers
00:49
uh need to grow the food that we get at
00:52
the supermarket right
00:53
so what do farmers know about cycles how
00:56
do they use their knowledge
00:58
to help them in their jobs that's what
01:00
we'll read about
01:01
in this lesson but again before we read
01:04
before we do the reading section
01:06
we need to go over a vocabulary a
01:08
vocabulary list
01:09
to make sure we understand the reading
01:11
section well
01:13
let's go so the first one number one
01:16
of course we can see a farmer here with
01:18
some of his products
01:20
right now when we talk about the
01:22
farmer's products we say the crop
01:24
that is gathered at the end of a season
01:27
the crop crop of course means the type
01:30
of food that the farmer's growing
01:32
when they gather at the end of a season
01:35
we
01:36
call it the harvest
01:39
right so this is a noun and we say
01:43
that it is all of the food that the
01:45
farmer grows at the end of the season
01:48
now we can talk about the harvest for
01:50
one farmer
01:51
but usually we talk about the harvest
01:53
and we mean all farmers for a region
01:56
or a nation so if we say the harvest was
01:59
very good this year
02:00
we're usually talking about all farmers
02:03
in
02:04
our region the harvest was very good
02:06
this year
02:07
so there's a lot of food in the
02:08
supermarkets maybe prices are low
02:12
but of course we could also talk about
02:13
individual one individual farmer has a
02:15
bad harvest
02:16
and another farmer has a good harvest so
02:19
bad harvest
02:20
good harvest it's the amount of food
02:23
that they collect
02:24
at the end of the growing season okay
02:27
next one
02:28
number two to put seeds in a field to
02:31
grow
02:32
well what do farmers do they put the
02:34
seeds into
02:35
the ground in the field to grow they
02:38
don't do it by hand
02:40
so much these days they usually use
02:42
machines but what do they call that they
02:44
call it to
02:45
sow to sow and it's interesting
02:49
there's a an expression i think it comes
02:51
from the bible
02:52
you reap
02:56
what you
03:00
sow you reap what you sow reap means to
03:04
harvest to gather at the end you get it
03:06
but think about it whatever you put in
03:09
the ground
03:09
that's what you're gonna get but not
03:11
just planting
03:13
uh seeds in the ground if you lie
03:16
you're going to get a lot of problems so
03:20
if you sow problems if you lie if you do
03:24
bad
03:24
actions what will you get from those
03:26
you'll get bad results
03:28
you reap what you sow but if you do good
03:31
actions
03:32
and you tell the truth and you're good
03:33
to your friends then
03:35
you will get a lot of appreciation and
03:38
good things back from your friends
03:40
so that's a good expression to remember
03:41
and it uses the word so
03:44
it comes from to put fields to put seeds
03:46
in the field to grow
03:47
but also in our life we're also sowing
03:50
our life right we're our actions are
03:52
sowing uh the results that we'll get
03:55
later on so you reap what you sow
03:57
so is an irregular verb we say so sowed
04:00
sown sowed sod so
04:04
sod sown so we don't normally use this
04:06
word in our everyday speech because
04:08
we're not farmers
04:10
but sometimes we see expressions that do
04:12
use this word
04:14
okay next one to reach full growth
04:17
to reach full growth is to mature
04:21
and we need of course when we're talking
04:23
about plants and crops like
04:25
corn tomatoes apples pears
04:28
we don't pick these things when they're
04:31
young
04:31
when they're not mature we have to wait
04:34
till they are fully grown
04:36
then we pick them and eat them if you
04:39
pick the tomato
04:40
before it's mature it's too small and
04:43
it's green and
04:44
oh it tastes horrible right but if you
04:46
wait till it's mature
04:48
and then you eat it then it tastes good
04:50
and it's larger
04:51
okay a plant grown by
04:55
farmers so any plant grown by farmers
04:58
we already use this word in the fir in
05:01
explaining the first word
05:02
it's crop so any plant grown by farmers
05:06
is a crop usually crops are things we
05:09
eat for example potatoes
05:11
tomatoes celery looks like
05:15
they have here squash those are crops
05:18
but it's not just food because sometimes
05:21
farmers will grow things that we don't
05:23
eat
05:23
but that are used in other purp
05:26
for other purposes okay for example like
05:30
barley that's used to make
05:32
beer right well some people will make
05:34
food from barley too
05:35
but farmers don't just grow food they
05:37
grow many different types
05:39
of plants that are not just used for
05:41
fruit food but
05:42
any plant that is grown by farmers is we
05:45
call it a crop
05:46
okay next one a substance that keeps
05:50
living beings healthy and a lot of
05:53
things we can see
05:54
the different listing it's a list of
05:56
what
05:57
nutrients right and we have this word
06:00
here
06:00
nutrition facts they're very similar
06:03
nutrition
06:04
has to do with the uh things that we
06:07
have to eat every day
06:08
to keep us healthy and those individual
06:11
things are
06:12
nutrients you should choose foods
06:15
that have good nutrients and a lot of
06:18
nutrients
06:19
in them usually junk food like
06:21
hamburgers and french fries
06:24
don't have a lot of nutrients right
06:27
healthy food has many nutrients these
06:29
are substances
06:31
that keep us healthy next one
06:35
to prepare the land for growing crops
06:38
farming is hard work right uh this
06:41
especially using this
06:42
in a garden in somebody's garden you
06:44
have to what do you have to do to the
06:46
soil
06:47
you have to cultivate you have to
06:49
prepare
06:50
the land for growing crops now in a big
06:54
farm
06:54
they have big machines that will
06:57
turn up the land that will cultivate the
07:00
field
07:01
and then it's ready so that they can put
07:02
the seeds down they can sow the land
07:05
then but this is what we call cultivate
07:08
cultivate isn't just for farming we can
07:11
also use it for
07:12
other ideas for example when you study
07:15
you are cultivating your mind you're
07:18
preparing
07:19
your mind for later on in life
07:22
right when you study different subjects
07:24
so you can cultivate your mind
07:26
parents can cultivate their children it
07:29
just means that you're preparing them
07:31
for something else when you cultivate
07:32
the land for growing crops
07:34
you are cultivating okay next one
07:38
good for growing having plenty of
07:40
nutrients
07:42
so if the land is good for growing you
07:44
can grow a lot of
07:45
good uh crops there and the land has a
07:49
lot of nutrients
07:50
in the soil we say that the land is
07:53
fertile fertile and if the land
07:57
is not fertile we say it's in fertile
08:01
in means not so if you think of the
08:04
desert
08:04
can you grow plants in the desert no you
08:07
can't because
08:08
the desert is infertile there's not
08:11
enough nutrients in the soil
08:12
of course there's not enough water okay
08:15
but if you see
08:16
good rich earth and you pick it up and
08:18
it's black
08:19
or it's very dark brown or black earth
08:23
that's fertile soil it's good it has a
08:25
lot of nutrients in it
08:27
it's good for growing crops it's fertile
08:30
okay next one eight to use again and of
08:34
course we know this symbol here we see
08:36
this
08:36
in many places these days but of course
08:38
this is what you should do with your
08:40
garbage if you're finished with a
08:41
plastic bottle
08:43
what should you do you should use it
08:44
again you should
08:46
re-cycle re means
08:49
again right and cycle we know that work
08:52
right it goes
08:53
in a cycle so we recycle we use it again
08:56
and again
08:57
and this is what we should do with our
08:59
garbage right plastic here
09:00
paper here metal here other garbage
09:04
in another place recycle your garbage
09:06
then
09:07
we can use it again
09:10
number nine and animal waste animal
09:13
waste
09:14
we think about animal waste in a
09:16
previous lesson we talked about this
09:17
right about
09:18
training your dog remember you may
09:20
remember what do pets do
09:22
dogs go poo and pee poo
09:25
and pee of course the poo is
09:30
right okay and p
09:33
of course is the water this is animal
09:35
waste
09:36
now it's interesting because farmers use
09:39
animal waste they use it to feed
09:43
plants did you know that right if your
09:46
dog goes poo poo
09:48
next to a tree that's good for the tree
09:51
because the tree uses that as the there
09:54
are nutrients
09:55
in the poop of course it's very
09:57
disgusting we shouldn't
09:58
you know you know don't touch it don't
10:00
get near it but
10:01
plants like it right because that's
10:04
their food
10:05
okay so animal waste and remember we are
10:08
animals too
10:09
so it can be human waste not just your
10:10
dog
10:12
animal waste that is used to feed plants
10:14
we have a special word for it we don't
10:15
call it poo or pee
10:17
or dung we call it manure
10:20
manure and it's usually like
10:23
cow manure or horse manure it could be
10:26
other types of animals but usually it's
10:28
cow manure because farmers have cows a
10:30
lot of cows
10:31
and what are they doing they're pooing a
10:33
lot so they use that
10:35
for manure and in fact that's an
10:37
industry some companies
10:39
make manure that's their job they take
10:42
the animal waste and they make it
10:44
into manure that looks like this and
10:47
they sell it to farmers
10:48
and so they transfer it so that's an
10:50
industry that's a company right it's
10:52
very interesting business
10:54
okay next one 10. having a bad
10:57
smell before i said poo is nem se na
11:00
payo right
11:01
we say stinky you can also say stinky
11:04
oh your feet are stinky oh and i'm
11:06
saying
11:07
right you say your feet are stinky
11:10
or somebody's breath it's stinky or
11:13
somebody's
11:14
you know underarm stinky okay
11:17
stinky next one 11 to take away
11:21
not shoes but to take away means to to
11:24
drain
11:25
so imagine this poor guy here his energy
11:28
is drained it's like a battery right
11:31
your cell phone battery
11:33
the battery is gone you take away the
11:36
battery power by using
11:38
your cell phone you drain the battery
11:41
some people's people it's like they have
11:44
a battery their body they lose all their
11:45
energy
11:46
they feel drained i feel drained
11:49
that's some some people can say that it
11:52
means i have no energy it's all gone
11:55
next one acting in a smart and sensible
11:58
way
11:59
so if someone acts in a smart and
12:00
sensible what is this girl doing
12:02
she's she's pushing away the hamburger
12:05
and the coke and instead of eating the
12:07
hamburger
12:08
she's eating an apple this is sensible
12:11
so she is wise wise
12:15
is like smart but wise also means you
12:18
have a lot of
12:19
experience you're acting on experience
12:21
smart smart kind of means
12:23
you're intelligent you maybe you know
12:24
about how to solve math problems or
12:27
you know how to do that but wise is more
12:29
like life experience
12:31
if you know how to act in a sensible or
12:34
practical way
12:35
because of your life experience you are
12:38
wise
12:39
and that's usually why older people are
12:42
wise
12:42
because they have more experience in
12:45
life there's a little difference between
12:46
wise and smart
12:48
right wise is usually because of past
12:51
experiences you act in a sensible way
12:55
okay next one a big open space
12:59
filled with plants so of course this is
13:01
famous is this gordian
13:02
is it right you have the tea
13:05
the the the plants that they make tea
13:08
from
13:08
green tea korea is famous for tea and
13:11
there's a place in
13:12
in korea that is very famous for growing
13:14
tea it looks like this is a picture from
13:16
that area
13:17
or an area similar to that but it
13:19
doesn't matter if it's tea
13:20
it could be corn it could be wheat it's
13:22
a big open space filled with plants
13:24
we call it a field okay farmers need
13:29
usually it's usually flat of course if
13:31
it's on a hill or a mountain it's not a
13:33
field really it should be flat
13:35
and farmers need wide open fields
13:38
to grow their crops field
13:41
okay 14 absolutely necessary
13:44
so what is it it's a seat belt
13:46
absolutely necessary it's
13:48
crucial now a seat belt some people may
13:51
argue well seat belt's not
13:53
absolutely necessary right a lot of
13:55
times i don't get in an
13:56
accident but nowadays because of safety
13:59
and because of the traffic laws
14:01
we think seat belts are absolutely
14:03
necessary they're
14:04
crucial they're very important because
14:07
if you do get in an accident
14:09
they are absolutely necessary to make
14:11
sure that you are not
14:12
injured or killed so they are crucial
14:15
crucial something that's needed very
14:18
much
14:19
next one okay i was talking about poop
14:21
before right
14:22
clean up after your dog means scoop up
14:26
the poop
14:26
right uh now this definition though
14:29
unused food that the body gets rid of
14:32
right unused food when you eat something
14:36
your body uses most of the food but some
14:38
of the food that it doesn't use and that
14:40
food passes through your body what do we
14:42
call it
14:43
we call it waste okay
14:46
now before you may have encountered ways
14:48
to sometimes people refer to
14:51
garbage as waste and that's possible
14:53
right especially for like a big
14:55
factories or big businesses
14:57
have a lot of waste it's like extra
15:00
stuff that they don't need
15:01
we call that waste but it we also call
15:04
the organic the food the edible
15:08
material that passes through our body
15:09
and we get rid of when we go to the
15:11
bathroom
15:12
we call that waste okay
15:15
okay next word last word is facts and
15:18
ideas
15:19
that are known facts and ideas that we
15:21
know
15:22
those are knowledge so think about that
15:27
human beings are getting more
15:30
and more facts and more and more ideas
15:33
every year every 10 years every 100
15:35
years
15:36
the amount of knowledge of that human
15:40
beings have gathered together especially
15:43
over the past
15:43
several hundred years has grown by a lot
15:47
so we talk about that knowledge as we
15:50
talk about those ideas and those facts
15:52
as
15:52
knowledge so facts and ideas that we
15:55
know about
15:56
that's knowledge there's many things we
15:58
don't know about
15:59
but human beings are very curious we
16:01
keep learning about our environment
16:03
and so our our area or
16:06
our degree of knowledge keeps growing
16:09
okay well those are the words let's do
16:12
the exercises
16:13
see how well we remember those words
16:16
okay number one
16:17
we need to beep the field before we
16:19
spread the seeds
16:21
so before you spread the seeds and put
16:23
them in the ground
16:24
what do you need to do you need to
16:25
prepare the field
16:27
is that pull cultivate sow or
16:30
cover remember so is spread the seeds
16:34
so we need to do something before we sow
16:37
the field
16:38
we need to cultivate the field
16:41
remember cultivate means to prepare
16:45
to prepare something we need to prepare
16:47
the field before we spread the seeds we
16:49
need to cultivate
16:50
the field before we spread the seeds
16:53
okay number three
16:54
we've cultivated there's that word again
16:57
we've cultivated that field
16:58
with plenty of manure it is very
17:02
beep okay so again part of cultivating
17:06
part of preparing the land
17:07
is you know like turning you know making
17:09
a rose in it or
17:11
or breaking up the top surface so the
17:13
seeds can get in the land easily
17:15
but another part of cultivating is
17:18
putting manure
17:19
on the ground right so when you put
17:21
manure on the ground remember manure has
17:23
a lot of nutrients
17:25
in it that's good for the plants and
17:27
when we say a plant an area
17:29
is good or has a lot of nutrients it's
17:31
good for growing
17:32
we say that land is fertile fertile
17:36
we've cultivated that field with plenty
17:38
of manure it is very
17:40
fertile or fertile some people pronounce
17:42
it different ways
17:43
fertile so not useless not marked
17:47
not understood but fertile okay next one
17:50
five you should beep that bottle you can
17:54
fill it back up with water
17:55
fill it back up so you have a bottle
17:59
right a plastic bottle of water okay
18:02
i'm not going to throw it away i'm going
18:04
to use it again i'm going to fill it
18:06
back up with water because why should i
18:08
throw it away right still good
18:09
right so what should i do i should use
18:12
it again
18:13
what word means to use again a recycle b
18:16
harvest c believe or d crack
18:19
of course you know a means to use again
18:22
you should recycle that bottle
18:24
you should use it again because you can
18:26
fill it up with water again
18:28
don't throw it away use it again seven
18:31
that plant is not healthy not healthy
18:35
it needs more what what do plants need
18:37
to grow well what did i
18:38
talk about before what do plants need to
18:42
keep their bodies strong and healthy not
18:43
just plants but also
18:45
animals nutrients crops
18:48
fields or knowledge okay now we're
18:51
talking about healthy right
18:53
not smart besides plants can't think
18:55
they don't have brains
18:56
so right away we know knowledge is not
18:58
the answer
18:59
crops no because that's a type of food
19:02
that farmers grow
19:04
fields it needs more fields that doesn't
19:06
make sense
19:07
it needs of course more nutrients
19:10
nutrients are what living things need
19:12
to stay healthy so that's the answer
19:15
okay well that wraps it up for the
19:17
vocabulary section let's take a short
19:19
break and we'll come back and look at
19:20
the reading
19:22
together
19:40
[Music]
19:41
you
