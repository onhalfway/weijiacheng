kid on the top
just sitting on the tree but the child
on the bottom
what's going on cling the child is
clinging to the tree to hold on to to
stick to something to cling to something

and throwing so when you grab somebody

what
type of fighting are they doing there's
lots of different fighting right
there's martial arts like taekwondo

smart but be careful intelligent is
really
ability ability

i hope so
right because studying can be hard but
if you're intelligent
you can study quickly and learn things
quickly
next one having lots of hair so if
something has a lot of hair
we say it's furry now we may have
learned this word before
fur fur is just a lot of hair on a
on a body of you know an animal
animals have fur so they have a lot of
fur
if they have a lot of fur then you can
say you can make it an
adjective this is an adjective right
adjective

make it an adjective it becomes furry
so my dog is very furry a bear
is very furry okay furry
i'm not furry i hope not no i just have
maybe hair in my my arms but i'm not
furry people aren't furry
animals are furry okay oh
what's going on here this is a big subah
no it's not watermelon it's somebody's
stomach right
lower stomach what else do we call it
pickle by the way just had to say that
okay
we say it's belly and i said pecop right
pecop is right here right looks like a
little i is looking at the boy
but pecop in english we say belly
button so we use that word belly
belly belly is kind of a casual
word uh you know kids use it belly uh
stomach is more of a formal word doctors
will use
stomach parents will use stomach but you
know if you're speaking casually with
your friends
and belly so you know belly like a big
belly like me
right okay okay so belly and this of
course everybody has a belly button you
have a belly button that's what we call
it there
belly when we use it in the plural we
change
y to i and es at the end
belize right so if many people
you're talking about many people they
have many bellies
okay belly okay
a small stick if we're looking at a
small stick a very small
stick maybe this long maybe this long
it's very thin
we can say that it is a twig a twig
is another word for a small stick
english is very descriptive
isn't it we have a lot of specific words
for very uh unique or very special types
of things
stick is like an umbrella word you know
you have long sticks
short sticks you know thick sticks thin
sticks but a
twig is a special kind of stick it means
short and thin it's a twig you can hold
it easily
what is this guy doing is he crazy okay
what is he yelling at his golf club
a feeling he has strong emotions
maybe he's very upset because he hit the
ball and it went the wrong way
so instead of thinking oh i made a
mistake he blames
his golf club he's very has a very
strong emotion
towards his golf club but remember
emotions aren't just
negative emotions can be positive too
happiness is an emotion if you're really
really happy
that's an emotion if you're really
really sad that's also an emotion
there are many kinds of emotions
emotions can be
positive and they can be
negative so
emotion isn't a positive or negative
word it just means
all of those emotions it's like an
umbrella word for that
okay oh look at this chimp he's dancing
right
it's a cool chimp okay an animal that
looks like a monkey
i just said the word it's a chimpanzee
now
notice that at the beginning of the
lesson it said
smart as a chimp because chimpanzee
which is the whole name is a lot of
times
people will shorten it and just say
chimp right i went to see a chimp
at the zoo chimps are very
smart so we can say chimpanzee
chimpanzee or we can just say
chimp it means the same thing it's an
animal that looks like a monkey actually
it is a monkey
it's a type of monkey okay
ten thinking much or thinking a lot
about what you are doing when you're
thinking a lot about what you're doing
you are being very careful right you're
being very careful
this person's being very careful looking
at the bugs right
when you think a lot about what you're
doing you do it carefully
you should think a lot about the things
you are doing
do things carefully some things you
don't have to think
a lot about like you know you know
well brushing your teeth you have to do
it carefully think about how you brush
your teeth
but sometimes we don't do things very
carefully we don't think about them
because it's habit or we do them many
times
but if we do something and we think
about it very
deeply then we're doing it carefully
okay
11. oh that's a sad situation
pain in the stomach
what do we call that you say i have
such a long word it gives me a headache
to think about it
okay stomach ache and notice i just said
headache now there's a lot of aches that
you can have
there are a lot of eggs you can have a
headache
right you can have a stomach ache
you can have a backache so we use ache
for with different parts of the body
right
to say that they hurt not always right
don't say i have a nose ache that
doesn't work
right it's usually headache backache you
could have a toothache
toothache toothache
it's one word i'm just showing the
difference and stomachache right
those are commonly the words we use with
ache
don't say have an elbow ache or an arm
ache and that's weird
you could say i have an ache in my arm
i have an ache in my elbow or you could
probably just say
my ain't hurts
it hurts my arm hurts my
elbow hurts my tooth hurts do not
say my tooth is sick
that's crazy right let's say if you're
walking along
ow your thumb you bang your thumb
against the table
oh up by all right don't say oh my thumb
is sick
huh your thumb is sick at you oh
poor thumb go to bed and drink some
orange juice that's crazy
right you can't say that you only
use sick with your whole body i am sick
susan is sick if you're sick it means
you
have a disease you have a cold you
should go to bed
drink hot liquids take some medicine
that's not what this is going on you
don't say my
stomach is sick oh poor stomach go to
bed
no you say i have a stomach ache
or my stomach hurts don't say my stomach
is sick that's isaan hail
only people can be sick now notice
we say stomach ache before we learned
belly so you can also say
bellyache right i have a bellyache or my
belly hurts
right pain in the stomach pain in the
belly belly ache
or most people will say stomachache
okay so one word a lot of interesting
things about that word it's a good
word a useful word remember to say these
or say my momo hurts my mobo what's a
momo
oh my whatever right my arm hurts
my ear hurts my head hurts my leg hurts
my thumb hurts okay so interesting word
okay next one
oh that's very cute isn't it these
sisters
maybe they're sisters they love each
other right so what are they doing
they hold closely with the arms when you
hold something closely with your arms
because you love it
like your brother your sister or your
puppy dog right
what are you doing you are hugging it
to hug you hug something you hold
closely with your arms you show somebody
that you love them you hug them okay
next one whoa i know him he's a famous
director okay anyway
to make a sound that shows you are
pleased
now looks like these guys are talking
and what is he doing he's going
right he's pleased he is laughing i have
kind of a
strange laugh huh i'm sorry but you know
some people have a very deep left
some people have a little that right
so there's many kinds of laughs but we
call them a laugh we call that action
to laugh to make a sound that shows you
are pleased
or you are happy or something is funny
then you laugh okay next one
cleaning it's time to clean to press
your hand
on something and move back and forth
press your hand on the glass and move
back and forth
what are you doing you are rubbing
now rub doesn't always mean somebody's
cleaning right if somebody's arm
hurts you can rub it maybe it will feel
better but be careful
why does it hurt if there's a nail
sticking in their arm don't rub it
right but if they've been exercising
then you can rub it
right so rub just means to put your hand
or your fingers on a surface and move
back and forth
right with pressure to rub something
okay of course when you clean things you
have to rub
them well okay
oh are you hungry we have something here
to eat

a nut by the way it's interesting in
english
be careful using nut right nut is a food
but you can
also call people a nut if you say
he's a nut
it means he's kind of crazy right
uh he's kind of crazy he's a nut or
you're a nut
sometimes people will joke around and
you call your friend
oh you're so you're so silly you're a
nut
right that's sometimes people will call
other people a nut
but that's just you know you know a
different meaning
this of course is food it's a nut nuts
are good for you
okay next one oh these are not good for
you but they taste

13:30
so there's many kinds of laughs but we

14:04
cleaning right if somebody's arm
14:07
hurts you can rub it maybe it will feel
14:11
better but be careful
14:12
why does it hurt if there's a nail
14:14
sticking in their arm don't rub it
14:16
right but if they've been exercising
14:19
then you can rub it
14:20
right so rub just means to put your hand
14:23
or your fingers on a surface and move
14:26
back and forth

15:18
also call people a nut if you say
15:22

15:26
it means he's kind of crazy right
15:29
