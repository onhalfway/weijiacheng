hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading i'm brian stewart
and in this lesson we're taking a look
at science book 3
lesson 10. wow lesson 10 already we're
moving fast
so in this lesson you will discover how
earth's orbit makes seasons
and also how shadows change
during the day so interesting lesson
ahead
as always let's start with the
vocabulary our first
word is axis axis
is an interesting word an axis is a line
around which something turns now here we
have an interesting picture it looks a
little
complicated right but it's an important
picture
and it's important idea to think about
because when we think about the earth
right we have
the north and the south on the north is
on the top
and south is on the bottom but it's not
exactly
top and bottom it's a little bit like
this
and that line is not a straight line up
and down
it's kind of a diagonal line and that
is the axis now the earth turns
around that axis the earth doesn't turn
around a line that's straight up and
down
the earth turns around a line that is
tilted
a little bit and we'll look at tilt in a
little bit but it's it's not straight up
and down
it's on its side just a little bit and
the earth
turns like this so axis a line around
which something
turns okay so if you have a top if you
have a spinning toy right you spin it
the axis is straight up and down but
after that
toy loses energy it begins
to do this and the access
moves it's not straight up and down
anymore it moves from side to side
that is the axis okay good next
tilt what i just talked about right
the line uh if you spin that toy
right and it's it's spinning at the
beginning there's no tilt
it's straight up and down but like i
said as it loses energy
it begins to move like this and it tilts
from side to side
now the earth doesn't do that very
quickly right the earth isn't losing
energy
as fast as their your top thank goodness
okay
so but the earth doesn't spin straight
up and down it
is at a tilt tilt means to cause
something to be in a sloping
position sloping position we can also
say
diagonal diagonal
right this would be a straight line up
and down
this is a diagonal line so if something
moves around on an axis that's at um and
it's not a straight up and down line
it's it's tilting a little bit okay and
the earth does this that's a very
important thing to know
and to remember okay tilt
orbit now another thing that's going on
independent
of the rotation of the earth is that the
earth is moving
around the sun for a long time people
thought the sun
moved around the earth but no it doesn't
happen that way the sun
stays put well the sun moves everything
is moving
but in our solar system if you just look
at the solar system the sun
is stationary it doesn't move and the
planets
orbit around the sun so orbit is to move
around something
in a continuous curving
path it might not be a perfect circle in
fact
some planets have they're not in a
perfect circle they're a little bit
um long or are short in some parts
depending on which part of the circle
you're looking at
we call that an oval right but if
something moves around
something right we call that an orbit
and the earth is orbiting the sun
the moon is orbiting the earth right and
all the other planets jupiter saturn
neptune uh mercury venus mars
all of them are orbiting the sun okay so
to orbit
to move around something in a continuous
curving
path rotate so
the earth is doing really two main
motions right the earth is
moving in an orbit but at the same time
it's also turning on its axis so there
are two
important motions to think about here
right the earth is moving this way
but as it moves it's also spinning
right that's interesting okay so that
and that spinning motion
we say it is rotating so to turn
with a circular movement and why is that
important let's talk about that
because if the earth didn't rotate we
wouldn't have
sunrises right so the earth is moving
like this
as it goes around the sun and because
it's rotating very fast
relative to the speed at which it goes
around the sun
the part different parts of the earth
are
shown to the sun at different times
and it takes 24 hours to fully rotate
to spin around once and because of that
our day is 24 hours long right and the
start of the day is sunrise when the
earth turns and you live in this part of
the earth
the earth turns the sun seems to rise
the sun doesn't rise right as i said the
sun doesn't move
but we are on earth we don't know we're
moving right because we're that's the
you know we were born this way
we're just used to the motion we don't
think of it as we're moving
right right now you're probably sitting
at your desk
watching this on your computer screen or
maybe on your cell phone
but you feel i'm not moving yes you are
we're all moving very quickly
we're moving like this we're also moving
like this okay
so it looks like the sun is coming up
over the edge of the land it's not
really coming up it's just because the
earth is turning
that we call it sunrise so the sun seems
to
rise in the morning the time in the
morning when you first see the sun
we call that sunrise and we have a video
of that
and as you can see it's morning you
can't tell is it morning or is it
evening well if you just wait a little
bit right you can see oh there's the sun
it's coming up we see it gradually
coming up over the mountains now it's
not very quick
i mean it it seems kind of quick sure
but
thankfully the day isn't you know really
fast okay
and we have a lot of hours to enjoy the
sunlight and
and to do the things we need to do
during the day but the sun
seems to come up over the mountains oh
we can also call this
the horizon horizon
so the horizon is the edge of our site
right and in this case it's very easy
it's the mountains but if it's flat
right the if there are no mountains the
horizon would be down here
right okay good
what is the opposite of sunrise of
course that is sunset the sun
seems to fall down and disappear
over the horizon this is the horizon
here right the edge of the land
or the sea in this case the edge of the
water
sunset is the time in the evening when
you last see
the sun bye bye son we'll see you in the
morning
okay so when you last see the sun that
is
the sunset okay those are the words for
vocabulary today okay let's take a look
at
a main idea of this passage and we're
talking about
the earth's motion around the sun and
how it causes the different
seasons here we have the different
seasons we have spring
we have summer we have fall and we have
winter
have you ever wondered why there are
different seasons
well the seasons are caused by the
earth's rotation remember there are two
main
there are two main uh they're not caused
by the earth's rotation by the earth's
movement and there are two main
movements of the earth around the sun so
first earth always rotates
in the same direction right it always
goes around
in this uh circular motion right
it doesn't suddenly stop and go back
that would be crazy right
besides how would it do that where would
it get the energy to do that
right when the solar system was formed
it was all spinning
in a certain direction right and that's
why all the planets
and the sun rotates too everything is
rotating
and orbiting in the same direction uh
and that's kind of interesting okay so
earth's rotation
causes the seasons to change why is that
remember there's two things going on the
earth is tilted right
and it's moving around the sun so it's
tilted like this
well sometimes that tilt means that the
northern hemisphere the northern part
of the earth is sometimes pointed
towards the sun right but as it orbits
sometimes
the earth's the northern hemisphere is
pointed away from the sun
so if you're closer to the sun what
happens of course it's warmer
if you're away from the sun of course
it's colder
and this happens of course for the
northern and the southern hemisphere
that's why when it's december right
that means that the earth is tilted on
its axis north-south axis
the north part of the earth is facing
away from the sun
the southern part is closer to the sun
so in
what i say december january in that time
we have winter in the northern
hemisphere but it's summer
in the southern hemisphere so when it's
winter in new york
it is summer in sydney australia
okay that's don't forget that and then
the opposite happens
when the earth is rotating oh sorry is
the earth is orbiting
it's also moving you know the axis might
turn
so that now the northern hemisphere is
closer to the sun
the southern hemisphere is further from
the sun so now it's summer in new york
and winter in sydney and that is why we
have the seasons
so it's kind of an interesting thing to
think about right how the earth
you know all not only is it orbiting but
the it's orbiting on an axis and it's
also rotating right
now these things cause days right it
causes daylight 24 hours
right because of the rotation but the
seasons are caused because
it's rotating on an axis and as it moves
the the direction of that axis is either
towards the sun
or away from the sun as it moves around
the sun very interesting now if you're
very interested in this by the way you
might consider
being an astronomer astronomer an
astronomer is someone
who studies these things they study
planets they study the sun
they study the motions of what they call
the heavenly bodies right
the mars not the mars just mars mars
venus
mercury jupiter saturn and they find
many interesting and strange things
about the motion
and they find different worlds too did
you know also it's an
interesting fact that the moon right the
moon
orbits the earth but the moon is
rotating at the same rate
as its orbiting so you always see the
same part of the moon
you always see the same part of the moon
as always facing
the earth that's an interesting fact
right you never see
the other side of the moon we only see
one side of the moon
interesting okay okay but anyway that's
a dif that's a that may be another unit
or another lesson okay so anyway this is
why the earth has
seasons why do we have spring summer
fall and winter that is the reasons
because the motion
and it's tilting on an axis as it
rotates and as it orbits
the sun okay very interesting next
now we can see the earth's movement when
you see when you look at a shadow on a
sunny day right it's a sunny day
not any clouds in the in the sky we can
see the sun very easily
and the sun is shining light on the
surface of the earth
now we look at a tree right and we see
the tree and we see the shadow under the
tree
the shadow seems to move during the day
right
from the morning to the evening the
shadow will
sh will change its position what's going
on
well in the morning the sun is low in
the sky
now in this picture right if i'm looking
at this picture this way
right i have to imagine the sun is over
here and it's morning time so the sun is
to the east
it's the light is hitting the tree and
the shadow
is to the west the shadow is uh pointing
out to the west
so the sun is low in the sky shadows are
long because the direction of the light
is hitting the tree
at an angle right and so that makes a
long shadow
shadows are long we say shadows are long
or shadows are short
you know how tall or how long
is the shadow how much distance does the
shadow
have right if it's a lot of distance we
say the shadow is long
but as the day progresses and the sun
climbs
climbs higher it's not climbing the
earth is moving but as the sun
seems to move higher in the sky that
shadow becomes
shorter right as the earth rotates
shadows change length and position right
so at noon think about the earth is
turning so at noon the sun
seems to be directly over your head when
so the shadow is at its smallest it's
right underneath the object that is
blocking the light
so the sun is at its highest point in
the sky shadows are the
shortest they they occupy the smallest
area because it's straight down
now the sun is moving of course to the
west where it will
set and as it moves over to the west now
it's hitting the tree at the opposite
angle
and so the shadow becomes long and now
it's stretching over to the east right
sun is in the west
hits the tree and the shadow is created
in the east on to the east
of the tree so the sun is low in the sky
again
shadows grow longer so this is also you
know you don't have to look at the sun
right when you're out in the day you're
having a great day you're out hiking
you're
having a picnic you're flying a kite you
kind of look at the shower say oh the
shadows are getting long it's getting
time for dinner
i should start thinking about going back
home right so that's a good
thing to remember when you're outside in
a sunny day just watch the shadows if
their shadows are short yeah you've got
lots of time left
for sunlight but as the shadows get
longer and longer
in the afternoon yeah it's getting time
for dinner time
mama's going to call me soon for dinner
okay so keep that in mind
when you're out in the sunshine okay
and those are our main ideas for this
lesson next we're going to take a look
at the reading section
okay let's do the reading together and
as usual
read along with me maybe silently in
your mind or out loud to practice
pronunciation
let's start earth's axis
is an imaginary line that goes through
it
earth rotates around its axis
once in 24 hours and that's why
a day is 24 hours long
24 hours long
okay good half of earth
always faces the sun there
it is the day there is light
the other half of the earth does not
face the sun
there it is the night there
is darkness
sunrise is when the sun first appears
in the sky it is the start of the day
sunset is when the sun disappears from
the sky
it is the start of night
the rotating earth causes night
and day the earth's axis is tilted
part of earth tilts towards the sun
it gets more sunlight and it is warmer
than the other part
earth orbits the sun in one year
the part of earth that tilts toward the
sun slowly
changes this is why the seasons
change okay very good let's take a look
at how the
information in this paragraph is
organized
here we have main ideas and details the
main idea as we talked about before
you know the explanation the sun moving
around i'm sorry the explanation of the
earth moving around the sun
is what causes day night and seasons
so that's the main idea we can see first
of all
what how is day cost that's the first
detail in that supports this main idea
so day night and seasons
how are day and how is night formed okay
so first
earth peep once in 24 hours from the
reading passage we
and from the vocabulary we saw that the
earth
will turn rotate on its axis how how
long does it take to make
one revolution to go around one time to
start
here go around and come back to the same
place
it takes 24 hours it rotates
once in 24 hours rotate so that's one
rotation
it rotates once in 24 hours
and rotate is the verb rotation
is the noun it takes one rotation
to make one day okay
it rotates around an imaginary line
called
an axis we talked about that before
axis and remember the axis can be
straight up and down
or it can be tilted right beep
is the start of night right so as the
earth rotates it seems like the sun
is going down right we call that sun
set sun
set and beep
is the start of the day so when this
sun seems to come up seems to rise over
the horizon
we call that sunrise
there's a very famous song going through
my head it's an
old movie called fiddler on the roof
they're talking about sunrise
sunset okay anyway it's an old song okay
so
sunrise is the start of the day sunset
is the start of night okay 24 hours
now i didn't explain before it's kind of
interesting if if this is the earth
right if you're at the equator right
it doesn't really matter if the earth is
rotating
at a tilt or straight up and down it's
usually 12 hours
day 12 hours night but as you go further
north
right that changes a lot sometimes some
people don't get
if you're way up here you don't get any
sun at all
during the winter time when the earth is
pointed away from the sun
that of course also makes it a lot
colder no sunlight no energy
it makes it colder so that's another
reason why you get winter and we talked
about that
so um so that how much
sunlight and how much night depends on
your uh uh latitude latitude is you know
how far
north or south are you from the equator
right okay so that's interesting the
further you go north
the less sunlight you have in the winter
same in the south
and southern direction southern
direction if you're further south you
have
longer days in the winter okay
and uh shorter days the further you go
north
okay good okay so earth peep
the sun so we're in the first two
sections we're talking about you know
rotate the rotation of the earth but
don't forget the earth is also making
another
another movement what do we call that
movement as it goes around the sun
it goes around the sun it orbits the sun
so earth
orbits the sun now we're talking about
seasons
so earth orbits the sun the part of the
earth that um
tilts right so we talked about this word
tilt
and i just explained it too right this
is the axis so
at this time if the sun is over here and
that would be huge right
that's the sun so right now the earth is
if it's rotating like this and the axis
is like this
this part of the earth its tilt tilted
towards the sun
but as it moves as it rotates the axis
will change right now of course that
would be on the other side
the axis might be like this and now the
northern part is tilted away from the
sun
they get less sunlight the days are
shorter
less energy from the sun it gets colder
right
so tilts towards the sun the part of the
earth that tilts towards the sun slowly
changes
that's why seasons change so if you're
tilted towards the sun
the northern hemisphere tilted towards
the sun it's summertime
summertime here winter time in the
southern part
if you're in the northern hemisphere
you're tilted away from the sun
then you have winter in the north and
the southern part is tilted towards the
sun
they have summer so tilt
toward or tilt
away from
right so when we use tilt we can say
the northern hemisphere tilts toward the
sun
or the northern hemisphere tilts away
from the sun
this tells you which direction the axis
is pointing it is it towards something
or is it away from something
okay so good well this is all very
interesting if you're interested in this
in this uh idea or the
ideas of the planets and how they move
and where they came from again
astronomy is a very interesting subject
and i encourage you to read more about
it read more about uh
the the earth and the moon and the
different planets and the stars it's all
very fascinating
very interesting information that you
can learn
okay well that's it for this lesson i
hope that you learned a lot it's
it's kind of interesting information i'm
interested in it i hope that you are too
and uh so i hope this was a useful
lesson to you and also that you learned
a lot of vocabulary and a lot of
interesting ideas about you know why do
we have day and night
and why are there seasons okay well
thanks for studying with me as always
we'll see in the next one take care
everybody
you

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading i'm brian stewart
00:13
and in this lesson we're taking a look
00:15
at science book 3
00:16
lesson 10. wow lesson 10 already we're
00:20
moving fast
00:21
so in this lesson you will discover how
00:25
earth's orbit makes seasons
00:28
and also how shadows change
00:32
during the day so interesting lesson
00:35
ahead
00:36
as always let's start with the
00:38
vocabulary our first
00:40
word is axis axis
00:44
is an interesting word an axis is a line
00:47
around which something turns now here we
00:50
have an interesting picture it looks a
00:52
little
00:52
complicated right but it's an important
00:55
picture
00:56
and it's important idea to think about
00:58
because when we think about the earth
01:00
right we have
01:00
the north and the south on the north is
01:03
on the top
01:04
and south is on the bottom but it's not
01:06
exactly
01:07
top and bottom it's a little bit like
01:10
this
01:11
and that line is not a straight line up
01:13
and down
01:14
it's kind of a diagonal line and that
01:18
is the axis now the earth turns
01:21
around that axis the earth doesn't turn
01:23
around a line that's straight up and
01:25
down
01:25
the earth turns around a line that is
01:28
tilted
01:29
a little bit and we'll look at tilt in a
01:31
little bit but it's it's not straight up
01:32
and down
01:33
it's on its side just a little bit and
01:35
the earth
01:36
turns like this so axis a line around
01:39
which something
01:40
turns okay so if you have a top if you
01:43
have a spinning toy right you spin it
01:46
the axis is straight up and down but
01:48
after that
01:49
toy loses energy it begins
01:52
to do this and the access
01:56
moves it's not straight up and down
01:57
anymore it moves from side to side
02:00
that is the axis okay good next
02:04
tilt what i just talked about right
02:08
the line uh if you spin that toy
02:11
right and it's it's spinning at the
02:13
beginning there's no tilt
02:15
it's straight up and down but like i
02:16
said as it loses energy
02:18
it begins to move like this and it tilts
02:21
from side to side
02:22
now the earth doesn't do that very
02:24
quickly right the earth isn't losing
02:26
energy
02:27
as fast as their your top thank goodness
02:30
okay
02:31
so but the earth doesn't spin straight
02:33
up and down it
02:34
is at a tilt tilt means to cause
02:37
something to be in a sloping
02:39
position sloping position we can also
02:43
say
02:45
diagonal diagonal
02:47
right this would be a straight line up
02:50
and down
02:51
this is a diagonal line so if something
02:54
moves around on an axis that's at um and
02:57
it's not a straight up and down line
02:59
it's it's tilting a little bit okay and
03:02
the earth does this that's a very
03:03
important thing to know
03:05
and to remember okay tilt
03:08
orbit now another thing that's going on
03:11
independent
03:12
of the rotation of the earth is that the
03:14
earth is moving
03:16
around the sun for a long time people
03:18
thought the sun
03:19
moved around the earth but no it doesn't
03:21
happen that way the sun
03:23
stays put well the sun moves everything
03:25
is moving
03:26
but in our solar system if you just look
03:29
at the solar system the sun
03:30
is stationary it doesn't move and the
03:32
planets
03:33
orbit around the sun so orbit is to move
03:36
around something
03:37
in a continuous curving
03:40
path it might not be a perfect circle in
03:43
fact
03:44
some planets have they're not in a
03:46
perfect circle they're a little bit
03:48
um long or are short in some parts
03:51
depending on which part of the circle
03:52
you're looking at
03:53
we call that an oval right but if
03:55
something moves around
03:57
something right we call that an orbit
03:59
and the earth is orbiting the sun
04:01
the moon is orbiting the earth right and
04:05
all the other planets jupiter saturn
04:07
neptune uh mercury venus mars
04:10
all of them are orbiting the sun okay so
04:13
to orbit
04:14
to move around something in a continuous
04:17
curving
04:18
path rotate so
04:21
the earth is doing really two main
04:24
motions right the earth is
04:25
moving in an orbit but at the same time
04:29
it's also turning on its axis so there
04:32
are two
04:32
important motions to think about here
04:34
right the earth is moving this way
04:36
but as it moves it's also spinning
04:39
right that's interesting okay so that
04:42
and that spinning motion
04:44
we say it is rotating so to turn
04:47
with a circular movement and why is that
04:50
important let's talk about that
04:53
because if the earth didn't rotate we
04:55
wouldn't have
04:56
sunrises right so the earth is moving
04:59
like this
05:00
as it goes around the sun and because
05:01
it's rotating very fast
05:03
relative to the speed at which it goes
05:06
around the sun
05:07
the part different parts of the earth
05:10
are
05:11
shown to the sun at different times
05:14
and it takes 24 hours to fully rotate
05:18
to spin around once and because of that
05:22
our day is 24 hours long right and the
05:25
start of the day is sunrise when the
05:27
earth turns and you live in this part of
05:28
the earth
05:29
the earth turns the sun seems to rise
05:32
the sun doesn't rise right as i said the
05:35
sun doesn't move
05:36
but we are on earth we don't know we're
05:39
moving right because we're that's the
05:40
you know we were born this way
05:42
we're just used to the motion we don't
05:44
think of it as we're moving
05:45
right right now you're probably sitting
05:48
at your desk
05:49
watching this on your computer screen or
05:51
maybe on your cell phone
05:53
but you feel i'm not moving yes you are
05:55
we're all moving very quickly
05:57
we're moving like this we're also moving
05:59
like this okay
06:00
so it looks like the sun is coming up
06:04
over the edge of the land it's not
06:06
really coming up it's just because the
06:08
earth is turning
06:09
that we call it sunrise so the sun seems
06:12
to
06:12
rise in the morning the time in the
06:14
morning when you first see the sun
06:17
we call that sunrise and we have a video
06:19
of that
06:20
and as you can see it's morning you
06:22
can't tell is it morning or is it
06:23
evening well if you just wait a little
06:25
bit right you can see oh there's the sun
06:27
it's coming up we see it gradually
06:29
coming up over the mountains now it's
06:31
not very quick
06:32
i mean it it seems kind of quick sure
06:35
but
06:36
thankfully the day isn't you know really
06:37
fast okay
06:40
and we have a lot of hours to enjoy the
06:43
sunlight and
06:43
and to do the things we need to do
06:45
during the day but the sun
06:47
seems to come up over the mountains oh
06:49
we can also call this
06:51
the horizon horizon
06:55
so the horizon is the edge of our site
06:58
right and in this case it's very easy
07:00
it's the mountains but if it's flat
07:02
right the if there are no mountains the
07:04
horizon would be down here
07:05
right okay good
07:09
what is the opposite of sunrise of
07:10
course that is sunset the sun
07:12
seems to fall down and disappear
07:16
over the horizon this is the horizon
07:18
here right the edge of the land
07:20
or the sea in this case the edge of the
07:22
water
07:23
sunset is the time in the evening when
07:25
you last see
07:27
the sun bye bye son we'll see you in the
07:29
morning
07:30
okay so when you last see the sun that
07:33
is
07:34
the sunset okay those are the words for
07:37
vocabulary today okay let's take a look
07:41
at
07:41
a main idea of this passage and we're
07:43
talking about
07:45
the earth's motion around the sun and
07:47
how it causes the different
07:49
seasons here we have the different
07:51
seasons we have spring
07:53
we have summer we have fall and we have
07:56
winter
07:56
have you ever wondered why there are
07:58
different seasons
08:00
well the seasons are caused by the
08:01
earth's rotation remember there are two
08:03
main
08:04
there are two main uh they're not caused
08:06
by the earth's rotation by the earth's
08:07
movement and there are two main
08:09
movements of the earth around the sun so
08:12
first earth always rotates
08:15
in the same direction right it always
08:17
goes around
08:18
in this uh circular motion right
08:22
it doesn't suddenly stop and go back
08:24
that would be crazy right
08:25
besides how would it do that where would
08:27
it get the energy to do that
08:29
right when the solar system was formed
08:31
it was all spinning
08:32
in a certain direction right and that's
08:35
why all the planets
08:36
and the sun rotates too everything is
08:39
rotating
08:40
and orbiting in the same direction uh
08:44
and that's kind of interesting okay so
08:46
earth's rotation
08:48
causes the seasons to change why is that
08:51
remember there's two things going on the
08:53
earth is tilted right
08:54
and it's moving around the sun so it's
08:57
tilted like this
08:58
well sometimes that tilt means that the
09:01
northern hemisphere the northern part
09:05
of the earth is sometimes pointed
09:08
towards the sun right but as it orbits
09:12
sometimes
09:13
the earth's the northern hemisphere is
09:15
pointed away from the sun
09:17
so if you're closer to the sun what
09:18
happens of course it's warmer
09:20
if you're away from the sun of course
09:23
it's colder
09:24
and this happens of course for the
09:25
northern and the southern hemisphere
09:27
that's why when it's december right
09:31
that means that the earth is tilted on
09:34
its axis north-south axis
09:35
the north part of the earth is facing
09:38
away from the sun
09:39
the southern part is closer to the sun
09:41
so in
09:42
what i say december january in that time
09:45
we have winter in the northern
09:46
hemisphere but it's summer
09:48
in the southern hemisphere so when it's
09:50
winter in new york
09:52
it is summer in sydney australia
09:55
okay that's don't forget that and then
09:57
the opposite happens
09:59
when the earth is rotating oh sorry is
10:02
the earth is orbiting
10:03
it's also moving you know the axis might
10:06
turn
10:07
so that now the northern hemisphere is
10:09
closer to the sun
10:10
the southern hemisphere is further from
10:12
the sun so now it's summer in new york
10:15
and winter in sydney and that is why we
10:18
have the seasons
10:19
so it's kind of an interesting thing to
10:21
think about right how the earth
10:23
you know all not only is it orbiting but
10:24
the it's orbiting on an axis and it's
10:26
also rotating right
10:28
now these things cause days right it
10:30
causes daylight 24 hours
10:33
right because of the rotation but the
10:35
seasons are caused because
10:36
it's rotating on an axis and as it moves
10:40
the the direction of that axis is either
10:42
towards the sun
10:43
or away from the sun as it moves around
10:46
the sun very interesting now if you're
10:49
very interested in this by the way you
10:51
might consider
10:52
being an astronomer astronomer an
10:56
astronomer is someone
10:58
who studies these things they study
11:00
planets they study the sun
11:01
they study the motions of what they call
11:04
the heavenly bodies right
11:06
the mars not the mars just mars mars
11:09
venus
11:10
mercury jupiter saturn and they find
11:14
many interesting and strange things
11:16
about the motion
11:17
and they find different worlds too did
11:19
you know also it's an
11:20
interesting fact that the moon right the
11:24
moon
11:24
orbits the earth but the moon is
11:27
rotating at the same rate
11:29
as its orbiting so you always see the
11:32
same part of the moon
11:34
you always see the same part of the moon
11:35
as always facing
11:37
the earth that's an interesting fact
11:39
right you never see
11:40
the other side of the moon we only see
11:43
one side of the moon
11:44
interesting okay okay but anyway that's
11:47
a dif that's a that may be another unit
11:49
or another lesson okay so anyway this is
11:51
why the earth has
11:53
seasons why do we have spring summer
11:55
fall and winter that is the reasons
11:57
because the motion
11:58
and it's tilting on an axis as it
12:00
rotates and as it orbits
12:02
the sun okay very interesting next
12:06
now we can see the earth's movement when
12:09
you see when you look at a shadow on a
12:10
sunny day right it's a sunny day
12:13
not any clouds in the in the sky we can
12:15
see the sun very easily
12:16
and the sun is shining light on the
12:19
surface of the earth
12:20
now we look at a tree right and we see
12:23
the tree and we see the shadow under the
12:25
tree
12:26
the shadow seems to move during the day
12:28
right
12:29
from the morning to the evening the
12:31
shadow will
12:32
sh will change its position what's going
12:35
on
12:36
well in the morning the sun is low in
12:38
the sky
12:39
now in this picture right if i'm looking
12:41
at this picture this way
12:42
right i have to imagine the sun is over
12:44
here and it's morning time so the sun is
12:46
to the east
12:48
it's the light is hitting the tree and
12:50
the shadow
12:51
is to the west the shadow is uh pointing
12:54
out to the west
12:54
so the sun is low in the sky shadows are
12:57
long because the direction of the light
12:59
is hitting the tree
13:00
at an angle right and so that makes a
13:02
long shadow
13:03
shadows are long we say shadows are long
13:06
or shadows are short
13:07
you know how tall or how long
13:10
is the shadow how much distance does the
13:13
shadow
13:13
have right if it's a lot of distance we
13:16
say the shadow is long
13:18
but as the day progresses and the sun
13:20
climbs
13:21
climbs higher it's not climbing the
13:22
earth is moving but as the sun
13:24
seems to move higher in the sky that
13:27
shadow becomes
13:28
shorter right as the earth rotates
13:31
shadows change length and position right
13:35
so at noon think about the earth is
13:37
turning so at noon the sun
13:39
seems to be directly over your head when
13:42
so the shadow is at its smallest it's
13:46
right underneath the object that is
13:48
blocking the light
13:49
so the sun is at its highest point in
13:51
the sky shadows are the
13:53
shortest they they occupy the smallest
13:56
area because it's straight down
13:58
now the sun is moving of course to the
14:00
west where it will
14:02
set and as it moves over to the west now
14:05
it's hitting the tree at the opposite
14:06
angle
14:07
and so the shadow becomes long and now
14:10
it's stretching over to the east right
14:11
sun is in the west
14:13
hits the tree and the shadow is created
14:16
in the east on to the east
14:17
of the tree so the sun is low in the sky
14:20
again
14:20
shadows grow longer so this is also you
14:24
know you don't have to look at the sun
14:25
right when you're out in the day you're
14:27
having a great day you're out hiking
14:29
you're
14:29
having a picnic you're flying a kite you
14:32
kind of look at the shower say oh the
14:33
shadows are getting long it's getting
14:35
time for dinner
14:36
i should start thinking about going back
14:38
home right so that's a good
14:40
thing to remember when you're outside in
14:42
a sunny day just watch the shadows if
14:44
their shadows are short yeah you've got
14:45
lots of time left
14:47
for sunlight but as the shadows get
14:49
longer and longer
14:50
in the afternoon yeah it's getting time
14:52
for dinner time
14:53
mama's going to call me soon for dinner
14:55
okay so keep that in mind
14:57
when you're out in the sunshine okay
15:01
and those are our main ideas for this
15:03
lesson next we're going to take a look
15:04
at the reading section
15:07
okay let's do the reading together and
15:10
as usual
15:11
read along with me maybe silently in
15:14
your mind or out loud to practice
15:15
pronunciation
15:17
let's start earth's axis
15:20
is an imaginary line that goes through
15:22
it
15:23
earth rotates around its axis
15:26
once in 24 hours and that's why
15:30
a day is 24 hours long
15:34
24 hours long
15:38
okay good half of earth
15:42
always faces the sun there
15:46
it is the day there is light
15:50
the other half of the earth does not
15:52
face the sun
15:53
there it is the night there
15:57
is darkness
16:01
sunrise is when the sun first appears
16:04
in the sky it is the start of the day
16:09
sunset is when the sun disappears from
16:12
the sky
16:13
it is the start of night
16:18
the rotating earth causes night
16:21
and day the earth's axis is tilted
16:25
part of earth tilts towards the sun
16:29
it gets more sunlight and it is warmer
16:32
than the other part
16:36
earth orbits the sun in one year
16:40
the part of earth that tilts toward the
16:42
sun slowly
16:43
changes this is why the seasons
16:47
change okay very good let's take a look
16:50
at how the
16:51
information in this paragraph is
16:54
organized
16:57
here we have main ideas and details the
17:00
main idea as we talked about before
17:02
you know the explanation the sun moving
17:04
around i'm sorry the explanation of the
17:06
earth moving around the sun
17:08
is what causes day night and seasons
17:12
so that's the main idea we can see first
17:16
of all
17:17
what how is day cost that's the first
17:20
detail in that supports this main idea
17:23
so day night and seasons
17:25
how are day and how is night formed okay
17:28
so first
17:29
earth peep once in 24 hours from the
17:33
reading passage we
17:34
and from the vocabulary we saw that the
17:37
earth
17:37
will turn rotate on its axis how how
17:40
long does it take to make
17:42
one revolution to go around one time to
17:45
start
17:46
here go around and come back to the same
17:48
place
17:49
it takes 24 hours it rotates
17:52
once in 24 hours rotate so that's one
17:55
rotation
17:56
it rotates once in 24 hours
18:00
and rotate is the verb rotation
18:06
is the noun it takes one rotation
18:09
to make one day okay
18:12
it rotates around an imaginary line
18:15
called
18:16
an axis we talked about that before
18:19
axis and remember the axis can be
18:22
straight up and down
18:23
or it can be tilted right beep
18:26
is the start of night right so as the
18:29
earth rotates it seems like the sun
18:31
is going down right we call that sun
18:35
set sun
18:38
set and beep
18:41
is the start of the day so when this
18:45
sun seems to come up seems to rise over
18:48
the horizon
18:49
we call that sunrise
18:53
there's a very famous song going through
18:55
my head it's an
18:56
old movie called fiddler on the roof
18:59
they're talking about sunrise
19:00
sunset okay anyway it's an old song okay
19:03
so
19:04
sunrise is the start of the day sunset
19:07
is the start of night okay 24 hours
19:11
now i didn't explain before it's kind of
19:13
interesting if if this is the earth
19:15
right if you're at the equator right
19:17
it doesn't really matter if the earth is
19:19
rotating
19:21
at a tilt or straight up and down it's
19:23
usually 12 hours
19:25
day 12 hours night but as you go further
19:29
north
19:29
right that changes a lot sometimes some
19:31
people don't get
19:33
if you're way up here you don't get any
19:36
sun at all
19:37
during the winter time when the earth is
19:39
pointed away from the sun
19:40
that of course also makes it a lot
19:42
colder no sunlight no energy
19:44
it makes it colder so that's another
19:46
reason why you get winter and we talked
19:48
about that
19:49
so um so that how much
19:52
sunlight and how much night depends on
19:56
your uh uh latitude latitude is you know
20:00
how far
20:00
north or south are you from the equator
20:04
right okay so that's interesting the
20:06
further you go north
20:08
the less sunlight you have in the winter
20:10
same in the south
20:11
and southern direction southern
20:13
direction if you're further south you
20:15
have
20:15
longer days in the winter okay
20:18
and uh shorter days the further you go
20:22
north
20:23
okay good okay so earth peep
20:26
the sun so we're in the first two
20:29
sections we're talking about you know
20:30
rotate the rotation of the earth but
20:32
don't forget the earth is also making
20:34
another
20:35
another movement what do we call that
20:38
movement as it goes around the sun
20:40
it goes around the sun it orbits the sun
20:43
so earth
20:44
orbits the sun now we're talking about
20:45
seasons
20:47
so earth orbits the sun the part of the
20:50
earth that um
20:54
tilts right so we talked about this word
20:58
tilt
20:59
and i just explained it too right this
21:01
is the axis so
21:02
at this time if the sun is over here and
21:04
that would be huge right
21:06
that's the sun so right now the earth is
21:09
if it's rotating like this and the axis
21:11
is like this
21:12
this part of the earth its tilt tilted
21:15
towards the sun
21:16
but as it moves as it rotates the axis
21:19
will change right now of course that
21:21
would be on the other side
21:23
the axis might be like this and now the
21:24
northern part is tilted away from the
21:26
sun
21:27
they get less sunlight the days are
21:29
shorter
21:30
less energy from the sun it gets colder
21:33
right
21:34
so tilts towards the sun the part of the
21:36
earth that tilts towards the sun slowly
21:38
changes
21:39
that's why seasons change so if you're
21:42
tilted towards the sun
21:43
the northern hemisphere tilted towards
21:45
the sun it's summertime
21:47
summertime here winter time in the
21:49
southern part
21:51
if you're in the northern hemisphere
21:52
you're tilted away from the sun
21:55
then you have winter in the north and
21:57
the southern part is tilted towards the
21:59
sun
22:00
they have summer so tilt
22:03
toward or tilt
22:07
away from
22:10
right so when we use tilt we can say
22:14
the northern hemisphere tilts toward the
22:17
sun
22:18
or the northern hemisphere tilts away
22:21
from the sun
22:22
this tells you which direction the axis
22:25
is pointing it is it towards something
22:27
or is it away from something
22:29
okay so good well this is all very
22:31
interesting if you're interested in this
22:33
in this uh idea or the
22:36
ideas of the planets and how they move
22:39
and where they came from again
22:40
astronomy is a very interesting subject
22:44
and i encourage you to read more about
22:46
it read more about uh
22:48
the the earth and the moon and the
22:50
different planets and the stars it's all
22:52
very fascinating
22:53
very interesting information that you
22:55
can learn
22:56
okay well that's it for this lesson i
22:58
hope that you learned a lot it's
23:00
it's kind of interesting information i'm
23:02
interested in it i hope that you are too
23:04
and uh so i hope this was a useful
23:07
lesson to you and also that you learned
23:08
a lot of vocabulary and a lot of
23:10
interesting ideas about you know why do
23:12
we have day and night
23:13
and why are there seasons okay well
23:15
thanks for studying with me as always
23:17
we'll see in the next one take care
23:20
everybody
23:26
you
