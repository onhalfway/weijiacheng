hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading series i'm your host brian
stewart
and we are studying social studies book
three lesson or unit
three types of communities
so there are many types of communities
in this unit we will discover the
different places
where we live and how
to describe them how can we describe the
different places that we live
okay so as usual let's begin with the
vocabulary section
are you ready let's begin
okay in the vocabulary section our first
word
actually it's two words because it's an
adjective
and a noun adjective urban
noun area urban area
actually we can just call this a city or
a big town you probably live
in an urban area an urban area
is a large area with many
houses not just houses like one story
house
but big apartment buildings right
lots of stores many office buildings
lots of streets many cars going
back and forth be careful in an urban
area
especially on the streets
so an urban area is usually in a big
city
or a large town okay that's an urban
area
many people living close together that
is an
urban area okay now a suburb
many cities right downtown in the cities
you know like lots of office buildings
lots of cars
many people rushing back and forth
now those people probably work downtown
because there's many
office buildings but when they want to
go home
they don't want to stay in a very busy
noisy
area they want to go out they want to go
outside the city
so there are many smaller more quiet
places
outside the city with maybe homes
where one family lives in one building
it's a
one-story maybe a two-story building
and there's many trees and the streets
are wider
not as much traffic so a suburb
is an area near a city usually there are
many
houses in a suburb not
many businesses maybe a grocery store
maybe a laundromat something like that
to help people living there
but usually it's just houses houses
houses
houses houses everywhere okay
that's a suburb next
we have crowded now crowded
we think of an urban area right we just
learned urban area
urban area there are many people living
and working close together
it's filled with lots of people it's
very
crowded okay and we have things like
crowded buses if you go to a city
on a bus the bus gets more and more
people
until it's very crowded it's filled with
many people
so that is crowded okay
next we have subway sub
means under way is a path
so it's an underway underpath right
it's un usually subways are underground
they're below the street
you know sure sometimes the subway comes
up and you can see it on a bridge or
something
but usually the subway goes in a tunnel
underground
under the city where it can go really
fast and carry many people
from one place to another so a subway
system
is a railroad system railroad it's like
a
train and it's on a track you have rail
one rail two rails it's a rail
road system and it goes many different
places so it's a system
which usually like i said runs
underground
sub under way underground
interesting word okay subway maybe you
take the subway to school
maybe your father or your mother takes
the subway to work
okay rural
area now if you get outside of the city
you may be in the mountains or in the
fields in the valleys
and there's lots of trees and there are
many fields and farmers
grow crops or raise animals
in the rural area we also call this the
countryside
because it's a natural area it hasn't
been developed
yes there's maybe a house here a road
here but most of the area is natural
it has trees it has grass it has
running water rivers mountains
it's very beautiful the air is fresh
okay so that's the rural area that's the
countryside
next we have a field like i said in the
countryside
farmers may grow plants and they may
grow plants in a big
field a field is an open ground it's
usually flat
right usually it could have an angle but
usually it's
flat where people grow plants
right so if you grow rice it's a rice
field
if you grow corn it's a corn field
but a field is a place of open ground
where people farmers grow plants
okay that's a field also by the way you
can also have a field
where you play sports so you could have
a baseball field
or a soccer field it's not just for
plants
it's an open area used for some
reason okay
next we have office building where do
you find
an office building yes you find an
office building in an urban area right
in the city
you find an office building so an office
building of course
is a large building it has many stories
it has many floors floor one to floor
50. wow it's a really tall building
right
so it's a large building containing many
offices many people go there they have a
desk
they have a computer and they have a
phone well like maybe their cell phone
nowadays
but they do work they meet other people
they plan projects they do
work in an office building it's where
your mom or your dad goes
for his or her job okay so office
building
now the next word is an adjective it
describes
what a place is like now think about
this
is an urban area noisy or is a rural
area noisy well usually we think about
urban areas being noisy
because noisy means making loud
unpleasant sounds so
if you're in the city you can hear cars
beeping their horn beep beep you can
hear
construction workers using machinery
to break the ground right you can hear
the subway
you know going uh underground sometimes
they have the vents
you can hear the noise click click click
click there's all these
loud unpleasant noises around you
as you're in the city so that's another
reason
people don't like to live in the city
they want to live in the suburbs
or in the countryside because it's
quieter
it's not noisy so in the city it's very
noisy
next we have quiet quiet is the
opposite of noisy in the countryside
it is quiet yes you might have cows
going
in the morning you have roosters going
right so that's noisy but usually it's
very quiet and calm and
peaceful in the countryside so quiet is
making
very little sound it's also what your
teacher says
when you're supposed to take a test or
study by yourself your teacher might say
be quiet don't make noise
okay good
let's talk about different types of
communities
now we have different types of
communities here we have three different
types of communities we can see on this
page
the first one is the urban area as i
said the city
right the urban area and in the urban
area
what can you see well you can see
that there are many there are many
people
lots of people many avenues streets
stores and skyscrapers
scott what is a skyscraper remember
office building
i said it has 50 floors wow
that's really tall it seems like it
reaches all the way up
and it scrapes scrape you know scrape
this is like scraping
you're scraping the sky because the
building is
so tall it seems like it's scraping the
sky
so we call that building a skyscraper
it touches the sky not really but it
seems like it
so we call it a skyscraper and there are
many places to work
of course skyscrapers are usually office
buildings and many people work there
there are many places to work
that's an urban area next we have a
suburb as i said people don't want to
live
in the city it's too noisy so they want
to go
outside the city not too far because
they have to come back every day
right so you don't want to have a very
long trip
back and forth every day so a suburb is
right next to the city
it's near the city a suburb is near a
city
and there is less traffic and fewer
jobs in a suburb than in a city
there's not many jobs in a suburb
because it's all houses
there's houses everywhere there's no
work really
unless you know maybe there's a grocery
store or a gas station
but they're very few jobs most jobs
are in the city so maybe you live in the
suburb
your mom or dad go into the city to work
and then they come
back to the suburb at night to meet you
have dinner
enjoy television and sleep
okay now we also have
rural area a rural area is
separate from the city not in the city
not in the suburbs
but further away from the city it's out
into nature
where there aren't many buildings there
aren't many streets
there aren't many cars there's lots of
open space grass trees
big sky right so rural areas
are far away from cities or
suburbs there is more open land
open land you can run right in rural
areas
than in cities or suburbs
and people live in small towns yes
in a rural area there might be a little
town here maybe 100 or 200
maybe a thousand a couple thousand maybe
people living in a small town but all
around is
rural area and it's very uh
natural and oh nice
air you can see many animals you can see
many plants
and it's very calm and a little quieter
than in the city so those are our three
different types
of communities okay
so we have three different types of
communities how can we describe them
what adjectives do we use
to describe a city urban area
a suburb or a rural area what
words what adjectives can we use
to describe these different places well
first
word the first adjective is busy
busy means there's a lot of action going
on
there's people going this way there's
people going that way there's people
coming this way
lots of different action is going on all
the time there's
cars right there are subways there's
buses
lots of action that is a very busy place
where do we find busy places when we use
the adjective busy
which area that's right an
urban area a city is very busy
okay good our next word is
crowded right lots of people all
together
in a small space right or maybe it's a
big space
but just lots of people so you know
there's people right next to you
in front of you and behind you there's
people all around you
then it is a crowded place which area
urban area suburb or rural area
which area would we use crowded with
that's right we would use crowded with
urban area or city because there's many
people in the city
and everybody's trying to go to work
right okay
our next word is quiet
not much noise very quiet you'll say
peaceful
right quiet so which area can we use or
can
we describe as being quiet
of course we would say our rural
area is quiet out in the countryside
it is quiet there aren't any cars
beeping their horns
there aren't people running around
talking on their cell phones
there's no construction noise it's very
quiet
and peaceful maybe there's cows and
roosters like i said but usually it's
pretty
quiet next we have
noisy where
would we call which area would we call
noisy hmm think about it ah of course
urban area an urban area is noisy
there's a lot of things going on right
there's many cars there's taxis there's
buses
there's people running this way and
running that way and there's noises of
construction
and garbage collectors all these
different things
make noise so it's very noisy in the
city
so those are some different words to
talk about
different places oh you notice i didn't
talk about suburbs right we talked about
three of them are for urban areas the
city
one was for countryside but we could
also say quiet is for suburbs too
because at night in the suburbs
and everybody's at home they're watching
tv so it could be quiet in the suburbs
as well
but three of those have to do with the
city okay interesting
let's move on now it's time to go over
the reading passage so
let's read a short passage about the
different
types of areas we just studied and of
course we'll
highlight the vocabulary that we learned
in the vocabulary section so as always
in your mind read along with me and if
you want to
uh speak as i'm speaking to practice
pronunciation
so in that way we can read together and
get a good
feeling and maybe remember the words in
the reading passage
okay okay let's begin together
here we go people
live in different types of
communities some
people live in urban
areas or cities
urban areas are noisy
with many cars and tall
office buildings where people
work
people who live in cities
are usually busy
families often live in suburban
areas suburban
areas are quieter than
urban areas there are
fewer cars and the buildings
are smaller
many people live in the suburbs
and work in the urban areas
every morning they take a crowded subway
or bus into the city
rural areas are far away
from urban areas
rural areas are quiet
with many fields
farmers grow various crops
and raise farm animals
there let me interrupt here i
just want to make a little point you
grow
crops grow plants you
raise animals okay
don't say grow animals
that sounds weird and don't say i
raise corn what you raise corn that
doesn't make sense
okay so grow crops
raise animals okay good
let's continue usually
they do not hurry like people
who live in urban areas
some people like the peace
and quiet of rural areas
better than the crowded noisy life
of the city that's true which do you
like better do you like the noisy
busy crazy life
in the city or do you like the calm
quiet peaceful life in the countryside
interesting question okay
okay now it's time for the reading skill
and the reading skill here
is to classify now do you remember from
the previous unit
i said to classify is to put
a nouns or things
ideas into different groups you classify
into different groups sometimes we can
say categories a category
is a group things that belong together
that's one group right then another
group and maybe another group here we
have
three different groups and they are all
areas different types of areas now
remember
it's going to be easy because we talked
about three different areas
we talked about an urban area or
city we talked about suburb suburbs or
suburban area did you see that in the
reading
and also a rural rural
area in the countryside so those are our
three areas
and then we have a clue on the other
side you know we see
the adjectives how do we describe them
so let's fill in the blanks
first of all we have the first section a
beep area
we don't know yet because we have to
read the clue
on the other side that the line goes to
the box that says
noisy many cars and
tall peep okay so
what uh first of all we can do b first
right let's do b first
so we have noisy many cars and tall
tall what remember skyscrapers what's
another word for
skyscrapers see if i can write this well
of course you know it it's actually
two words it's office
office building
okay okay office buildings noisy many
cars and tall
office buildings i put an s on there
because there are
more than one building there's many
buildings in the city
so obviously that's the area it's a city
we call it
an urban area urban
remember pronunciation urban
okay my handwriting is uh not so neat
with the pen but that's okay
okay next we have the next area
for c beep area what is the clue
what's the clue what's the how do we
describe it we say it's
quieter than urban areas that's our only
clue
but obviously if it's quieter than urban
areas
well we could either say it's either the
suburbs
or it's a rural area but before so
we have two choices right both are
quieter than urban areas
but what's what's uh what's d right
let's what's the clue for d
it says beep from urban areas many
fields ah okay
so many fields if there are many fields
farmers probably grow their crops or
raise animals in those
fields then we know that's a rural area
so we can do that here
we can put rural and that means
right before we had the choice quieter
than urban areas
rural areas and suburbs
right so but remember the adjective
for uh suburbs suburb is a noun
suburban we saw that in the text right
suburban is the adjective and area is a
noun
so we have to write suburban subur
[Music]
ben suburban so we have to add
a n here to make an adjective suburban
area okay so suburban area is quieter
than urban areas yes
rural area beep from urban areas many
fields
so in the reading passage remember what
it said about
rural areas right suburban areas are
near
urban areas they're close too because
you know people in the city who work in
the city they don't want to go very far
back and forth but in the rural area
they don't care they're not going to the
city
they in fact many people in the rural
area they don't want to be near the city
they want to be far away
from urban areas and that's our answer
so far
away from
actually these three words are a good
um our common uh
group uh collection of words far away
from
remember that far away from don't just
learn far
by itself far away but you know that's
far away it's okay but far away from
something else that's a good um group
to remember when you're studying english
right
far away from far away from what are you
far away from
i am far away from the city i am far
away from
my school okay so far away from some
things a good
uh group to remember together those
words okay so
very good well that is our lesson today
we talked about different types of
areas different types of communities oh
how to describe
those different types of communities and
we found that there were three different
types of communities and we know now
how to describe them so what kind of
community
do you like the best do you like to live
in an urban area
do you like to live in the suburbs or do
you like to live in the countryside
or rural area where do you want to live
when you grow up
it's a good thing to think about okay so
anyway that's our lesson today
thank you for studying with me as always
and we'll see you in the next lesson
take care bye bye
you

hello everybody
00:09
welcome back to american textbook
00:12
reading series i'm your host brian
00:15
stewart
00:16
and we are studying social studies book
00:19
three lesson or unit
00:22
three types of communities
00:27
so there are many types of communities
00:31
in this unit we will discover the
00:34
different places
00:36
where we live and how
00:39
to describe them how can we describe the
00:42
different places that we live
00:44
okay so as usual let's begin with the
00:47
vocabulary section
00:49
are you ready let's begin
00:54
okay in the vocabulary section our first
00:57
word
00:58
actually it's two words because it's an
01:00
adjective
01:01
and a noun adjective urban
01:04
noun area urban area
01:08
actually we can just call this a city or
01:11
a big town you probably live
01:14
in an urban area an urban area
01:18
is a large area with many
01:22
houses not just houses like one story
01:24
house
01:25
but big apartment buildings right
01:28
lots of stores many office buildings
01:32
lots of streets many cars going
01:35
back and forth be careful in an urban
01:38
area
01:39
especially on the streets
01:42
so an urban area is usually in a big
01:45
city
01:46
or a large town okay that's an urban
01:49
area
01:49
many people living close together that
01:52
is an
01:53
urban area okay now a suburb
01:57
many cities right downtown in the cities
02:00
you know like lots of office buildings
02:03
lots of cars
02:04
many people rushing back and forth
02:07
now those people probably work downtown
02:10
because there's many
02:11
office buildings but when they want to
02:13
go home
02:14
they don't want to stay in a very busy
02:17
noisy
02:17
area they want to go out they want to go
02:20
outside the city
02:21
so there are many smaller more quiet
02:24
places
02:25
outside the city with maybe homes
02:28
where one family lives in one building
02:31
it's a
02:32
one-story maybe a two-story building
02:35
and there's many trees and the streets
02:38
are wider
02:39
not as much traffic so a suburb
02:42
is an area near a city usually there are
02:45
many
02:46
houses in a suburb not
02:49
many businesses maybe a grocery store
02:52
maybe a laundromat something like that
02:56
to help people living there
02:57
but usually it's just houses houses
03:00
houses
03:01
houses houses everywhere okay
03:04
that's a suburb next
03:08
we have crowded now crowded
03:11
we think of an urban area right we just
03:14
learned urban area
03:15
urban area there are many people living
03:18
and working close together
03:20
it's filled with lots of people it's
03:23
very
03:23
crowded okay and we have things like
03:27
crowded buses if you go to a city
03:30
on a bus the bus gets more and more
03:32
people
03:33
until it's very crowded it's filled with
03:36
many people
03:37
so that is crowded okay
03:41
next we have subway sub
03:44
means under way is a path
03:48
so it's an underway underpath right
03:51
it's un usually subways are underground
03:54
they're below the street
03:56
you know sure sometimes the subway comes
03:58
up and you can see it on a bridge or
04:00
something
04:00
but usually the subway goes in a tunnel
04:03
underground
04:04
under the city where it can go really
04:06
fast and carry many people
04:08
from one place to another so a subway
04:11
system
04:12
is a railroad system railroad it's like
04:15
a
04:16
train and it's on a track you have rail
04:19
one rail two rails it's a rail
04:22
road system and it goes many different
04:25
places so it's a system
04:27
which usually like i said runs
04:30
underground
04:31
sub under way underground
04:34
interesting word okay subway maybe you
04:37
take the subway to school
04:39
maybe your father or your mother takes
04:42
the subway to work
04:44
okay rural
04:47
area now if you get outside of the city
04:50
you may be in the mountains or in the
04:53
fields in the valleys
04:55
and there's lots of trees and there are
04:58
many fields and farmers
05:00
grow crops or raise animals
05:03
in the rural area we also call this the
05:06
countryside
05:07
because it's a natural area it hasn't
05:10
been developed
05:11
yes there's maybe a house here a road
05:15
here but most of the area is natural
05:19
it has trees it has grass it has
05:22
running water rivers mountains
05:26
it's very beautiful the air is fresh
05:30
okay so that's the rural area that's the
05:32
countryside
05:35
next we have a field like i said in the
05:37
countryside
05:39
farmers may grow plants and they may
05:42
grow plants in a big
05:43
field a field is an open ground it's
05:46
usually flat
05:47
right usually it could have an angle but
05:49
usually it's
05:51
flat where people grow plants
05:54
right so if you grow rice it's a rice
05:56
field
05:57
if you grow corn it's a corn field
06:00
but a field is a place of open ground
06:04
where people farmers grow plants
06:08
okay that's a field also by the way you
06:10
can also have a field
06:12
where you play sports so you could have
06:15
a baseball field
06:17
or a soccer field it's not just for
06:20
plants
06:21
it's an open area used for some
06:24
reason okay
06:28
next we have office building where do
06:30
you find
06:31
an office building yes you find an
06:34
office building in an urban area right
06:38
in the city
06:39
you find an office building so an office
06:41
building of course
06:42
is a large building it has many stories
06:45
it has many floors floor one to floor
06:49
50. wow it's a really tall building
06:52
right
06:52
so it's a large building containing many
06:55
offices many people go there they have a
06:58
desk
06:59
they have a computer and they have a
07:01
phone well like maybe their cell phone
07:02
nowadays
07:03
but they do work they meet other people
07:06
they plan projects they do
07:10
work in an office building it's where
07:12
your mom or your dad goes
07:14
for his or her job okay so office
07:18
building
07:20
now the next word is an adjective it
07:23
describes
07:24
what a place is like now think about
07:28
this
07:29
is an urban area noisy or is a rural
07:33
area noisy well usually we think about
07:36
urban areas being noisy
07:40
because noisy means making loud
07:43
unpleasant sounds so
07:46
if you're in the city you can hear cars
07:49
beeping their horn beep beep you can
07:52
hear
07:52
construction workers using machinery
07:56
to break the ground right you can hear
07:59
the subway
08:00
you know going uh underground sometimes
08:03
they have the vents
08:04
you can hear the noise click click click
08:05
click there's all these
08:07
loud unpleasant noises around you
08:10
as you're in the city so that's another
08:13
reason
08:14
people don't like to live in the city
08:17
they want to live in the suburbs
08:19
or in the countryside because it's
08:21
quieter
08:22
it's not noisy so in the city it's very
08:25
noisy
08:28
next we have quiet quiet is the
08:31
opposite of noisy in the countryside
08:35
it is quiet yes you might have cows
08:38
going
08:40
in the morning you have roosters going
08:44
right so that's noisy but usually it's
08:47
very quiet and calm and
08:50
peaceful in the countryside so quiet is
08:54
making
08:54
very little sound it's also what your
08:57
teacher says
08:58
when you're supposed to take a test or
09:01
study by yourself your teacher might say
09:06
be quiet don't make noise
09:10
okay good
09:13
let's talk about different types of
09:16
communities
09:17
now we have different types of
09:18
communities here we have three different
09:21
types of communities we can see on this
09:24
page
09:25
the first one is the urban area as i
09:28
said the city
09:29
right the urban area and in the urban
09:33
area
09:34
what can you see well you can see
09:38
that there are many there are many
09:40
people
09:41
lots of people many avenues streets
09:45
stores and skyscrapers
09:49
scott what is a skyscraper remember
09:52
office building
09:53
i said it has 50 floors wow
09:56
that's really tall it seems like it
09:58
reaches all the way up
10:00
and it scrapes scrape you know scrape
10:03
this is like scraping
10:04
you're scraping the sky because the
10:07
building is
10:07
so tall it seems like it's scraping the
10:10
sky
10:11
so we call that building a skyscraper
10:15
it touches the sky not really but it
10:18
seems like it
10:19
so we call it a skyscraper and there are
10:22
many places to work
10:24
of course skyscrapers are usually office
10:27
buildings and many people work there
10:29
there are many places to work
10:31
that's an urban area next we have a
10:34
suburb as i said people don't want to
10:37
live
10:37
in the city it's too noisy so they want
10:40
to go
10:41
outside the city not too far because
10:43
they have to come back every day
10:45
right so you don't want to have a very
10:47
long trip
10:48
back and forth every day so a suburb is
10:51
right next to the city
10:53
it's near the city a suburb is near a
10:56
city
10:56
and there is less traffic and fewer
11:00
jobs in a suburb than in a city
11:03
there's not many jobs in a suburb
11:05
because it's all houses
11:07
there's houses everywhere there's no
11:09
work really
11:10
unless you know maybe there's a grocery
11:12
store or a gas station
11:14
but they're very few jobs most jobs
11:17
are in the city so maybe you live in the
11:20
suburb
11:21
your mom or dad go into the city to work
11:24
and then they come
11:24
back to the suburb at night to meet you
11:27
have dinner
11:28
enjoy television and sleep
11:31
okay now we also have
11:35
rural area a rural area is
11:38
separate from the city not in the city
11:41
not in the suburbs
11:42
but further away from the city it's out
11:44
into nature
11:46
where there aren't many buildings there
11:48
aren't many streets
11:50
there aren't many cars there's lots of
11:53
open space grass trees
11:56
big sky right so rural areas
12:00
are far away from cities or
12:03
suburbs there is more open land
12:07
open land you can run right in rural
12:10
areas
12:11
than in cities or suburbs
12:14
and people live in small towns yes
12:18
in a rural area there might be a little
12:20
town here maybe 100 or 200
12:23
maybe a thousand a couple thousand maybe
12:26
people living in a small town but all
12:28
around is
12:29
rural area and it's very uh
12:33
natural and oh nice
12:36
air you can see many animals you can see
12:38
many plants
12:40
and it's very calm and a little quieter
12:44
than in the city so those are our three
12:46
different types
12:47
of communities okay
12:54
so we have three different types of
12:56
communities how can we describe them
13:00
what adjectives do we use
13:03
to describe a city urban area
13:07
a suburb or a rural area what
13:10
words what adjectives can we use
13:14
to describe these different places well
13:17
first
13:18
word the first adjective is busy
13:22
busy means there's a lot of action going
13:25
on
13:26
there's people going this way there's
13:28
people going that way there's people
13:29
coming this way
13:31
lots of different action is going on all
13:33
the time there's
13:34
cars right there are subways there's
13:36
buses
13:38
lots of action that is a very busy place
13:42
where do we find busy places when we use
13:44
the adjective busy
13:46
which area that's right an
13:49
urban area a city is very busy
13:53
okay good our next word is
13:56
crowded right lots of people all
13:59
together
14:00
in a small space right or maybe it's a
14:02
big space
14:03
but just lots of people so you know
14:05
there's people right next to you
14:07
in front of you and behind you there's
14:09
people all around you
14:11
then it is a crowded place which area
14:15
urban area suburb or rural area
14:18
which area would we use crowded with
14:22
that's right we would use crowded with
14:24
urban area or city because there's many
14:26
people in the city
14:28
and everybody's trying to go to work
14:30
right okay
14:31
our next word is quiet
14:35
not much noise very quiet you'll say
14:38
peaceful
14:39
right quiet so which area can we use or
14:42
can
14:43
we describe as being quiet
14:47
of course we would say our rural
14:50
area is quiet out in the countryside
14:53
it is quiet there aren't any cars
14:56
beeping their horns
14:58
there aren't people running around
15:00
talking on their cell phones
15:02
there's no construction noise it's very
15:05
quiet
15:05
and peaceful maybe there's cows and
15:08
roosters like i said but usually it's
15:11
pretty
15:12
quiet next we have
15:15
noisy where
15:18
would we call which area would we call
15:22
noisy hmm think about it ah of course
15:25
urban area an urban area is noisy
15:28
there's a lot of things going on right
15:30
there's many cars there's taxis there's
15:32
buses
15:33
there's people running this way and
15:35
running that way and there's noises of
15:37
construction
15:38
and garbage collectors all these
15:41
different things
15:42
make noise so it's very noisy in the
15:46
city
15:47
so those are some different words to
15:48
talk about
15:50
different places oh you notice i didn't
15:52
talk about suburbs right we talked about
15:54
three of them are for urban areas the
15:58
city
15:59
one was for countryside but we could
16:01
also say quiet is for suburbs too
16:03
because at night in the suburbs
16:05
and everybody's at home they're watching
16:07
tv so it could be quiet in the suburbs
16:09
as well
16:10
but three of those have to do with the
16:12
city okay interesting
16:14
let's move on now it's time to go over
16:17
the reading passage so
16:19
let's read a short passage about the
16:22
different
16:23
types of areas we just studied and of
16:25
course we'll
16:26
highlight the vocabulary that we learned
16:30
in the vocabulary section so as always
16:34
in your mind read along with me and if
16:36
you want to
16:38
uh speak as i'm speaking to practice
16:41
pronunciation
16:43
so in that way we can read together and
16:46
get a good
16:46
feeling and maybe remember the words in
16:50
the reading passage
16:51
okay okay let's begin together
16:55
here we go people
16:58
live in different types of
17:02
communities some
17:04
people live in urban
17:07
areas or cities
17:12
urban areas are noisy
17:16
with many cars and tall
17:19
office buildings where people
17:22
work
17:27
people who live in cities
17:30
are usually busy
17:33
families often live in suburban
17:38
areas suburban
17:42
areas are quieter than
17:45
urban areas there are
17:48
fewer cars and the buildings
17:52
are smaller
17:55
many people live in the suburbs
17:59
and work in the urban areas
18:04
every morning they take a crowded subway
18:08
or bus into the city
18:15
rural areas are far away
18:19
from urban areas
18:22
rural areas are quiet
18:25
with many fields
18:29
farmers grow various crops
18:32
and raise farm animals
18:35
there let me interrupt here i
18:38
just want to make a little point you
18:41
grow
18:42
crops grow plants you
18:45
raise animals okay
18:48
don't say grow animals
18:51
that sounds weird and don't say i
18:54
raise corn what you raise corn that
18:58
doesn't make sense
18:59
okay so grow crops
19:02
raise animals okay good
19:05
let's continue usually
19:09
they do not hurry like people
19:12
who live in urban areas
19:17
some people like the peace
19:20
and quiet of rural areas
19:24
better than the crowded noisy life
19:28
of the city that's true which do you
19:32
like better do you like the noisy
19:36
busy crazy life
19:39
in the city or do you like the calm
19:43
quiet peaceful life in the countryside
19:47
interesting question okay
19:53
okay now it's time for the reading skill
19:55
and the reading skill here
19:57
is to classify now do you remember from
20:00
the previous unit
20:01
i said to classify is to put
20:04
a nouns or things
20:08
ideas into different groups you classify
20:12
into different groups sometimes we can
20:14
say categories a category
20:17
is a group things that belong together
20:20
that's one group right then another
20:22
group and maybe another group here we
20:24
have
20:24
three different groups and they are all
20:27
areas different types of areas now
20:30
remember
20:31
it's going to be easy because we talked
20:33
about three different areas
20:35
we talked about an urban area or
20:38
city we talked about suburb suburbs or
20:42
suburban area did you see that in the
20:44
reading
20:45
and also a rural rural
20:49
area in the countryside so those are our
20:51
three areas
20:52
and then we have a clue on the other
20:54
side you know we see
20:56
the adjectives how do we describe them
20:58
so let's fill in the blanks
21:00
first of all we have the first section a
21:03
beep area
21:04
we don't know yet because we have to
21:06
read the clue
21:07
on the other side that the line goes to
21:10
the box that says
21:11
noisy many cars and
21:14
tall peep okay so
21:18
what uh first of all we can do b first
21:21
right let's do b first
21:22
so we have noisy many cars and tall
21:26
tall what remember skyscrapers what's
21:29
another word for
21:30
skyscrapers see if i can write this well
21:32
of course you know it it's actually
21:34
two words it's office
21:39
office building
21:45
okay okay office buildings noisy many
21:48
cars and tall
21:49
office buildings i put an s on there
21:51
because there are
21:52
more than one building there's many
21:53
buildings in the city
21:55
so obviously that's the area it's a city
21:58
we call it
21:59
an urban area urban
22:02
remember pronunciation urban
22:05
okay my handwriting is uh not so neat
22:08
with the pen but that's okay
22:10
okay next we have the next area
22:14
for c beep area what is the clue
22:17
what's the clue what's the how do we
22:19
describe it we say it's
22:20
quieter than urban areas that's our only
22:24
clue
22:25
but obviously if it's quieter than urban
22:28
areas
22:28
well we could either say it's either the
22:31
suburbs
22:32
or it's a rural area but before so
22:35
we have two choices right both are
22:37
quieter than urban areas
22:38
but what's what's uh what's d right
22:41
let's what's the clue for d
22:42
it says beep from urban areas many
22:45
fields ah okay
22:46
so many fields if there are many fields
22:50
farmers probably grow their crops or
22:52
raise animals in those
22:54
fields then we know that's a rural area
22:57
so we can do that here
22:58
we can put rural and that means
23:01
right before we had the choice quieter
23:03
than urban areas
23:04
rural areas and suburbs
23:08
right so but remember the adjective
23:11
for uh suburbs suburb is a noun
23:15
suburban we saw that in the text right
23:18
suburban is the adjective and area is a
23:21
noun
23:22
so we have to write suburban subur
23:25
[Music]
23:27
ben suburban so we have to add
23:30
a n here to make an adjective suburban
23:34
area okay so suburban area is quieter
23:38
than urban areas yes
23:39
rural area beep from urban areas many
23:42
fields
23:43
so in the reading passage remember what
23:45
it said about
23:46
rural areas right suburban areas are
23:48
near
23:49
urban areas they're close too because
23:51
you know people in the city who work in
23:53
the city they don't want to go very far
23:54
back and forth but in the rural area
23:57
they don't care they're not going to the
23:59
city
23:59
they in fact many people in the rural
24:01
area they don't want to be near the city
24:04
they want to be far away
24:07
from urban areas and that's our answer
24:09
so far
24:11
away from
24:14
actually these three words are a good
24:18
um our common uh
24:21
group uh collection of words far away
24:25
from
24:25
remember that far away from don't just
24:28
learn far
24:29
by itself far away but you know that's
24:32
far away it's okay but far away from
24:34
something else that's a good um group
24:38
to remember when you're studying english
24:40
right
24:41
far away from far away from what are you
24:44
far away from
24:44
i am far away from the city i am far
24:48
away from
24:49
my school okay so far away from some
24:52
things a good
24:53
uh group to remember together those
24:56
words okay so
24:57
very good well that is our lesson today
25:00
we talked about different types of
25:02
areas different types of communities oh
25:05
how to describe
25:06
those different types of communities and
25:08
we found that there were three different
25:10
types of communities and we know now
25:11
how to describe them so what kind of
25:14
community
25:15
do you like the best do you like to live
25:18
in an urban area
25:19
do you like to live in the suburbs or do
25:22
you like to live in the countryside
25:24
or rural area where do you want to live
25:27
when you grow up
25:28
it's a good thing to think about okay so
25:30
anyway that's our lesson today
25:32
thank you for studying with me as always
25:34
and we'll see you in the next lesson
25:36
take care bye bye
25:45
you
