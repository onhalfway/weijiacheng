hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading i'm brian stewart and
in this lesson we're going over
social studies book four lesson four
local governments and in this lesson
you will discover what local governments
do
and what different types of government
leaders
there are so let's begin
let's start with the vocabulary as usual
the first
word or phrase is actually two words is
local government i mentioned that in the
introduction to this lesson
local government when we think about
government there are different types of
government
local government is a government that
controls
a county a city
or town but not a country
so a local government is a smaller
government it might
control like they said a county a city
or a town
a town is smaller than a city
or a county a
county is a subdivision in america
county is a subdivision of a
state right so let's take the example of
california california is one state but
there are many
many counties smaller areas in
california
that might that have their own local
governments right
of course you have the national
government that
oversees all the states then each state
has their own
state government and then each county
might have their own government as well
now of course you have a town or a city
that's a large group of people they need
their own government
for that town or city so
government can get very complicated
different types
of government but local government is a
small government for
a small specific area
next we have tax
taxes i hope you don't have to worry
about taxes but when you get older
yeah everybody worries about taxes okay
so money tax is money that the
government collects
from you and there they're different
types of taxes when you go to the store
and buy something
now not in korea you don't really it's
not apparent it might be hidden
but in america for example they'll have
what we call a
sales tax so let's say you go to the
store
and you buy an ice cream cone and the
ice cream cone is
one dollar so do you pay one dollar
no you may pay one dollar and seven
cents because the extra seven cents
is the sales tax on the ice cream
it doesn't matter what you buy whether
it's ice cream
glue gas for your car taxes are added
into that so
sales tax there's um income
tax when you earn money you have to pay
taxes a portion of the money that you
earn
you have to pay that to local or
national
government as part of taxes and that's
how the governments get the money
that they need to do this to perform the
services that they do
for the citizens so the government
collects money from you
but of course the government needs money
in order to operate
budget so you have to be careful with
money
right and you need to make a
plan for spending budget
really is a plan for spending money
a plan for spending
i'll just put spending because obviously
money spending a plan for spending
so it's also the amount of money that is
needed for a purpose
yeah you could say um i will uh
if your parents want to buy something
let's say
your family wants to buy a new car your
parents might say
we don't have the budget for that
or if our budget will not cover that
in other words they cannot make a
proper plan to spend that amount of
money because they don't have enough
money but be careful budget is not
money budget is a plan to spend
money so it's also can be used the
amount of money that is needed for a
purpose
so you could say a new car will not fit
into our budget it
it won't it's not correct according to
our plan
okay so budget be careful spending your
money make
a good budget okay city council
now we talked about different types of
government we talked about local
governments
now and remember local governments can
govern a certain area we talked about
town city
county and state could be local
government too
but if you're talking just about a city
city
council that is the government that
governs a whole city and it's a
council a council means there are it is
a group of people
right a council is several people
usually five
could be seven eight nine uh depends on
the size of the city
and how the city manages its affairs
and usually the council members they
might be in charge of different
departments like
one council member is in charge of
making sure the roads
are clean and safe another council
member might be
in charge of water or other uh
services that you get at your home so it
depends
you know on the on the type of the city
and many different cities have different
types of councils so they're all
different
it's very hard to to to give you an
example of just one city council
but it's a city government which makes
and passes
laws now it's important to realize that
of course these laws are
just for that city and they do not
contradict state or federal law right
they don't make laws about
crimes like murder or burglary those are
state
and federal laws but they do make laws
about when will garbage be collected
if you throw garbage on the street
what is the punishment for that you know
you can't just throw garbage on the
street
what about parking they will make laws
about parking garbage collection
utilities
electricity and water usage so they make
laws
that are very specific and concern local
issues okay but big issues like murder
crime robbery
murder crime murder robbery other
types of crime those are usually state
or
federal laws okay
lawmaker of course who makes the laws
very easy
law maker it's one word but a lawmaker
is a person
who makes law and there are many
different levels like we just saw
the city council those people will make
laws on
a local level here we have a picture and
you notice the picture is the united
states senate
so this man is a member of congress
senate and house of representatives
and all those people what do they do
they make laws on a national level
they are also called lawmakers so
whether a person makes the laws
at the national level the state level or
the
local city or county level they are all
law makers they all make laws and of
course a democratic society
like america and many other countries
around the world
laws are the key to having a successful
democracy
everybody must follow or obey
the laws and people need to make the
laws and sometimes the laws are changed
for different situations so being a
lawmaker
is a very important position a very
important
very responsible position to have in a
democratic society
okay constitution now i heard that
sometimes people have difficulty
pronouncing this and it's not really the
words it's just
putting it all together is it easy to
say this word
constitution when you have a large word
like this
it's easy to think about it in different
parts
there are four different parts syllables
or korean right
okay sorry so but four syllables
in constitution what are they con
to shun so if you're having difficulty
pronouncing a large word like this
with usually three or more syllables
syllable i'll spell that for you and
remember syllable is like um
sil makes i can't talk and write at the
same time yeah that's right syllable
syllable syllable is like um it's like
you break
the word into different syllables so we
say
and then just put those words together a
little bit more quickly each time
constitution
constitution constitution constitution
constitution so it's constitution okay
and constitution is basically a set of
basic
laws for a country so each democratic
country
in the world will have a constitution
and a constitution just sets what are
the basic laws
right what are and they usually
tell you what are your rights you know
you
in in america the constitution gives
people
the right to freely assemble meet
and gather it gives them the right to
say whatever they want
as long as they don't harm anybody this
is a little complicated there but you
have freedom of speech
in america you have the freedom to have
a gun to
own a gun so these are all rights that
are given to you
in the constitution they are laws that
are
granted to the citizens of a country
okay that's a constitution
next we have judge so we talked about
lawmakers before people who make
laws but again people have to follow the
laws so what happens when people
don't follow the laws well then they go
to court
and they must face a judge and a judge
is a person in court
in a court a court of law who decides
how the law should be applied so if
someone
breaks the law well first of all we have
to decide did they really break the law
or not
in some cases they're like that and the
judge will say oh he didn't break the
law
he acted within the law there was
there's no case
so sometimes that happens but sometimes
more more often people obviously break
the law there's no question about that
so the judge has to decide what how
what will their what will the
consequence of that be
what will happen to that person because
they broke the law will they have to pay
money
or will they go to jail so how do you
apply the law
in that case next we have
suggest if you have an idea and you want
to
uh give that idea to another person you
say oh i have a good idea i think you
should do this
then you are suggesting your idea you
are
introducing your idea or maybe you have
a more formal idea we call it a plan
and you've written it down so you have a
plan
and you want to introduce this and
say hey this is a good thing to do we
should do this
then you are suggesting something you're
suggesting
for example a course of action so
it could be very simple i suggest we go
to the beach this weekend
that's an idea right if it's hot and
sunny outside
why not that's a good suggestion okay
suggest
suggestion okay next we have punishment
remember i just talked about judge and
the judge really decides
what punishment should be made for
someone who breaks the law
a punishment is a penalty penalty
is a consequence a negative consequence
for doing something wrong if you do
something wrong
your mom might spank you now this is
interesting picture i had some
discussion with a co-worker
and we were discussing whether it was
legal or not
to for parents to spank what she
she what is she doing this action it's a
verb
spank is it legal to spank your child
and it's interesting i didn't know this
but i looked up on the internet
in europe in many european countries
it's illegal for parents to spank their
children
in america it's legal parents do have
the right to spank their children
but they cannot cause harm or
injury to that child of course not that
would be terrible
but you know it's kind of an interesting
thing when i was young nobody thought
about that i got spanked when i was a
bad boy
right so you know it depends you know on
on
the degree and the the extent of it but
it is a type of
punishment it's a negative
consequence to doing something wrong if
you're caught doing something wrong
you will receive a penalty or a
punishment and again like i said that
could be a fine maybe the judge makes
you pay
money or the judge says you need to go
to jail
those are also types of punishments
okay good those are the vocabulary words
for this lesson
okay let's go over the two main ideas
for this lesson the first main idea is
what do
local governments do right we're talking
about local governments
but what do they do they do many
different things
first of all and last of all they
collect
taxes okay so again all governments
collect taxes citizens have to
pay taxes and they go the taxes not the
citizens
okay they refers to the taxes the money
they the taxes go into the government
budget
not citizens strange okay
so citizens have to pay taxes the taxes
go
into the government budget and the
government can make a large budget or a
small budget
depending on how much money they receive
in taxes
so they might have a big budget in other
words they have a big plan and they have
a lot of money to spend
in in the budget or they might have a
small budget if there's not many people
living in the area
they don't collect many taxes so they
might have a small budget a small plan
to spend money now governments also
make laws local governments make laws
the members of the city council decide
what
rules citizens should follow so for so
for example
how fast can you drive your car near a
school
uh is it legal to ride bikes in this
area
can you ride your skateboard in this
area can you ride a motorcycle
in this area so those you know local
laws
local issues not big issues like big
crimes
but local issues and also you know water
water services electrical services
garbage clean up services these are all
regulated by the city council
now why do local governments do this
the main purpose of local governments or
any government of course
is to keep citizens safe
so local governments will oversee police
departments fire departments
and other public services to make sure
that everybody is safe
and we have the services that we need to
live a happy and productive life
so laws help keep
the community safe keep someone
safe all local laws of course must
follow the constitution
and that's kind of what i was talking
about earlier the local government will
make
laws but those laws are not cannot
contradict
the bigger laws of the state or of
course the nation
if a local government makes a law that
contradicts or goes against the national
constitution
that law will be canceled by a judge
judges say no you can't do that that is
unconstitutional
[Music]
oh now that's a really long word isn't
it we have an
unconstitutional unconstitutional sorry
mitis
unconstitutional so if something is
unconstitutional
it is a law that is passed that violates
or goes against
the national constitution and that local
law
will be deleted it will be erased
it will be struck down by a judge
and it won't be a la uh
a proper law it'll go away okay so but
local governments
obviously should make laws that keep
citizens safe
okay next we have government leaders
what types of government leaders are
there and again i've been talking about
different types of government small
government local government
state government national government
that's what we see here
so what is an example of a leader in a
local government
we already talked about city council
right that's a group of people
who decide on certain matters but
usually in most cities they also have a
mayor and a mayor he's kind of like the
president
of your town or your city
or he or she of course and they are
they kind of have executive power over
the city council
sometimes you know of course they need
the support of the city council
and they work with the city council but
they also make decisions
on their own and they kind of steer or
guide
the policies of the city or the town
this actually is a picture of a very
famous mayor i believe that's mike
bloomberg
he's the famous mayor of new york city
so of course really big cities and
famous cities
the mayor is very uh popular and maybe
everybody in that country knows about
that mayor and so the mayor of
new york chicago los angeles usually
they can become very
uh nationally recognized figures or
leaders
smaller towns no they're just known in
that smaller town
but anyway it's an important position to
have in a local community
that's in the local government now the
state government level
of course we have the governor of the
state and the governor again
he's like he or she is like the
president
of the whole state now this is a picture
of a young
arnold schwarzenegger i don't know maybe
you're too young but arnold
schwarzenegger
became famous as an action movie star
in america and before that he was a
bodybuilder and before that
he wasn't american he immigrated from
austria
and he became the governor of california
so again america is a kind of an
interesting nation that an
immigrant somebody who grows up in
another country can move to america
and become a a governor of a state they
can't become the president of the united
states they have to be
born in the united states but they can
become a governor and that's
that's what arnold schwarzenegger did he
became the governor of
california and it's kind of like being
the president of a state
that is the na the state leader
uh they uh decide policy and they
shape laws for the entire state
okay on the national government we have
president
of a country now of course you know the
president the president he or she
is the leader of the entire country and
of course this is a picture
of obama barack obama who was the first
black uh president of america from 2008
to 2016. so he's the president of a
country
and the president of a country of course
sets the direction
for the policies and the laws that are
decided for a country so you have
different
levels so it's like presidential level
in each each area so a mayor is like the
president of a city
the governor is like the president of a
state and the president of course is the
president
of the nation okay good so these are
different types of government leaders
okay now it's time to go over the
reading so as usual
i will read it out loud practice with me
concentrate on the pronunciation of the
different words
and of course focus on the key
vocabulary
from the lesson are you guys ready let's
begin
in every community the local government
works to improve the lives
of its community members
citizens have to pay taxes
to keep their government working
taxes in a community go into
the government budget
and are used to make the community
better in
a city or town the members
of the city council act as
lawmakers they decide
what kinds of rules citizens
should follow
all local laws must follow
the constitution the constitution
is the most important law in a country
judges in the law courts have a
very important job they work hard
to keep the community safe
a judge has the power to decide
if laws are fair and suggest
law changes
the laws are made to keep the citizens
safe and happy if people
break them they will get a punishment
if people break them they will be
punished okay or they get a punishment
okay okay so how is this reading passage
organized in this case it has a main
idea
and then details to support that main
idea so
what is the main idea for this passage
we have the beep
works to improve the lives of its
community members
so we talked about different types of
government right we said there's a
national government a state government
and a city or county government and when
we talk about the small
types of governments it's a local area
so we could say the local government the
local government
works to improve local oops el
govern now
government is interesting i always
misspell it
because the r is like a little bit
silent people say
government well r is not silent
government
but the n is silent the n is silent so i
always get confused with the r
n or i used to but just think of it this
way govern
meant don't pronounce it like that it's
government
government it's like the n is silent we
don't really pronounce the
n so it's government government
um but it is our n okay so government
well i'm over pronouncing government
okay government
okay so the local government works to
improve the lives of its community
members
citizens have to pay what to keep the
government working well of course every
everybody in a country needs to have
something
in order to keep working and that is
money but what how do how do governments
get money
they get money through taxes so citizens
have to pay
taxes to keep their government working
in tax
x after x we put es for plural
taxes so have to pay taxes
to keep their government working okay
so the members of the beep decide
what kinds of rules citizens should
follow the members of the now you could
use local government again
but what type of local government do we
have in a city or a town
remember we have a group of people who
decide or make
laws in that community and we could call
that
and there's members so there's more than
one there's several members of the what
of the city council of the city
council so it's two words counsel yeah
okay this pen yeah that's right c-o-u
and okay counsel the city council decide
what kinds of rules citizens should
follow if people break the laws they
will get a
or they're trying to trick you and right
but it's a
right they will get a what they won't
get a spanking
they'll get a fine or a prison sentence
and that is a type of
punishment punish
meant
okay so if people break the laws they
will get
a punishment that's fine it does sound a
little bit awkward to me i would
i would say they will be punished that's
enough but it doesn't matter you could
say either way
they will be punished punished
yeah so they will be punished
or they will receive some kind of
penalty
okay so penalty is punishment okay so
people break the laws they will get
a punishment or they will be punished so
don't break the laws obviously
so in this lesson we talked about local
governments and what they do
right they collect taxes they help
people stay
safe and happy and they make laws
and judges enforce the laws of course
judges are part of the local government
as well
it's a interesting lesson to think about
and to read more about to learn more
about your community
and how it works so anyway thanks as
usual for studying with me
and i hope to see you in the next lesson
take care everybody bye-bye
you

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading i'm brian stewart and
00:12
in this lesson we're going over
00:14
social studies book four lesson four
00:17
local governments and in this lesson
00:20
you will discover what local governments
00:23
do
00:24
and what different types of government
00:28
leaders
00:29
there are so let's begin
00:35
let's start with the vocabulary as usual
00:38
the first
00:39
word or phrase is actually two words is
00:42
local government i mentioned that in the
00:44
introduction to this lesson
00:46
local government when we think about
00:49
government there are different types of
00:51
government
00:52
local government is a government that
00:54
controls
00:55
a county a city
00:58
or town but not a country
01:01
so a local government is a smaller
01:04
government it might
01:05
control like they said a county a city
01:07
or a town
01:08
a town is smaller than a city
01:11
or a county a
01:14
county is a subdivision in america
01:16
county is a subdivision of a
01:19
state right so let's take the example of
01:22
california california is one state but
01:25
there are many
01:26
many counties smaller areas in
01:29
california
01:30
that might that have their own local
01:32
governments right
01:33
of course you have the national
01:35
government that
01:37
oversees all the states then each state
01:40
has their own
01:41
state government and then each county
01:44
might have their own government as well
01:46
now of course you have a town or a city
01:48
that's a large group of people they need
01:51
their own government
01:52
for that town or city so
01:55
government can get very complicated
01:57
different types
01:58
of government but local government is a
02:00
small government for
02:01
a small specific area
02:06
next we have tax
02:09
taxes i hope you don't have to worry
02:11
about taxes but when you get older
02:13
yeah everybody worries about taxes okay
02:16
so money tax is money that the
02:18
government collects
02:20
from you and there they're different
02:21
types of taxes when you go to the store
02:24
and buy something
02:25
now not in korea you don't really it's
02:28
not apparent it might be hidden
02:30
but in america for example they'll have
02:32
what we call a
02:33
sales tax so let's say you go to the
02:36
store
02:36
and you buy an ice cream cone and the
02:39
ice cream cone is
02:40
one dollar so do you pay one dollar
02:43
no you may pay one dollar and seven
02:46
cents because the extra seven cents
02:49
is the sales tax on the ice cream
02:53
it doesn't matter what you buy whether
02:54
it's ice cream
02:56
glue gas for your car taxes are added
03:00
into that so
03:01
sales tax there's um income
03:04
tax when you earn money you have to pay
03:06
taxes a portion of the money that you
03:08
earn
03:09
you have to pay that to local or
03:11
national
03:13
government as part of taxes and that's
03:15
how the governments get the money
03:17
that they need to do this to perform the
03:20
services that they do
03:21
for the citizens so the government
03:23
collects money from you
03:24
but of course the government needs money
03:26
in order to operate
03:30
budget so you have to be careful with
03:33
money
03:33
right and you need to make a
03:36
plan for spending budget
03:40
really is a plan for spending money
03:43
a plan for spending
03:47
i'll just put spending because obviously
03:49
money spending a plan for spending
03:51
so it's also the amount of money that is
03:53
needed for a purpose
03:55
yeah you could say um i will uh
03:59
if your parents want to buy something
04:02
let's say
04:02
your family wants to buy a new car your
04:04
parents might say
04:05
we don't have the budget for that
04:08
or if our budget will not cover that
04:12
in other words they cannot make a
04:16
proper plan to spend that amount of
04:18
money because they don't have enough
04:19
money but be careful budget is not
04:21
money budget is a plan to spend
04:25
money so it's also can be used the
04:27
amount of money that is needed for a
04:29
purpose
04:30
so you could say a new car will not fit
04:33
into our budget it
04:34
it won't it's not correct according to
04:37
our plan
04:38
okay so budget be careful spending your
04:41
money make
04:42
a good budget okay city council
04:45
now we talked about different types of
04:47
government we talked about local
04:49
governments
04:49
now and remember local governments can
04:53
govern a certain area we talked about
04:55
town city
04:57
county and state could be local
04:59
government too
05:00
but if you're talking just about a city
05:02
city
05:03
council that is the government that
05:07
governs a whole city and it's a
05:10
council a council means there are it is
05:13
a group of people
05:14
right a council is several people
05:17
usually five
05:18
could be seven eight nine uh depends on
05:21
the size of the city
05:22
and how the city manages its affairs
05:26
and usually the council members they
05:28
might be in charge of different
05:29
departments like
05:30
one council member is in charge of
05:33
making sure the roads
05:34
are clean and safe another council
05:36
member might be
05:38
in charge of water or other uh
05:41
services that you get at your home so it
05:43
depends
05:44
you know on the on the type of the city
05:46
and many different cities have different
05:48
types of councils so they're all
05:49
different
05:50
it's very hard to to to give you an
05:52
example of just one city council
05:54
but it's a city government which makes
05:56
and passes
05:57
laws now it's important to realize that
05:59
of course these laws are
06:00
just for that city and they do not
06:04
contradict state or federal law right
06:08
they don't make laws about
06:09
crimes like murder or burglary those are
06:12
state
06:12
and federal laws but they do make laws
06:16
about when will garbage be collected
06:20
if you throw garbage on the street
06:24
what is the punishment for that you know
06:26
you can't just throw garbage on the
06:27
street
06:27
what about parking they will make laws
06:30
about parking garbage collection
06:31
utilities
06:33
electricity and water usage so they make
06:36
laws
06:36
that are very specific and concern local
06:40
issues okay but big issues like murder
06:43
crime robbery
06:44
murder crime murder robbery other
06:48
types of crime those are usually state
06:50
or
06:51
federal laws okay
06:54
lawmaker of course who makes the laws
06:57
very easy
06:58
law maker it's one word but a lawmaker
07:01
is a person
07:02
who makes law and there are many
07:05
different levels like we just saw
07:06
the city council those people will make
07:09
laws on
07:10
a local level here we have a picture and
07:12
you notice the picture is the united
07:13
states senate
07:14
so this man is a member of congress
07:17
senate and house of representatives
07:20
and all those people what do they do
07:22
they make laws on a national level
07:24
they are also called lawmakers so
07:27
whether a person makes the laws
07:29
at the national level the state level or
07:32
the
07:32
local city or county level they are all
07:36
law makers they all make laws and of
07:39
course a democratic society
07:41
like america and many other countries
07:43
around the world
07:45
laws are the key to having a successful
07:49
democracy
07:50
everybody must follow or obey
07:53
the laws and people need to make the
07:55
laws and sometimes the laws are changed
07:58
for different situations so being a
08:00
lawmaker
08:01
is a very important position a very
08:04
important
08:05
very responsible position to have in a
08:07
democratic society
08:10
okay constitution now i heard that
08:14
sometimes people have difficulty
08:16
pronouncing this and it's not really the
08:18
words it's just
08:18
putting it all together is it easy to
08:21
say this word
08:23
constitution when you have a large word
08:26
like this
08:27
it's easy to think about it in different
08:30
parts
08:31
there are four different parts syllables
08:34
or korean right
08:37
okay sorry so but four syllables
08:41
in constitution what are they con
08:45
to shun so if you're having difficulty
08:49
pronouncing a large word like this
08:51
with usually three or more syllables
08:55
syllable i'll spell that for you and
08:57
remember syllable is like um
09:00
sil makes i can't talk and write at the
09:02
same time yeah that's right syllable
09:04
syllable syllable is like um it's like
09:07
you break
09:08
the word into different syllables so we
09:11
say
09:17
and then just put those words together a
09:19
little bit more quickly each time
09:22
constitution
09:24
constitution constitution constitution
09:27
constitution so it's constitution okay
09:31
and constitution is basically a set of
09:33
basic
09:34
laws for a country so each democratic
09:37
country
09:38
in the world will have a constitution
09:41
and a constitution just sets what are
09:44
the basic laws
09:45
right what are and they usually
09:49
tell you what are your rights you know
09:52
you
09:52
in in america the constitution gives
09:55
people
09:55
the right to freely assemble meet
09:58
and gather it gives them the right to
10:01
say whatever they want
10:02
as long as they don't harm anybody this
10:05
is a little complicated there but you
10:06
have freedom of speech
10:08
in america you have the freedom to have
10:10
a gun to
10:11
own a gun so these are all rights that
10:14
are given to you
10:15
in the constitution they are laws that
10:17
are
10:18
granted to the citizens of a country
10:21
okay that's a constitution
10:24
next we have judge so we talked about
10:26
lawmakers before people who make
10:28
laws but again people have to follow the
10:31
laws so what happens when people
10:33
don't follow the laws well then they go
10:36
to court
10:37
and they must face a judge and a judge
10:41
is a person in court
10:42
in a court a court of law who decides
10:47
how the law should be applied so if
10:50
someone
10:51
breaks the law well first of all we have
10:53
to decide did they really break the law
10:55
or not
10:56
in some cases they're like that and the
10:58
judge will say oh he didn't break the
10:59
law
11:00
he acted within the law there was
11:02
there's no case
11:03
so sometimes that happens but sometimes
11:06
more more often people obviously break
11:08
the law there's no question about that
11:10
so the judge has to decide what how
11:14
what will their what will the
11:15
consequence of that be
11:17
what will happen to that person because
11:19
they broke the law will they have to pay
11:21
money
11:22
or will they go to jail so how do you
11:24
apply the law
11:25
in that case next we have
11:29
suggest if you have an idea and you want
11:32
to
11:33
uh give that idea to another person you
11:35
say oh i have a good idea i think you
11:36
should do this
11:37
then you are suggesting your idea you
11:40
are
11:41
introducing your idea or maybe you have
11:44
a more formal idea we call it a plan
11:46
and you've written it down so you have a
11:49
plan
11:50
and you want to introduce this and
11:53
say hey this is a good thing to do we
11:55
should do this
11:56
then you are suggesting something you're
11:59
suggesting
11:59
for example a course of action so
12:03
it could be very simple i suggest we go
12:05
to the beach this weekend
12:07
that's an idea right if it's hot and
12:09
sunny outside
12:10
why not that's a good suggestion okay
12:13
suggest
12:14
suggestion okay next we have punishment
12:18
remember i just talked about judge and
12:20
the judge really decides
12:22
what punishment should be made for
12:24
someone who breaks the law
12:26
a punishment is a penalty penalty
12:29
is a consequence a negative consequence
12:33
for doing something wrong if you do
12:35
something wrong
12:36
your mom might spank you now this is
12:39
interesting picture i had some
12:41
discussion with a co-worker
12:42
and we were discussing whether it was
12:44
legal or not
12:46
to for parents to spank what she
12:49
she what is she doing this action it's a
12:51
verb
12:52
spank is it legal to spank your child
12:55
and it's interesting i didn't know this
12:58
but i looked up on the internet
12:59
in europe in many european countries
13:01
it's illegal for parents to spank their
13:03
children
13:04
in america it's legal parents do have
13:07
the right to spank their children
13:09
but they cannot cause harm or
13:12
injury to that child of course not that
13:14
would be terrible
13:15
but you know it's kind of an interesting
13:17
thing when i was young nobody thought
13:19
about that i got spanked when i was a
13:20
bad boy
13:21
right so you know it depends you know on
13:24
on
13:25
the degree and the the extent of it but
13:28
it is a type of
13:29
punishment it's a negative
13:33
consequence to doing something wrong if
13:35
you're caught doing something wrong
13:37
you will receive a penalty or a
13:40
punishment and again like i said that
13:41
could be a fine maybe the judge makes
13:43
you pay
13:44
money or the judge says you need to go
13:46
to jail
13:47
those are also types of punishments
13:50
okay good those are the vocabulary words
13:53
for this lesson
13:57
okay let's go over the two main ideas
13:59
for this lesson the first main idea is
14:01
what do
14:02
local governments do right we're talking
14:04
about local governments
14:06
but what do they do they do many
14:08
different things
14:09
first of all and last of all they
14:12
collect
14:13
taxes okay so again all governments
14:16
collect taxes citizens have to
14:20
pay taxes and they go the taxes not the
14:24
citizens
14:25
okay they refers to the taxes the money
14:29
they the taxes go into the government
14:31
budget
14:32
not citizens strange okay
14:35
so citizens have to pay taxes the taxes
14:38
go
14:38
into the government budget and the
14:41
government can make a large budget or a
14:43
small budget
14:44
depending on how much money they receive
14:47
in taxes
14:48
so they might have a big budget in other
14:50
words they have a big plan and they have
14:51
a lot of money to spend
14:53
in in the budget or they might have a
14:55
small budget if there's not many people
14:57
living in the area
14:58
they don't collect many taxes so they
15:00
might have a small budget a small plan
15:02
to spend money now governments also
15:06
make laws local governments make laws
15:09
the members of the city council decide
15:12
what
15:12
rules citizens should follow so for so
15:15
for example
15:16
how fast can you drive your car near a
15:18
school
15:20
uh is it legal to ride bikes in this
15:23
area
15:23
can you ride your skateboard in this
15:26
area can you ride a motorcycle
15:28
in this area so those you know local
15:31
laws
15:32
local issues not big issues like big
15:35
crimes
15:35
but local issues and also you know water
15:39
water services electrical services
15:42
garbage clean up services these are all
15:45
regulated by the city council
15:48
now why do local governments do this
15:51
the main purpose of local governments or
15:54
any government of course
15:55
is to keep citizens safe
15:58
so local governments will oversee police
16:00
departments fire departments
16:03
and other public services to make sure
16:05
that everybody is safe
16:07
and we have the services that we need to
16:10
live a happy and productive life
16:12
so laws help keep
16:15
the community safe keep someone
16:18
safe all local laws of course must
16:22
follow the constitution
16:23
and that's kind of what i was talking
16:24
about earlier the local government will
16:27
make
16:27
laws but those laws are not cannot
16:30
contradict
16:32
the bigger laws of the state or of
16:33
course the nation
16:35
if a local government makes a law that
16:38
contradicts or goes against the national
16:42
constitution
16:43
that law will be canceled by a judge
16:46
judges say no you can't do that that is
16:49
unconstitutional
16:53
[Music]
16:58
oh now that's a really long word isn't
17:00
it we have an
17:06
unconstitutional unconstitutional sorry
17:09
mitis
17:10
unconstitutional so if something is
17:13
unconstitutional
17:14
it is a law that is passed that violates
17:17
or goes against
17:19
the national constitution and that local
17:22
law
17:22
will be deleted it will be erased
17:26
it will be struck down by a judge
17:29
and it won't be a la uh
17:32
a proper law it'll go away okay so but
17:35
local governments
17:37
obviously should make laws that keep
17:39
citizens safe
17:40
okay next we have government leaders
17:44
what types of government leaders are
17:46
there and again i've been talking about
17:48
different types of government small
17:50
government local government
17:52
state government national government
17:54
that's what we see here
17:55
so what is an example of a leader in a
17:58
local government
17:59
we already talked about city council
18:01
right that's a group of people
18:04
who decide on certain matters but
18:06
usually in most cities they also have a
18:08
mayor and a mayor he's kind of like the
18:11
president
18:12
of your town or your city
18:15
or he or she of course and they are
18:19
they kind of have executive power over
18:22
the city council
18:24
sometimes you know of course they need
18:26
the support of the city council
18:28
and they work with the city council but
18:30
they also make decisions
18:31
on their own and they kind of steer or
18:34
guide
18:35
the policies of the city or the town
18:38
this actually is a picture of a very
18:40
famous mayor i believe that's mike
18:42
bloomberg
18:43
he's the famous mayor of new york city
18:45
so of course really big cities and
18:47
famous cities
18:48
the mayor is very uh popular and maybe
18:52
everybody in that country knows about
18:53
that mayor and so the mayor of
18:56
new york chicago los angeles usually
18:58
they can become very
18:59
uh nationally recognized figures or
19:03
leaders
19:04
smaller towns no they're just known in
19:08
that smaller town
19:09
but anyway it's an important position to
19:10
have in a local community
19:12
that's in the local government now the
19:15
state government level
19:16
of course we have the governor of the
19:18
state and the governor again
19:20
he's like he or she is like the
19:22
president
19:23
of the whole state now this is a picture
19:25
of a young
19:26
arnold schwarzenegger i don't know maybe
19:28
you're too young but arnold
19:30
schwarzenegger
19:31
became famous as an action movie star
19:34
in america and before that he was a
19:36
bodybuilder and before that
19:38
he wasn't american he immigrated from
19:41
austria
19:42
and he became the governor of california
19:46
so again america is a kind of an
19:47
interesting nation that an
19:49
immigrant somebody who grows up in
19:51
another country can move to america
19:54
and become a a governor of a state they
19:57
can't become the president of the united
20:00
states they have to be
20:01
born in the united states but they can
20:03
become a governor and that's
20:04
that's what arnold schwarzenegger did he
20:06
became the governor of
20:07
california and it's kind of like being
20:10
the president of a state
20:11
that is the na the state leader
20:14
uh they uh decide policy and they
20:18
shape laws for the entire state
20:21
okay on the national government we have
20:24
president
20:24
of a country now of course you know the
20:26
president the president he or she
20:28
is the leader of the entire country and
20:30
of course this is a picture
20:31
of obama barack obama who was the first
20:34
black uh president of america from 2008
20:38
to 2016. so he's the president of a
20:42
country
20:43
and the president of a country of course
20:45
sets the direction
20:46
for the policies and the laws that are
20:49
decided for a country so you have
20:51
different
20:51
levels so it's like presidential level
20:55
in each each area so a mayor is like the
20:59
president of a city
21:00
the governor is like the president of a
21:02
state and the president of course is the
21:03
president
21:04
of the nation okay good so these are
21:07
different types of government leaders
21:10
okay now it's time to go over the
21:12
reading so as usual
21:14
i will read it out loud practice with me
21:16
concentrate on the pronunciation of the
21:19
different words
21:20
and of course focus on the key
21:22
vocabulary
21:23
from the lesson are you guys ready let's
21:26
begin
21:27
in every community the local government
21:32
works to improve the lives
21:35
of its community members
21:40
citizens have to pay taxes
21:43
to keep their government working
21:48
taxes in a community go into
21:51
the government budget
21:55
and are used to make the community
21:59
better in
22:02
a city or town the members
22:05
of the city council act as
22:09
lawmakers they decide
22:12
what kinds of rules citizens
22:15
should follow
22:19
all local laws must follow
22:22
the constitution the constitution
22:26
is the most important law in a country
22:32
judges in the law courts have a
22:36
very important job they work hard
22:40
to keep the community safe
22:43
a judge has the power to decide
22:47
if laws are fair and suggest
22:51
law changes
22:55
the laws are made to keep the citizens
22:59
safe and happy if people
23:02
break them they will get a punishment
23:07
if people break them they will be
23:09
punished okay or they get a punishment
23:11
okay okay so how is this reading passage
23:15
organized in this case it has a main
23:19
idea
23:19
and then details to support that main
23:22
idea so
23:23
what is the main idea for this passage
23:25
we have the beep
23:26
works to improve the lives of its
23:29
community members
23:31
so we talked about different types of
23:33
government right we said there's a
23:34
national government a state government
23:37
and a city or county government and when
23:40
we talk about the small
23:41
types of governments it's a local area
23:44
so we could say the local government the
23:48
local government
23:49
works to improve local oops el
23:54
govern now
23:57
government is interesting i always
23:59
misspell it
24:00
because the r is like a little bit
24:02
silent people say
24:03
government well r is not silent
24:06
government
24:07
but the n is silent the n is silent so i
24:09
always get confused with the r
24:11
n or i used to but just think of it this
24:13
way govern
24:15
meant don't pronounce it like that it's
24:17
government
24:18
government it's like the n is silent we
24:20
don't really pronounce the
24:21
n so it's government government
24:24
um but it is our n okay so government
24:28
well i'm over pronouncing government
24:30
okay government
24:32
okay so the local government works to
24:33
improve the lives of its community
24:35
members
24:36
citizens have to pay what to keep the
24:39
government working well of course every
24:41
everybody in a country needs to have
24:44
something
24:44
in order to keep working and that is
24:46
money but what how do how do governments
24:49
get money
24:50
they get money through taxes so citizens
24:52
have to pay
24:54
taxes to keep their government working
24:57
in tax
24:58
x after x we put es for plural
25:01
taxes so have to pay taxes
25:05
to keep their government working okay
25:08
so the members of the beep decide
25:12
what kinds of rules citizens should
25:15
follow the members of the now you could
25:17
use local government again
25:19
but what type of local government do we
25:22
have in a city or a town
25:23
remember we have a group of people who
25:25
decide or make
25:27
laws in that community and we could call
25:30
that
25:30
and there's members so there's more than
25:32
one there's several members of the what
25:35
of the city council of the city
25:39
council so it's two words counsel yeah
25:43
okay this pen yeah that's right c-o-u
25:46
and okay counsel the city council decide
25:49
what kinds of rules citizens should
25:51
follow if people break the laws they
25:53
will get a
25:54
or they're trying to trick you and right
25:56
but it's a
25:57
right they will get a what they won't
26:01
get a spanking
26:03
they'll get a fine or a prison sentence
26:05
and that is a type of
26:06
punishment punish
26:10
meant
26:13
okay so if people break the laws they
26:15
will get
26:16
a punishment that's fine it does sound a
26:20
little bit awkward to me i would
26:21
i would say they will be punished that's
26:24
enough but it doesn't matter you could
26:25
say either way
26:26
they will be punished punished
26:31
yeah so they will be punished
26:34
or they will receive some kind of
26:37
penalty
26:38
okay so penalty is punishment okay so
26:41
people break the laws they will get
26:42
a punishment or they will be punished so
26:45
don't break the laws obviously
26:46
so in this lesson we talked about local
26:49
governments and what they do
26:51
right they collect taxes they help
26:53
people stay
26:54
safe and happy and they make laws
26:58
and judges enforce the laws of course
27:00
judges are part of the local government
27:02
as well
27:02
it's a interesting lesson to think about
27:05
and to read more about to learn more
27:07
about your community
27:08
and how it works so anyway thanks as
27:11
