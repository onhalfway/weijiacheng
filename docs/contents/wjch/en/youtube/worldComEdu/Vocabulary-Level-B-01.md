but you know what really sharks are not
really that dangerous
this is just a funny cartoon do you know
i'm a scuba diver i like to scuba dive
and sharks are afraid of people
if i see a shark he's swimming away so
that's very interesting
but we'll look in this unit we'll see
other
interesting facts about sharks let's
begin with the vocabulary let's start
number one a living being
there are many living things in the
world right
you and i are living beings
dogs are living beings parrots right
cats rabbits lizards
all right we have a lot of different
living beings
what do we call things that live
it's a word that starts with c it's
creature this is a little bit of a
difficult word
let's practice the pronunciation
creature creature
it's two syllables two sounds cree
sure creature okay so creatures
are all living things you and i
are creatures dogs are creatures parrots
are creatures
anything that lives and moves is a
creature
plants aren't creatures usually animals
are creatures
okay let's move on the next one here are
a couple of creatures here right one who
finds and
kills animals one means a creature
a living thing that finds
finds and kills animals
what is it we call it a hunter
now here we see this is a spider a
spider
is a hunter because it finds well
insects find it and it kills those
things
but we are hunters too human beings are
hunters we hunt
especially a long long time ago human
beings had to hunt
for their food so there were many
hunters
in a long time ago people were hunters
okay let's move on the next one is very
surprising and wonderful
wow this little boy has a present he's
opening the present
wow he's really surprised and he's
thinks this thing is wonderful what can
we say
it's amazing amazing
if you find something or you see
something
or you learn new
information that's really surprising
and really wonderful that's amazing
okay so something that's amazing
surprising
and wonderful next one what's happening
here we have a picture
one side of the tree is very green nice
the other side of the tree is dead
right to become different right maybe
it's
becoming different trees of course
change with the seasons what do they do
they
change with the seasons so to become
different
they change so maybe in the summer time
the tree looks green
has a lot of leaves but in the winter
all the leaves are gone
the tree looks like it's dead the tree
changes
with the seasons okay let's move on
number five a small amount of liquid
this little bit of liquid right here
right
what is that that is a drop a
drop of liquid do you know of course
when it rains
right it rains like this and we call
those little pieces of
water falling from the sky we call them
rain drops rain drops because
many little drops are falling from the
sky many drops will get you very wet
right we call those raindrops so a
small amount of liquid is a drop

rows actually some sharks have three
rows
of these things okay what are they of
course we're talking
about teeth teeth okay
be careful right because teeth means
many teeth what if you say
one if you say one you say

so one tooth many
teeth okay that's important to remember
so if you go to bed at night right you

right so some children you guys
lose your teeth right but one tooth at a
time
okay so that's teeth next one is very

your body right
if you go to the hospital the doctor
will take some
of your red liquid inside your body
to find out if you're healthy or not
what do we call that liquid
we call it blood okay like a vampire
we'll say blood
okay sorry but we say blood
bl bull bull blood
blood so we say blood and that's the
liquid
inside your body do you know what blood
does it carries
oxygen throughout your body it helps you
live
blood is very important okay
something that causes fear what is this
a cra
these kids were watching television
suddenly the monster
came out of the television it's causing
fear
something that causes fear is what we

causes
fear it's scary the movie

power
she is strong she is strong
having much power is strong are you
strong
can you do a lot of sports uh if you
play
you run outside you will get strong so
don't study all the time
don't play video games all the time go
outside and play
sometimes and get strong okay
get your power okay next one oh here we
have
the subject of our lesson a large fish
in the sea so a large fish in the sea
with sharp teeth and you can see those
teeth whoa they're right there and right
there right
we saw a picture of this guy before he
was on land for some reason
he had a lot of teeth right what is it
it's a
shark a shark a large fish in the sea
with sharp teeth that's a shark
next one 13 having little
or no light okay this street there's a
lot of lights here but
imagine if you go off on a smaller
street and there's not a lot of lights
right or there's very little light and
it's hard to see
right i can't see very well there's not
enough light
we say it's dark it's dark at night
it's dark outside there's no sun so it's
dark
outside okay
what's this guy doing that looks kind of
strange
maybe he's he's afraid of somebody else
in the office right
and he doesn't want to be seen to go
somewhere
where nobody can see you right i can't
see this guy
he's under the desk maybe you play a
game
with your friends right where you what
do you do
you hide the game that you play with
your friends
is probably called hide and
hide and what hide and seek
yes hide and seek so hide means to go
somewhere where nobody can see you
and seek means to look for that person
so many children hide one child
seeks okay and finds those people maybe
he finds those people
but remember hide is an irregular verb
we change it when we talk about the past
tense right so we say hide then we say
hid hid and then we say
hidden hidden so hide
hid hidden okay that's how the verb
changes
for the past tense okay next one
whoa do you do this can you do this this
is very nice on the summer when it's
really hot
i want to go do this right to move in
the water
like a fish well he's not really moving
like a fish did you see a fish do this
i never saw a fish do that but people
when you do this
right you're moving through the water
fish also do that like this right what
are they doing
swim they are swimming can you
swim okay remember swim is an
irregular verb it changes in the past so
we say
swim swam
swam okay one more time swim
swam swum okay
that's how the verb changes in the past
tense
okay so maybe this summer you will go
swimming
okay i hope so it's cool it's great it
will make you strong
okay next one number 16 not
closed so the door is not closed if it's
not closed
it is of course open open
closed pandero right they are opposites
closed and open are opposites
opposites i think in korean
you say pandero right something that is
opposite
closed and open okay that wraps it up
for our words
let's review those words with some
vocabulary exercises are you ready
these are the words we're going to use
creatures
creatures teeth teeth
appear up here and change
change we're going to take these words
and we're going to complete
each sentence with one of these words so
we have
four sentences we need to complete these
sentences
with one of these words let's take a
look at number one
number one many different beep live
in the ocean many different what
live in the ocean we have creatures
teeth appear change
many different teeth live in the ocean
that's crazy right
before we talked about living things
things that live all things that live we
say they are what
creatures right creatures and if you
think about it
many different creatures live in the
ocean
true we're talking about sharks
in this lesson but there's many kinds of
fish
right it's big fish little fish red fish
black fish there are octopus there are
squid
squid or jingle right but you eat ojingo
right
so squid there's whales so
many different creatures live in the
ocean it's really amazing
okay number two sharks have big and
scary what
if you see a shark most people think oh
sharks they have
a lot of right and they have big and
they could be
scary they are of course we're talking
about
teeth sharks have big and scary teeth
right when people look at sharks one of
the first things they see is the teeth
right okay let's move on to number three
i don't want to swim a shark
might what a shark might what a shark
might suddenly come up
right a shark might appear right
and that's interesting i don't want to
swim a shark might appear
yes when you go to the beach be careful
if the lifeguard says don't swim
because as a shark don't swim but
usually
sharks you don't really have to worry
about them like i said before they'll
swim away from you
a lot of people don't know that when
they're swimming there's sharks in the
water
most sharks don't attack people but you
still have to be careful
make sure you check with the lifeguard
at the beach
before you go swimming four soon it will
be winter
soon it will be winter that means it's
not winter now
maybe it's fall it's still warm but it
will soon get cold
the weather will do what it will
it will go from kind of warm to cold
it will change the weather will
change right from fall to winter it's
really cold in the winter
and then it will change again when it
becomes spring right
so the weather will change when the
seasons change
okay that wraps up our words so we've
learned a lot of words in this unit so
far
now we're going to take a short break
come back and look at a reading passage

04:57
here we have a picture
04:59
one side of the tree is very green nice
05:01
the other side of the tree is dead
05:03
right to become different right maybe
05:06
it's
05:07
becoming different trees of course
05:10
change with the seasons what do they do
05:13
they
05:13
change with the seasons so to become

12:06
tense right so we say hide then we say
12:10
hid hid and then we say
12:13
