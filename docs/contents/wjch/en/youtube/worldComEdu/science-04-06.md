hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
my name is brian stewart and in this
lesson we're going over science book
four
lesson six the earth's structure
so this is a good picture isn't it shows
the earth's structure
very simply but we'll talk about this in
this lesson
you will discover what is inside the
earth and
also what are the different parts of the
earth's
surface so let's get started
okay we always start with vocabulary so
our first
vocabulary is continent
continent continent
is one of the seven land masses of the
earth's
surface there are seven continents
can you name them all of course we have
asia
we have uh australia and it also
includes
um new zealand so we could call it
oceana some people call it oceana
africa europe uh north america
south america and is that seven we've
got asia
oceania africa europe north america
south america we're missing one
where did it go well it's not on our map
it's on the south pole it's called
antarctica right that is another huge
landmass
that is all along the bottom of your map
if you look at your world map
it's not that big of course oh
it's just the the shape of the map okay
but it's a it is a big land mass
on the south pole and those are seven
continents
continents of course are land masses
that's where people live people and
animals and plants
live there layer
now a layer is a thickness of a material
covering a surface so think about your
hand
there is a layer of skin on your hand
and the skin
covers the entire surface of your hand
so skin is a layer it's a thickness and
your skin has certain thickness
of a material that covers the surface so
whatever it is you know there is a layer
of something that covers the surface of
another thing
that is what we call the layer
crust crust is an interesting word okay
now i'm not talking about bread okay if
you bake bread
you have um the the bread gets
baked and it's soft in the middle but it
might be a little bit hard on the
outside it's a little bit browner on the
outside depending on
how you cook your bread if you cook it
too long it gets black but anyway
the brown crust of your bread is the
layer
around your bread but the earth has a
similar idea the earth has a crust as
well and that's the top
layer of the earth's surface it's the
outer part of the earth
that covers the mantle but the crust
is really thick normally we talk about
you know like the crust of bread is very
thin
the layer of my skin over my hand is
very thin but the crust of the earth
is very very thick especially in
relation to
us human beings right but that is the
crust
it is in relation to the rest of the
earth it's kind of thin
and it covers the mantle okay we'll talk
about mantle next
mantle of course is underneath the crust
that's the inner part of the earth
and it covers the core so basically
we're talking about three parts of the
earth right we have the crust here
we have the mantle here and then the
core
is here and of course the next one is
core
core the center part of the earth that's
the middle of the earth
it's very hot nobody has ever been
to the core it's too deep you can't you
can't
dig or drill that far underground nobody
has
ever done it in fact the most drills
that have ever
been done have really just poked little
holes in the crust
it's very difficult to hit to the core
except for certain places on the earth
okay but that is the we have the crust
we have the mantle and we have the core
those are the three main parts on the
inside
of the earth now the next word is
melt if something is very very hot
right you turn it from a solid to a
liquid
now you can turn rocks and
metal that is very hard and usually you
think you know
in the winter it gets very cold but you
can heat it up
so much that it can turn into a liquid
i used to work at a mining company a
gold mining company
and to get the gold from the ground and
to make gold bars they would heat
the ore and they would heat it so much
that the gold would settle on the bottom
and then they could pour it out in into
a bar and when it cooled it was a bar of
gold
it's pretty big and heavy okay so you
can melt
almost anything from a solid to a liquid
depth depth is the distance from the top
to the bottom of something so if you're
thinking this is a good picture right
so you think about the surface is up
here of the ocean
that's the surface what is the depth
that is the distance from the
from the layer of water on the surface
to the bottom
of the uh of the ocean the rock
how deep is that what is the depth we
could also say
how deep is it how deep
so we change the word a little bit how
deep is
it we change the word how deep is it and
that's an adjective right deep um and
that would be
depth is a noun what is the depth
same question the distance from the top
to the bottom
of something so you could say like the
swimming pool is the deep end
oh pandiro the opposite of deep is
shallow shallow so you have the shallow
end of the swimming pool you can stand
up but in the deep end
you cannot stand up because the depth is
more than your height okay
next above above is something that is
directly
over or higher than something now this
is an interesting picture
it shows the old idea of an iceberg
99 90 of the iceberg is below water
10 percent is above water so the part of
the iceberg that is above
the surface of the water we say it's
above and the opposite of that would be
below of course
so above directly over or higher
than something and then of course our
opposite word
is below below means to be
under something or lower than something
of course we're talking in relation to
the surface of the water
so if it's under the surface of the
water it is
below and 90 of the iceberg is below
the surface of the water now if it's in
this area
if it's over the surface of the water it
is above
above and below they are direct
opposites okay so those are our words
for the lesson
let's move on
now one of the main ideas of this lesson
of course is to find out
what is the structure of the earth and
remember we talked
about the earth having three main parts
right
we have the crust and we learn these
words in the vocabulary with the crust
which is the outer layer of the earth
the crust
is here right it's very thin well
actually in this picture
it's thicker okay that's fine this is
the crust
and then we have the mantle that's this
red part here
and then the core the center of the
earth is
the core don't be confused it looks like
it's two parts it's one part here
so the core is the center of the earth
it's very
hot there so these are the three
different parts
of the earth's structure
now what about the earth's surface right
instead of looking inside the earth what
about if we look at just the surface of
the earth well there are many different
parts of the earth's surface and we use
different words to describe
different geological features
the first is an island an island
is a small piece of land with water on
all sides so looks like we're circling
here in the caribbean where it looks
like we're circling
cuba dominican republic
puerto rico those islands that are in
the caribbean of course there are many
different islands
all over the world they're just small
areas of land
that are surrounded by water now of
course continents are also surrounded by
water but we don't really call them
islands because they're so big
they're very big usually an island is
smaller
you can cross the island in a day or you
know in a car
easily you could cross the island in a
car ease very easily it's not a very big
piece of land
okay a continent of course is a very big
piece of land it's each
big piece of land i'm talking about
really big piece of land
a continent is huge it would take
days months years to walk across our
or uh to drive across it would easily
take
days to drive across a continent but it
is surrounded it's also surrounded by
oceans and of course
uh the circle here is on south america
which is a continent you could say well
isn't it an island it's surrounded by
water
no not really because it's so big it is
a continent
okay it's not really surrounded by water
central america is attached to it right
there
anyway okay then we have ocean now ocean
is interesting
did you know that the oceans cover
three-fourths
of the earth so most of the earth
is covered with water and we call these
oceans salt water
and huge oceans of course the circle is
here is in the southern pacific
the pacific ocean is the biggest ocean
on earth and you can't even see all of
it from this map you notice
there's some more of it around the other
side
when you come to asia so the pacific
ocean
is huge and of course there's still the
atlantic ocean that we should talk about
there's the indian ocean
uh there's the arctic oceans so they're
most of the earth's surface is covered
by ocean it's a large deep body of salt
water
right not fresh water it's salty and it
covers three-fourths three-fourths of
the earth
we only live on one-fourth of the earth
human beings
can only live on one fourth on the land
but three-fourths of the earth is
covered with
water the earth is a really big place
okay okay let's do the reading together
and as we do the reading i'll read it
out loud
you guys repeat after me practice on
pronunciation
practice pronunciation don't practice on
pronunciation practice pronunciation
and focus on the words in the vocabulary
are you guys ready
here we go earth is
like a very big solid ball
from its top to its center earth
is about 6 000 kilometers
in depth earth has three layers
the crust the mantle and the core
the crust is about five to seventy
kilometers
in depth and is solid rock people live
on masses of land called continents
there are seven continents they
are part of the crust
below the crust is the mantle
which is made of rock it is about
3 000 kilometers in depth
the mantle is so hot that
some of the rock is liquid so that's
what we're seeing here
if we look at this they're really
talking about this as the mantle
maybe this is the the rock that is
melted and this is the rock
that is solid so maybe two parts of the
mantle
the crust is above the mantle and
floats on it the continents move
very very slowly that's an interesting
idea you don't
think about it land rock rock doesn't
move
but actually it does and this is a you
know that's a whole new lesson that's
continental drift theory
uh which says that the continents you
know
your land your country is moving
it's very slow and you don't notice it
it takes
uh thousands tens of thousands
millions of years to really notice it
but
it is moving and the continents are
moving around
below the mantle is the core it is about
3 000 kilometers in depth
the core is the hottest layer it is made
of metal
some of which has melted it's
so hot in the core that the metal
in the core is melted it's liquid
it's like very it's very very hot now of
course when we experience
liquid rock in nature we call it lava
and that's the material that comes up
out of a volcano right and it comes up
because it's
very hot uh underneath the earth and so
it's very hot this
this so hot that the rock is actually
liquid
right and when it there's pressure boom
it comes spewing up
out of the volcano and this of course is
a volcano
so we call that lava when the rock is
melted but though
but the volcano isn't picking up
material from the core
that's way too deep uh the volcano is
picking up material from the mantle
that's coming up to the surface okay
so how was the ideas how were the ideas
in the reading passage organized
here we have main ideas and then we have
details to support
that main idea the main idea is very
simple
earth has three layers well that's very
simple that's very easy to organize
three layers then we can talk about the
crust or the mantle and we can talk
about
we can talk about the crush sorry then
we can talk about the mantle and we can
talk about the core
okay now unfortunately these have been
uh
rearranged a little bit uh so we talk
about the crust first then we talk about
the core
then the mantle really it should be
crust mantle core
to keep it in good organization or at
the top to the bottom but anyway that's
okay
so the crust is beep the mantle excuse
me
the crust is what the mantle remember in
the vocabulary we were talking about
the relationship in terms of location
you know something might be above or
below something else
so we talk about the three layers of the
earth which layer is
on the top which layer is on the outside
we
that of course is the crust and it is
above
the mantle so that's our vocabulary word
it is above
the mantle okay then beep are part of
the crust
and they move slowly so again this is a
point i made during the
um the reading it said it but i also
talked to you about
continental drift theory that is not a
very
old scientific discovery it's only it's
just about a hundred years now uh maybe
a little bit more than
right around 100 years old only a
hundred years old
that a scientist came up with the idea
that
land moves around on the surface of the
earth
that's pretty amazing isn't it for most
of our history we didn't know that
so but what is moving around what are
these big pieces of land that move
slowly across the crust or the surface
of the earth
we call those continents continents
continents there we go continents are
part of the crust
and they move very slowly around the
surface
of the earth now we jump to the deepest
the core is the hottest layer and is
mostly made
of what well if you think about it the
heaviest
part of the earth will of course sink to
the to the very
bottom right to where the the gravity is
right and it is
what what is that what is heavier than
rock well of course metals
are heavier than rock and so the core is
mostly made of metal
however it's not solid metal most of it
is liquid metal it's
so hot there's so much pressure
at the core of the earth that pressure
creates heat
and the heat melts the metal so most of
that metal is liquid
it's like like water but don't touch it
you can't survive in the core of the
earth right
but it moves like water it moves like a
liquid so it's liquid
metal okay the mantle is the layer
in between the crust and the core and it
is so
beep that some of the rock is liquid so
the
now we're talking about rock right just
rock turning into liquid
and of course that's lava when it comes
up to the surface
the mantle is so what hot
the mantle is so hot that some of the
rock is liquid so you don't even have to
get down to the core
to get hot very hot temperatures right
the further
uh the deeper you go in the earth
the hotter it becomes because there's
more and more pressure
uh down there because there's a lot of
weight on top of things
and that pressure creates heat and that
heat will melt rock
and it will melt metal okay
so that's the reading skill that's the
also how the
ideas were organized so it's an
interesting unit i feel like it's a
little bit short but it's very simple
the earth has just three layers right
the crust
the mantle and the core and it's
very interesting to learn about our
world and remember the earth
is huge it's really really big you may
not realize it because you know you just
go to school you walk around your
neighborhood
you walk around your town maybe you take
trips to the countryside
but the earth is so big so i really
encourage you to go out there
travel explore see some of the wonders
of the earth
and think about how many different
parts of the earth there are different
land masses the earth is mostly covered
with
water there's a lot of amazing and
interesting things to discover
and also if we go deep into the earth we
can
we can also discover some more amazing
things
okay so anyway that's our lesson for
today thanks for studying with me
we'll see you in the next one take care
everybody

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading
00:11
my name is brian stewart and in this
00:13
lesson we're going over science book
00:15
four
00:16
lesson six the earth's structure
00:20
so this is a good picture isn't it shows
00:22
the earth's structure
00:23
very simply but we'll talk about this in
00:25
this lesson
00:26
you will discover what is inside the
00:29
earth and
00:30
also what are the different parts of the
00:33
earth's
00:34
surface so let's get started
00:39
okay we always start with vocabulary so
00:42
our first
00:42
vocabulary is continent
00:46
continent continent
00:49
is one of the seven land masses of the
00:52
earth's
00:53
surface there are seven continents
00:56
can you name them all of course we have
00:59
asia
01:00
we have uh australia and it also
01:04
includes
01:04
um new zealand so we could call it
01:06
oceana some people call it oceana
01:09
africa europe uh north america
01:12
south america and is that seven we've
01:14
got asia
01:15
oceania africa europe north america
01:20
south america we're missing one
01:23
where did it go well it's not on our map
01:26
it's on the south pole it's called
01:28
antarctica right that is another huge
01:31
landmass
01:32
that is all along the bottom of your map
01:34
if you look at your world map
01:36
it's not that big of course oh
01:39
it's just the the shape of the map okay
01:41
but it's a it is a big land mass
01:44
on the south pole and those are seven
01:46
continents
01:47
continents of course are land masses
01:49
that's where people live people and
01:51
animals and plants
01:52
live there layer
01:55
now a layer is a thickness of a material
01:58
covering a surface so think about your
02:01
hand
02:02
there is a layer of skin on your hand
02:05
and the skin
02:05
covers the entire surface of your hand
02:09
so skin is a layer it's a thickness and
02:11
your skin has certain thickness
02:13
of a material that covers the surface so
02:16
whatever it is you know there is a layer
02:18
of something that covers the surface of
02:21
another thing
02:22
that is what we call the layer
02:26
crust crust is an interesting word okay
02:29
now i'm not talking about bread okay if
02:31
you bake bread
02:32
you have um the the bread gets
02:36
baked and it's soft in the middle but it
02:38
might be a little bit hard on the
02:39
outside it's a little bit browner on the
02:41
outside depending on
02:42
how you cook your bread if you cook it
02:44
too long it gets black but anyway
02:46
the brown crust of your bread is the
02:48
layer
02:50
around your bread but the earth has a
02:52
similar idea the earth has a crust as
02:54
well and that's the top
02:56
layer of the earth's surface it's the
02:59
outer part of the earth
03:00
that covers the mantle but the crust
03:03
is really thick normally we talk about
03:06
you know like the crust of bread is very
03:07
thin
03:08
the layer of my skin over my hand is
03:10
very thin but the crust of the earth
03:12
is very very thick especially in
03:15
relation to
03:16
us human beings right but that is the
03:18
crust
03:19
it is in relation to the rest of the
03:21
earth it's kind of thin
03:22
and it covers the mantle okay we'll talk
03:26
about mantle next
03:27
mantle of course is underneath the crust
03:30
that's the inner part of the earth
03:32
and it covers the core so basically
03:35
we're talking about three parts of the
03:37
earth right we have the crust here
03:39
we have the mantle here and then the
03:41
core
03:42
is here and of course the next one is
03:45
core
03:46
core the center part of the earth that's
03:48
the middle of the earth
03:50
it's very hot nobody has ever been
03:53
to the core it's too deep you can't you
03:56
can't
03:57
dig or drill that far underground nobody
04:00
has
04:00
ever done it in fact the most drills
04:04
that have ever
04:05
been done have really just poked little
04:08
holes in the crust
04:09
it's very difficult to hit to the core
04:11
except for certain places on the earth
04:13
okay but that is the we have the crust
04:15
we have the mantle and we have the core
04:17
those are the three main parts on the
04:19
inside
04:20
of the earth now the next word is
04:23
melt if something is very very hot
04:27
right you turn it from a solid to a
04:30
liquid
04:31
now you can turn rocks and
04:34
metal that is very hard and usually you
04:37
think you know
04:38
in the winter it gets very cold but you
04:40
can heat it up
04:42
so much that it can turn into a liquid
04:46
i used to work at a mining company a
04:48
gold mining company
04:49
and to get the gold from the ground and
04:51
to make gold bars they would heat
04:54
the ore and they would heat it so much
04:56
that the gold would settle on the bottom
04:58
and then they could pour it out in into
05:00
a bar and when it cooled it was a bar of
05:02
gold
05:03
it's pretty big and heavy okay so you
05:06
can melt
05:07
almost anything from a solid to a liquid
05:13
depth depth is the distance from the top
05:17
to the bottom of something so if you're
05:20
thinking this is a good picture right
05:21
so you think about the surface is up
05:24
here of the ocean
05:25
that's the surface what is the depth
05:28
that is the distance from the
05:29
from the layer of water on the surface
05:32
to the bottom
05:33
of the uh of the ocean the rock
05:36
how deep is that what is the depth we
05:39
could also say
05:40
how deep is it how deep
05:43
so we change the word a little bit how
05:46
deep is
05:47
it we change the word how deep is it and
05:51
that's an adjective right deep um and
05:54
that would be
05:55
depth is a noun what is the depth
05:59
same question the distance from the top
06:01
to the bottom
06:02
of something so you could say like the
06:03
swimming pool is the deep end
06:06
oh pandiro the opposite of deep is
06:09
shallow shallow so you have the shallow
06:12
end of the swimming pool you can stand
06:14
up but in the deep end
06:16
you cannot stand up because the depth is
06:19
more than your height okay
06:22
next above above is something that is
06:26
directly
06:27
over or higher than something now this
06:30
is an interesting picture
06:31
it shows the old idea of an iceberg
06:34
99 90 of the iceberg is below water
06:38
10 percent is above water so the part of
06:41
the iceberg that is above
06:43
the surface of the water we say it's
06:44
above and the opposite of that would be
06:47
below of course
06:48
so above directly over or higher
06:51
than something and then of course our
06:54
opposite word
06:55
is below below means to be
06:58
under something or lower than something
07:02
of course we're talking in relation to
07:03
the surface of the water
07:05
so if it's under the surface of the
07:07
water it is
07:08
below and 90 of the iceberg is below
07:12
the surface of the water now if it's in
07:15
this area
07:16
if it's over the surface of the water it
07:18
is above
07:19
above and below they are direct
07:22
opposites okay so those are our words
07:25
for the lesson
07:26
let's move on
07:30
now one of the main ideas of this lesson
07:32
of course is to find out
07:34
what is the structure of the earth and
07:37
remember we talked
07:38
about the earth having three main parts
07:41
right
07:42
we have the crust and we learn these
07:44
words in the vocabulary with the crust
07:45
which is the outer layer of the earth
07:48
the crust
07:49
is here right it's very thin well
07:51
actually in this picture
07:53
it's thicker okay that's fine this is
07:56
the crust
07:57
and then we have the mantle that's this
07:59
red part here
08:00
and then the core the center of the
08:03
earth is
08:04
the core don't be confused it looks like
08:06
it's two parts it's one part here
08:08
so the core is the center of the earth
08:11
it's very
08:12
hot there so these are the three
08:14
different parts
08:15
of the earth's structure
08:18
now what about the earth's surface right
08:20
instead of looking inside the earth what
08:22
about if we look at just the surface of
08:24
the earth well there are many different
08:27
parts of the earth's surface and we use
08:30
different words to describe
08:31
different geological features
08:34
the first is an island an island
08:38
is a small piece of land with water on
08:42
all sides so looks like we're circling
08:44
here in the caribbean where it looks
08:46
like we're circling
08:47
cuba dominican republic
08:51
puerto rico those islands that are in
08:54
the caribbean of course there are many
08:55
different islands
08:56
all over the world they're just small
08:59
areas of land
09:00
that are surrounded by water now of
09:02
course continents are also surrounded by
09:04
water but we don't really call them
09:06
islands because they're so big
09:08
they're very big usually an island is
09:10
smaller
09:11
you can cross the island in a day or you
09:14
know in a car
09:15
easily you could cross the island in a
09:17
car ease very easily it's not a very big
09:19
piece of land
09:21
okay a continent of course is a very big
09:24
piece of land it's each
09:26
big piece of land i'm talking about
09:28
really big piece of land
09:29
a continent is huge it would take
09:33
days months years to walk across our
09:37
or uh to drive across it would easily
09:39
take
09:40
days to drive across a continent but it
09:43
is surrounded it's also surrounded by
09:44
oceans and of course
09:46
uh the circle here is on south america
09:48
which is a continent you could say well
09:50
isn't it an island it's surrounded by
09:52
water
09:52
no not really because it's so big it is
09:55
a continent
09:56
okay it's not really surrounded by water
09:58
central america is attached to it right
10:00
there
10:00
anyway okay then we have ocean now ocean
10:04
is interesting
10:05
did you know that the oceans cover
10:07
three-fourths
10:08
of the earth so most of the earth
10:11
is covered with water and we call these
10:13
oceans salt water
10:15
and huge oceans of course the circle is
10:17
here is in the southern pacific
10:19
the pacific ocean is the biggest ocean
10:23
on earth and you can't even see all of
10:25
it from this map you notice
10:27
there's some more of it around the other
10:29
side
10:30
when you come to asia so the pacific
10:33
ocean
10:34
is huge and of course there's still the
10:36
atlantic ocean that we should talk about
10:38
there's the indian ocean
10:39
uh there's the arctic oceans so they're
10:44
most of the earth's surface is covered
10:46
by ocean it's a large deep body of salt
10:48
water
10:49
right not fresh water it's salty and it
10:51
covers three-fourths three-fourths of
10:54
the earth
10:55
we only live on one-fourth of the earth
10:57
human beings
10:58
can only live on one fourth on the land
11:00
but three-fourths of the earth is
11:02
covered with
11:03
water the earth is a really big place
11:06
okay okay let's do the reading together
11:10
and as we do the reading i'll read it
11:11
out loud
11:12
you guys repeat after me practice on
11:14
pronunciation
11:15
practice pronunciation don't practice on
11:17
pronunciation practice pronunciation
11:20
and focus on the words in the vocabulary
11:23
are you guys ready
11:24
here we go earth is
11:27
like a very big solid ball
11:30
from its top to its center earth
11:34
is about 6 000 kilometers
11:37
in depth earth has three layers
11:41
the crust the mantle and the core
11:47
the crust is about five to seventy
11:50
kilometers
11:51
in depth and is solid rock people live
11:56
on masses of land called continents
12:00
there are seven continents they
12:03
are part of the crust
12:09
below the crust is the mantle
12:12
which is made of rock it is about
12:15
3 000 kilometers in depth
12:19
the mantle is so hot that
12:22
some of the rock is liquid so that's
12:26
what we're seeing here
12:27
if we look at this they're really
12:28
talking about this as the mantle
12:30
maybe this is the the rock that is
12:32
melted and this is the rock
12:34
that is solid so maybe two parts of the
12:37
mantle
12:40
the crust is above the mantle and
12:43
floats on it the continents move
12:47
very very slowly that's an interesting
12:51
idea you don't
12:52
think about it land rock rock doesn't
12:54
move
12:55
but actually it does and this is a you
12:58
know that's a whole new lesson that's
12:59
continental drift theory
13:01
uh which says that the continents you
13:04
know
13:05
your land your country is moving
13:08
it's very slow and you don't notice it
13:10
it takes
13:11
uh thousands tens of thousands
13:15
millions of years to really notice it
13:17
but
13:18
it is moving and the continents are
13:20
moving around
13:22
below the mantle is the core it is about
13:26
3 000 kilometers in depth
13:30
the core is the hottest layer it is made
13:33
of metal
13:34
some of which has melted it's
13:37
so hot in the core that the metal
13:41
in the core is melted it's liquid
13:44
it's like very it's very very hot now of
13:47
course when we experience
13:50
liquid rock in nature we call it lava
13:53
and that's the material that comes up
13:57
out of a volcano right and it comes up
14:00
because it's
14:01
very hot uh underneath the earth and so
14:04
it's very hot this
14:06
this so hot that the rock is actually
14:08
liquid
14:09
right and when it there's pressure boom
14:11
it comes spewing up
14:13
out of the volcano and this of course is
14:15
a volcano
14:18
so we call that lava when the rock is
14:20
melted but though
14:21
but the volcano isn't picking up
14:24
material from the core
14:25
that's way too deep uh the volcano is
14:28
picking up material from the mantle
14:30
that's coming up to the surface okay
14:34
so how was the ideas how were the ideas
14:37
in the reading passage organized
14:39
here we have main ideas and then we have
14:41
details to support
14:43
that main idea the main idea is very
14:46
simple
14:46
earth has three layers well that's very
14:49
simple that's very easy to organize
14:51
three layers then we can talk about the
14:52
crust or the mantle and we can talk
14:55
about
14:56
we can talk about the crush sorry then
14:57
we can talk about the mantle and we can
14:59
talk about the core
15:01
okay now unfortunately these have been
15:03
uh
15:04
rearranged a little bit uh so we talk
15:06
about the crust first then we talk about
15:08
the core
15:09
then the mantle really it should be
15:11
crust mantle core
15:12
to keep it in good organization or at
15:14
the top to the bottom but anyway that's
15:16
okay
15:17
so the crust is beep the mantle excuse
15:20
me
15:20
the crust is what the mantle remember in
15:23
the vocabulary we were talking about
15:26
the relationship in terms of location
15:29
you know something might be above or
15:30
below something else
15:32
so we talk about the three layers of the
15:34
earth which layer is
15:36
on the top which layer is on the outside
15:39
we
15:40
that of course is the crust and it is
15:42
above
15:44
the mantle so that's our vocabulary word
15:46
it is above
15:48
the mantle okay then beep are part of
15:51
the crust
15:52
and they move slowly so again this is a
15:55
point i made during the
15:57
um the reading it said it but i also
15:59
talked to you about
16:00
continental drift theory that is not a
16:03
very
16:03
old scientific discovery it's only it's
16:06
just about a hundred years now uh maybe
16:09
a little bit more than
16:10
right around 100 years old only a
16:12
hundred years old
16:14
that a scientist came up with the idea
16:17
that
16:17
land moves around on the surface of the
16:20
earth
16:20
that's pretty amazing isn't it for most
16:23
of our history we didn't know that
16:26
so but what is moving around what are
16:28
these big pieces of land that move
16:30
slowly across the crust or the surface
16:33
of the earth
16:34
we call those continents continents
16:40
continents there we go continents are
16:44
part of the crust
16:45
and they move very slowly around the
16:48
surface
16:49
of the earth now we jump to the deepest
16:53
the core is the hottest layer and is
16:56
mostly made
16:57
of what well if you think about it the
16:59
heaviest
17:00
part of the earth will of course sink to
17:02
the to the very
17:04
bottom right to where the the gravity is
17:06
right and it is
17:07
what what is that what is heavier than
17:09
rock well of course metals
17:12
are heavier than rock and so the core is
17:14
mostly made of metal
17:16
however it's not solid metal most of it
17:19
is liquid metal it's
17:21
so hot there's so much pressure
17:24
at the core of the earth that pressure
17:26
creates heat
17:27
and the heat melts the metal so most of
17:30
that metal is liquid
17:31
it's like like water but don't touch it
17:36
you can't survive in the core of the
17:38
earth right
17:39
but it moves like water it moves like a
17:41
liquid so it's liquid
17:43
metal okay the mantle is the layer
17:46
in between the crust and the core and it
17:49
is so
17:50
beep that some of the rock is liquid so
17:52
the
17:53
now we're talking about rock right just
17:54
rock turning into liquid
17:56
and of course that's lava when it comes
17:58
up to the surface
17:59
the mantle is so what hot
18:02
the mantle is so hot that some of the
18:05
rock is liquid so you don't even have to
18:06
get down to the core
18:07
to get hot very hot temperatures right
18:10
the further
18:11
uh the deeper you go in the earth
18:15
the hotter it becomes because there's
18:17
more and more pressure
18:18
uh down there because there's a lot of
18:20
weight on top of things
18:22
and that pressure creates heat and that
18:25
heat will melt rock
18:26
and it will melt metal okay
18:30
so that's the reading skill that's the
18:32
also how the
18:34
ideas were organized so it's an
18:37
interesting unit i feel like it's a
18:39
little bit short but it's very simple
18:41
the earth has just three layers right
18:43
the crust
18:44
the mantle and the core and it's
18:47
very interesting to learn about our
18:49
world and remember the earth
18:51
is huge it's really really big you may
18:54
not realize it because you know you just
18:56
go to school you walk around your
18:57
neighborhood
18:58
you walk around your town maybe you take
19:00
trips to the countryside
19:02
but the earth is so big so i really
19:05
encourage you to go out there
19:06
travel explore see some of the wonders
19:09
of the earth
19:10
and think about how many different
19:13
parts of the earth there are different
19:15
land masses the earth is mostly covered
19:17
with
19:18
water there's a lot of amazing and
19:20
interesting things to discover
19:22
and also if we go deep into the earth we
19:25
can
19:25
we can also discover some more amazing
19:27
things
19:28
okay so anyway that's our lesson for
19:30
today thanks for studying with me
19:32
we'll see you in the next one take care
19:36
everybody
19:43
[Music]
19:50
me
19:54
you
