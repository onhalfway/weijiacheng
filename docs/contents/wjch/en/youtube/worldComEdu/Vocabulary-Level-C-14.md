strong we'll look at that in the
vocabulary in this lesson
we're going to learn about mighty paul
bunyan
he's an imaginary character we can see
him here
whoa he's really tall isn't he
paul bunyan was thought to be a giant
right now people think you know is there
a real person
sometimes stories are based on a real
person and people were thinking
was there a real person named paul
bunyan
we're not sure this story
he's a character in a folk tale a
folk tale folk tales
are stories that people tell each other
from a long time
ago and sometimes folk tales
might have a true story as the beginning
we but we don't know because nobody
wrote it down
they just told each other for many many
years
and sometimes the story grows and gets
bigger
and the characters change a little bit
maybe there was a really big uh
character a long time ago who was like
paul bunyan
but nowadays when we think about paul
bunyan
we think about a giant right he's many
meters tall
right and he has an ax here this is an
ax and what does he do he cuts down
trees his folk tale the folk tales
about paul bunyan were a long time ago
in america when many men went into the
forest and cut down
trees for wood because the
nation america needed wood to build
houses and to build many things
so there were many people like him
in the world and so these stories
started but who's that
what is this this is a big blue cow
well actually it's not a cow it's an ox
it's
a babe whoops
babe his name was babe
the blue
babe the blue ox and we'll learn about
his character
later but babe the blue ox and paul
bunyan
they were partners right they were
friends
okay and babe the blue ox was a big uh
kind of like a cow an
ox is like a cow but it's a very big
and strong cow with big horns as you can
see
so these are the characters we're going
to learn about today
in this lesson but first let's start
with the vocabulary words
first of all we have this person he
looks familiar
he kind of looks like paul bunyan but
this word is a person who cuts down
trees this describes paul
bunyan's job what was paul bunyan's job
what was he he was a whoa that's a big
word
a lumberjack lumber
jack now you may know the word lumber
lumber is wood wood from trees is lumber
jack maybe just the name of a person
lumberjack is a person who cuts down
trees paul bunyan was a lumberjack
okay next one a small
fire at a camp do you ever go camping
with your friends or your family
sometimes maybe your family takes you to
soraksan
or waraksan or chirisan
right there's many mountains in korea
you can go
camping at night sometimes the family
will sit around
this it's a small fire at a camp it's
actually
a camp fire camp fire
see we use these two words together and
it's called
campfire so you build a little fire at
your camp
and many people will tell stories around
the campfire
and so we can think of many imaginary
characters
like paul bunyan people are telling
stories
around the camp fire okay next one
oh okay these kids are having a fun time
they look very happy don't they
they're listening to a story another
word for a story is a tale
tale and story right
it means the same thing a story
is a tale before i taught you folk
tale right folk tale is like folk story
you could say either one okay so
story entail same thing next one
total a total so if everybody gets
together
they are the total they are the whole
let's say these
people are working together they are a
whole
team right they are the total sum
of the team if one person is missing
they're not whole
they must be together to have the team
maybe an office
team in the office or some type of
organization they are the whole team but
it's not just people
right it can be a set of toys
if you have five different toys they
make the total set
they are the whole set so in that case
you could say
the whole set of toys
the whole set of food the whole set
of whatever the whole they're all
together
okay the next picture wow this is a very
beautiful picture of nature right
don't you want to go there this is a
place without
people there's nobody in this
place it's um nobody lives there
maybe people have walked through there
before but if you look at the picture
there's nobody there and there's no sign
of any human
activity this is what we call wilderness
wilderness that's a long word wilderness
wilderness now i said will der ness
but actually it comes from this word
here wild
if you think of just nature right just
nature
nature natural is wild it's in the wild
right
we we don't live in the wild we live in
villages
or towns or cities but
if we go away from all of that and
there's no sign of
any human activity that's just nature
it's in the wild
okay and we call places like that
wilderness
there's no homes no roads no telephones
maybe you can have your cell phone maybe
you have coverage
but there's nothing there except for
nature
trees mountains
meadows forest you know things like that
that's wilderness
okay next next is an area where fruit
trees are grown this is not wilderness
right this is a farm it's a place
especially it's a
an area where fruit trees are grown we
have a special name for this
kind of farm it's called an orchard
orchard orchard so if you wonder where
do your apples
come from right where do oranges come
from
where do cherries come from right
cherries mashita right
where do they come from they come from
trees and these
trees are grown in a field like this
they're not just you know random trees
out in nature
farmers will plant the cherry trees or
the apple trees or the orange trees
in rows so they're all there and they're
easy to pick
and that's called an orchard right so if
you want to get
fresh fruit and very cheap go to the
orchard
in the fall that's when the fruit is
ready it's ripe
and it's ready to eat it's a good place
to go right so that's an
orchard okay next one ah
don't you want to go scuba diving do you
want to see this underwater
a wild and exciting experience if you go
scuba diving
you will have an adventure because you
can see the coral and the fish
maybe other scuba divers looking at you
right
we can see this is an adventure
adventure
an adventure is an exciting time it's so
maybe a
wild time wild maybe you go into nature
or wild also means
not controlled you don't know what's
going to happen
right so it can be an adventure because
you don't know what's going to happen
and it's very exciting what does happen
that's an adventure okay next one these
kids are having fun right
with great happiness what do we say
joyously
joy you know the word joy joy
is happy right you say kibuni
right kibani choi that's joy i'm very
happy
but we say joyously it means with great
happiness
this describes how you do something or
how something is done if you
watch a tv show and you watch it
with a lot of happiness you are watching
joyously okay if you're reading a book
ah
nomo chemisoil right very good book
and you really are happy when you read
the book
you read the book joyously
so this word goes with a verb read
joyously watch joyously
play joyously so this word goes with
verbs to describe how
the action is done okay next one
twisting have you ever been on a road
like this
this is a very adventurous road right
but a twisting and twisting another word
for twisting
is winding to twist
right and to wind they're kind of
similar this is wind not wind
okay spelled the same but different
pronunciation
twist means to twist something right you
take a ribbon
and you twist it so it's not straight
you twist it
wind also can be uh like this you take a
string
and you wind the string you can wind the
string
around something else it just means not
straight
right it's winding or twisting
like a road this is a very fun road to
ride your bike on right we
you go around the curbs but be careful
there might be a car
so joshua hale but it's a very fun road
to be on right
okay so twisting or winding it's a
winding
road next one look at that that's crazy
one eye big nose one tooth and a foot
what kind of crazy thing is that it's
unreal or fictional
it's not real right so we can say it's
imaginary you guys imaginary
right big word e
neri
neri wow five sounds altogether
in one word imaginary if we think about
it
you can see this word imagine and if we
put an
e right imagine means to think
of something not real but to have an
idea
of something different if you can
imagine
yourself in a different world sometimes
when you read books
you can imagine yourself like in a
spaceship
or on another planet or
fighting dragons with the sword right
this is what we imagine
it's all imaginary those things
so it's not real it's fictional i've
never seen a character like this right
it's not real it's imaginary
just in people's minds in your
imagination you can also say
imagination that's the noun right
imagination is the place
in your head where you think of these
things or it's the
the ideas that you have
it's your imagination is your
imagination good do you have a good
imagination that means you can imagine
many different things i hope you have a
good imagination
i'm sure you do okay next one
uh oh what happened here to hold
something together with a rope
right now this is an extreme example
usually you hold your shoe together with
rope
don't tie people up with rope right but
what this
is is tie i just use that word tie tie
is a verb to hold something together
with a rope
so if they these two people are tied
together
they're tied together now normally we
tie things in our life
if you have a shoe with shoe laces
you tie the shoelaces together that's
very common
many people do that every day so that
just
to hold something with a rope you tie it
also if you have many things you want to
carry from one place to another you
could put packages
or your backpack you could tie it to the
back of your bicycle
and it doesn't fall off when you ride to
school
so you could tie many things with rope
okay next one whoa looks like a strong
person there do you lift weights
this person is lifting weights
lift weights to lift
weights and you get very big muscles
right
okay very strong and powerful another
word for this
person is mighty we saw this word before
on the title mighty paul bunyan
so it means that paul bunyan the
imaginary character
is very strong and he's really powerful
he can do many things with his body
because he's
really strong he's very powerful okay
next one to move something from side to
side very fast
so if something's moving like this if
you take something in your hand and you
move it like this or up and down
you know around let's say you want to
mix
something right so you have ice and
lemonade
and you mix it like this what are you
doing
you are shaking to shake you can also
just shake your body
like this right if you're cold people
shake
okay stop shaking okay stop shaking so
shake
is to shake also very common what else
do we shake
we shake hands right when we meet
another person
we shake their hands that's what western
people do
especially in america right in korea we
usually bow
but in america they usually shake the
hands of the person
and that's like saying hello how are you
sheikh
is an irregular verb so we use it
it changes form in the past okay so we
say
shake shook shaken
okay shake shook shaken
that's how we use this word in the past
it's an irregular verb
okay next one here is
another picture of a it looks like a cow
right
but it looks like a little bit of a
strange cow it's not a normal cow
look at this it's a bull used for farm
work right
so it's a bull a bull means namja
right not yoja namja so it's a namja
cow okay but it's used for farm work and
look
it's got these big horns whoa okay
it's got a big hump on its back and it
looks very strong
right there's a special word we use for
that it's
ox aha remember paul bunyan's
friend i told you about before was a big
blue
ox okay so that's an imaginary character
but it's based on this type of animal a
bull
of a namja a male cow used
for working on the farm they you know
you can
tie something to the ox and it will pull
something
usually farmers use the oxes to help
them
plow the field plow the
field and what they do is they put a big
blade like a big piece of iron and the
ox drags it on the ground and it digs
a line and the farmers can plant their
plants in that line so oxes are used to
plow the field that's called
to plow the field and so oxes and horses
are used
to do that okay but oxes are very strong
and
they may be stronger than horses
sometimes okay
15. oh no it's terrible right
mogi right a mosquito came and
bit her on the arm we can see that
we all know that right oh i hate that
mogi shiraiyo right
i really hate the mosquitoes a feeling
on your skin
that you want to scratch so if a
mosquito came
and bit you right you have a feeling
you want to scratch it what is that
feeling we say it's an
itch right i have an itch i
excuse me i have an itch
i have an itch on my arm
when i wear shorts right
and at night time if i'm in the forest
all the mosquitoes really bite my ankles
ah i hate it i have an itch on my ankles
on my foot ah normal should i all right
so i have an
itch i have an itch you can also say
my foot
itches whoops it
chis so itch can be a noun
it can also be used as a verb it itches
my foot itches oh my hand itches
uh it itches like i have a bite i just
say
it itches so it can be a noun i have an
itch
or verb it itches okay
what do you do you scratch
scratch and itch don't say i itch my arm
no that's crazy you don't itch your arm
your arm itches
so you scratch it okay but be careful
don't scratch it too much
because that's not good if your hand is
dirty
and you scratch it too hard you might
break the skin and then it can get
infected so be careful
right don't scratch too much i know it's
terrible it drives you crazy
i hate itching right but
maybe put some cream on it or some
medicine
okay okay next one okay to use an
ax to make something fall so before we
talked about
lumberjacks right that was our first
word a lumberjacks usually use an
axe and they chop down
chop down trees so they they hit the
tree with the axe
and the tree falls down
so chop down means to use an axe
to make something fall oh by the way
look at this
axe before on the first picture when i
was talking about paul bunyan
i looked at his axe and i spelled it
that way ax
it doesn't matter you can spell it a x
or a x e
both spellings are acceptable in english
okay so don't be confused about that one
okay acts or
acts okay next one oh that's it for the
words let's go into the

about it
like i said most of us we live in

there were no no stores there was no
sign of human beings at
all and we were living there right we

words for going down now
number two he went to africa for and
what if you go to africa right it's a
different place
uh different people different style of
architecture
many wild animals very beautiful scenery
right so what will you have you'll have
a
wild and exciting time won't you
what means wild and excitable time
probably this word here adventure he
went to
africa for an adventure so many people
travel to another place for an adventure
okay so you might go to uh
south america for an adventure if you
really want a
a very amazing adventure maybe you go to
the north pole or south pole
and of course you can go to africa for
an adventure too in fact
almost anywhere you go if it's wild and
exciting
it could be an adventure okay the next
word still going down
number three a
long word is cutting down a tree but in
this sentence we're looking for the
subject right the subject how do we know
because here's the verb
so a someone or something is
doing this what are they doing cutting
down a tree
now remember in the vocabulary section
it was our first
word we talked about a person
who cuts down a tree so we're looking
for the person it's a
job title of a person whose job it is to
cut down
trees which word means
a person whose job it is to cut down
trees of course it's over here
lumberjack
really long word a lumberjack is
cutting down a tree so lumberjack it's
like the song
maybe you don't know it it's a long time
ago it goes
i'm a lumberjack and i'm okay
i cut chop down trees i eat my lunch and
i go to the lava tree
okay so it's kind of it's an old song
it's kind of a funny song by a british
group called
monty python look them up but
lumberjack what does he do i'm a
lumberjack and i'm okay
i cut down trees i eat my lunch
and i go to the lavatory lavatory what's
lavatory i have to teach you that
because it's
in the song a lavatory and sometimes
people say
lavora lavatory but in the song it's
it's you can also pronounce it lavatory
lavatory
is another word for bathroom and english
is crazy
we have so many words for bathroom
bathroom of course is
hua jiang chill right so you can say
where is the bathroom
where is the bath room
sometimes people call it the rest
room where is the rest room
some people even say where is the i'll
put it up here
where is the toilet but that's
not so polite it's more polite to say
bathroom restroom or lavatory
or lavatory right restroom bathroom
lavatory
toilet okay also one more wc but that's
a little old-fashioned
wc what is wc wc
is water closet
because a long time ago
when the toilet was first invented
it was put into people's houses they
didn't know what to call it
it's like a small room in the house
that's a closet
but it had water in it you know a long
time ago before
when people didn't have they weren't
used to having
water in the house plumbing was new so
they called it a water closet
some people in some countries still call
it water closet but it's a little
old-fashioned
americans usually say bathroom or
restroom
lavatory or lavatory water closet
more common in england or britain
okay americans will normally say
bathroom or
restroom anyway that's a very long
explanation
we came from lumberjack from the song
i'm a lumberjack and i'm okay
i chop down trees i eat my lunch and i
go to the lavatory
okay so that's kind of funny anyway
that's lumberjack next one
down four down we sat around the what
you sit around what would you sit around
especially when you're with your family
you're out in the woods you're having a
good time
camping so what would you at night
right you build a fire and what would
you sit around you'd sit around that
fire what do we call that fire
remember you're camping so we call that
a camp
fire we sat around the campfire
okay number five our last word here
going down
number five we sang together
okay kind of a long word one two three
four five six seven eight
we're looking for an eight letter word
that tells us
what that tells us how did we
sing when i taught you this word
remember i said that this word is used
with verbs
it tells us how we do something
and the examples i used were you know if
you watch television and you're very
happy
how do you watch television if you read
a book and it makes you feel
happy how do you read the book right how
do you do these
actions how did you sing together
which word tells us how did you sing
together
well it would be this word right here
right we sang together
joyously so we were very happy and we
sang together joyously do you guys want
to sing together joyously
remember the song about the lumberjack
everybody
i'm a lumberjack and i'm okay i cut
down trees i eat my lunch and i go to
the lavatory
okay if you sing that with a lot of
happiness
you sing joyously okay
well that wraps up the vocabulary
section let's take a short break now
and we'll come back and take a look at
the reading section about mighty paul
