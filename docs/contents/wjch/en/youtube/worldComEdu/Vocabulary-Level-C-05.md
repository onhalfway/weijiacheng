hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary i'm brian stewart
we're going over lesson five now the
title for lesson five
is never a warm day
never a warm day well obviously we're
not
talking about korea because korea has
many warm days right that's good right
we don't want
to be cold all the time but we're
talking about a place
that never has a warm day so we're going
to focus on
let's learn about the arctic in the
arctic
there's never a warm day it's always
cold
so we're talking about geography that
falls under
social studies well first of all let's
talk about the arctic
as you can see it's very cold
in the arctic right very cold never
a warm day it never gets very warm there
it's always covered with snow and ice
and the animals that live there are used
to the
cold weather in the arctic okay let's
begin with our vocabulary
frost just jumped on up in there right a
covering of
ice so when it's really cold outside
right
and you can see the plants or the grass
the trees are covered with a very thin
covering of ice we call that frost
frost is on the grass frost is on the
trees
frost is on your windows sometimes
okay so it's a thin covering of ice that
covers things
when it's very cold number two
well she's very she must be a famous
person right
she looks like a famous singer liked by
many people
of course i just gave you the answer
famous or popular
i said famous before it's a synonym
it means the same thing famous
popular many people like that
person or thing it is popular
or it is famous okay
number three now imagine if you lived
here
uh this is your dog and you live at a
home near here
the only way to get to your home is by
boat
wow that is a far away place
or remote it is remote
remote means far away or hard
to get to right if you live in an island
you can't drive a car there right
there's no roads
you have to take a boat it's far away
from a city
so it's hard to get to it's remote
remote
remote okay next word
what is she doing that's very strange
isn't it
this woman is not common
she's not behaving in a normal
common way it's not common if it's not
common
it's unusual
she's being very unusual here
most people don't eat their keyboards
i don't recommend you to eat your
keyboard i don't recommend
that as a good practice so it's very
unusual for someone to eat
their keyboard we can also use another
word maybe you've heard before
weird right she's being
weird strange unusual
okay she's not common okay next one
uh do we have a nice picture here okay
uh of a fortune teller to say that
something
will happen in the future now the word i
use to describe her for
choon teller in
korea this is kind of a popular thing
especially if you go to the old parks
around in seoul or
some of the places i think you say in
korean
right i don't know if you say say
right that is a fortune teller someone
who says what will happen in the future
now
what do they do what do fortune tellers
do
what do chom jiangi what do they do they
predict predict predict
they say what's going to happen
in the future is it true
well you have to you have to think about
that right
you have to judge for yourself can you
predict
the future okay next one
to give off light the sun of course
gives off light
light bulbs in our house give off light
what are they doing
they are shining to shine
shine not sign shine
sh shh don't not be quiet but
shine to shine means to give off light
to give off light is to shine now shine
is an
irregular verb so we say shine shown
shown shine shown shown to describe
this verb in the past or this action in
the past
okay number seven oh my gosh i feel
sorry for him
he's very very cold isn't he oh my gosh
he looks like an
ice cube
he's extremely cold very cold
right you say that chinchu or aju ajucho
ayo
right very cold what do we say
there's another word frigid fridgid
frigid if something is frigid it's
really really cold go into your kitchen
open your freezer stick your head inside
it's frigid
don't do that your mom will get angry
okay but it's very cold
frigid eight something
that is completely different something
that's different so
some people say incinerator is good
other people say incinerator no thank
you we don't want it
so you have two sides you have maybe a
pro and a con
you have what other type of sides you
can say
opposite opposite sides these people are
on the opposite side right
opposite opposite opposite
so if an argument you know you have some
people saying it's good
another person say it's bad these are
opposite
sides okay number nine
a person who visits a place for pleasure
where is this this looks like it's in
venice italy you can tell by the stripes
on the shirts that's their trademark
also of course they have the canals
that go through the city looks like
venice a person
but if you go to venice and you go there
to look around wow it's really cool
people get by on boats look at the
buildings
look at the uh the food let's
let's experience a new place for
pleasure for entertainment
then you call that person a tourist you
are a
tourist if you go to these places for
pleasure
to travel for pleasure that is a tourist
okay next one i'm sure you have some of
these
in your room right i hope you do because
books are good right
and a book of stories for children we
can call those what
a book of stories we just use this word
and we use this word and we put them
together
what do we have we have a story book
so a storybook of course is a book of
stories it has a story or several
stories in it
it's a storybook next one
an area of the earth so an area of the
earth especially
farmers use this to grow crops
what do we call it of course it's land
they need land
to grow food so an area of the earth
is land
the area around the north pole now it's
maybe a little hard to see but if you
look closely you can start to recognize
some of the shapes here
this is north america here this is
greenland greenland it's not green it's
white
but we don't say white land we say green
land that's
history okay the greenland and of course
here we have the top of
asia this is russia around here korea's
down over here right
so what were we looking at we're looking
at the area
around the north pole what do we call
that area
there's a special word for it we already
talked about it it's called
the arctic arctic
we don't say really we don't really
pronounce that c
we don't say arctic that's him
right we say arctic arctic we don't
really pronounce the sea
it's not arctic it's arctic arctic
okay arctic that's the area around the
north pole
it's very cold up there next one
in the place of something or somebody
in the place of something or somebody
it's kind of a difficult
word it is instead instead of
right so instead of cars these people
are riding bicycles right and instead of
bicycles
these people are riding cars so in the
place of something or
somebody if you say not this one
but another thing instead of this then
that
okay next one number 14 what we
ride over snow and ice now in the arctic
it's very
cold you can't really make a road
because it snows
too much if you make a road after a
month
you can't see the road anymore because
it's covered with snow
so people don't have cars they use these
things
to move around what are they called
they're called
sleds a sled maybe you have a sled
when it gets cold in the winter time you
might take a sled
to the hill and ride down the sled for
fun a lot of kids do that
they ride a sled over snow in the arctic
they use
dogs to pull the sled and that's how
they get around
because cars are not very useful in the
arctic or very cold
areas sleds are better
the next one a small round house made of
snow
you've probably seen these before right
and when it's very cold
people will make these out of ice
they'll make them out of snow
it's a little house very interesting
house right chimi soil right
how would you like to live there maybe a
little bit cold
but it's actually warm inside it's
warmer inside
than outside what is it called it's
called an
igloo igloo right and igloo is a house
made of
snow or ice in the arctic or antarctic
to sense sounds now of course we have
many organs
in our head that we use to know what's
going on around us
right when we use our eyes we're seeing
when we use our mouth
our tongue we're tasting but when we use
our ears
what are we doing then we are hearing
to hear is to sense sounds
right now you are listening to me you
are hearing
the noises the sounds that i'm making
it here is an irregular verb hear heard
heard so uh maybe
you heard me yesterday too as
also today maybe you're studying very
hard right so here heard heard
we use herd to describe sensing sounds
in the past okay let's go
for the reading of the vocabulary
exercises sorry the
vocabulary exercises we have several
words here
we need to fill in the blanks very easy
exercise right
so we have our sentences we need to use
these words to complete
each sentence let's go over the words
the first one is
frost frost then
popular popular
then unusual unusual
next one is shine shine
next one frigid frigid
frigid right opposite
opposite next one remote
remote and the next one predict
predict okay so let's use these words
figure out
how we can put them into the sentences
number one i got cold
i got cold i became cold because of the
peep weather what kind of weather makes
you
cold what kind of weather makes you cold
probably this word is what we're looking
for frigid
very cold remember frigid is very cold
so if the weather is very cold
you become cold you will get cold
i got cold because of the frigid weather
number two oh by the way it's
interesting
this says i got cold that just means you
are not warm anymore but if you
add one little word and you put
a i got a cold it's completely different
that means you got sick up i o i got a
cold
chew at you right i got a cold i became
sick
because of the frigid weather but if you
don't use a and you just say i got cold
it just means your body was cold you
didn't get sick you go inside
you get warm no problem so it's
sometimes in english
it's very important whether you use a or
no a
changes the meaning okay just a little
note
number two after the heavy rain so
after it rained very heavily after the
heavy rain
the sun began to what
so after it rains the clouds go away
you can see the sun the sun begins to
what
give off light it begins to shine
okay so the sun began to shine after the
heavy rain
number three the arctic is a very
beep place not many people go to the
arctic it's very difficult to live there
like i said before you can't really
build a road
in the arctic so it's hard to get to the
arctic
a place that is hard to get to is
remote the arctic is a very remote
place it's hard to get to
number four in winter his car window was
covered with what
i talked about this when we talked about
this word when it's really cold
outside there will be a covering of
ice on plants on grass
on your windows what do we call that ice
we call that ice frost so in winter
his car window was covered with
frost okay number five
the beep of hot is cold
interesting hot and cold pandero right
they are what they are opposites so the
opposite of hot is cold
right the opposite of happy
is sad right the opposite of tall
is short okay so the opposite of
a is b right that's a good thing of
course a and b
are opposites pandero okay number six
i can't beep the result of the match
the result of the match match here means
like game
or contest for example a soccer match
right do you know who will win sometimes
it's hard to tell
it's very difficult to know the future
so
i can't when you know the future you you
probably don't know the future of course
it's very
difficult to know the future it's very
difficult to know
who will win the match which team will
win
so it's difficult to predict i can't
predict
the result of the match i don't know i
can't
tell the future okay i'm not a champion
right okay next one number seven he is a
very beep
singer in korea so we're looking for
something that has to do with singer or
entertainers or actors
of course if a singer is to be
successful
many people have to like that person
so if we're talking about somebody who
is
many people like them he is a very what
he's a very
popular singer in korea
and number eight she is a girl with what
ability she is a girl with some type of
ability
the only word left of course but also
we're looking for something that's
makes her unique makes her different
from other people
she's a girl with unusual ability
of course people with unusual ability
you know could be a good thing
somebody who sings very well that's not
common that's unusual
somebody who has a very good voice so
somebody who has an unusual talent
they can become famous as an entertainer
or
even or in many other fields right if
you have an unusual
ability to do math in your head you can
become
a scientist or a teacher or a
mathematician
right so if you have an unusual ability
sometimes that's very good
it's not common you should develop that
ability
okay anyway that wraps it up with the
vocabulary let's take a short break now
and we'll take a look at the reading
section in a few minutes

ice so when it's really cold outside
01:25
right

08:13
farmers use this to grow crops
08:16
what do we call it of course it's land
08:19
they need land
08:20
to grow food so an area of the earth
08:23
is land
08:27
the area around the north pole now it's
08:30
maybe a little hard to see but if you
08:32
look closely you can start to recognize
08:34
some of the shapes here
08:35
this is north america here this is
08:39
greenland greenland it's not green it's
08:41
white
08:42
but we don't say white land we say green
08:44
land that's
08:45
history okay the greenland and of course
08:47
here we have the top of
08:49
asia this is russia around here korea's
08:52
down over here right
08:53
so what were we looking at we're looking
08:55
at the area
08:56
around the north pole what do we call
09:00
that area
09:00
there's a special word for it we already
09:02
talked about it it's called
09:04
the arctic arctic
09:07
we don't say really we don't really
09:09
pronounce that c
09:10
we don't say arctic that's him
09:14
right we say arctic arctic we don't
09:16
really pronounce the sea
09:18
it's not arctic it's arctic arctic
09:22
okay arctic that's the area around the
09:25
north pole
09:26
it's very cold up there next one
09:29
in the place of something or somebody
09:32
in the place of something or somebody
09:34
it's kind of a difficult
09:36
word it is instead instead of
09:39
right so instead of cars these people
09:43
are riding bicycles right and instead of
09:46
bicycles
09:46
these people are riding cars so in the
09:49
place of something or
09:51
somebody if you say not this one
09:54
but another thing instead of this then
09:57
that
09:58
okay next one number 14 what we
10:01
ride over snow and ice now in the arctic
10:05
it's very
10:06
cold you can't really make a road
10:09
because it snows
10:10
too much if you make a road after a
10:12
month
10:13
you can't see the road anymore because
10:15
it's covered with snow
10:16
so people don't have cars they use these
10:20
things
10:21
to move around what are they called
10:23
they're called
10:24
sleds a sled maybe you have a sled
10:28
when it gets cold in the winter time you
10:31
might take a sled
10:32
to the hill and ride down the sled for
10:34
fun a lot of kids do that
10:36
they ride a sled over snow in the arctic
10:39
they use
10:39
dogs to pull the sled and that's how
10:42
they get around
10:43
because cars are not very useful in the
10:46
arctic or very cold
10:47
areas sleds are better
10:50
the next one a small round house made of
10:53
snow
10:54
you've probably seen these before right
10:57
and when it's very cold
10:58
people will make these out of ice
11:00
they'll make them out of snow
11:02
it's a little house very interesting
11:04
house right chimi soil right
11:06
how would you like to live there maybe a
11:09
little bit cold
11:10
but it's actually warm inside it's
11:12
warmer inside
11:14
than outside what is it called it's
11:16
called an
11:17
igloo igloo right and igloo is a house
11:21
made of
11:22
snow or ice in the arctic or antarctic
11:27
to sense sounds now of course we have
11:29
many organs
11:30
in our head that we use to know what's
11:34
going on around us
11:35
right when we use our eyes we're seeing
11:38
when we use our mouth
11:39
our tongue we're tasting but when we use
11:42
our ears
11:43
what are we doing then we are hearing
11:47
to hear is to sense sounds
11:50
right now you are listening to me you
11:53
are hearing
11:54
the noises the sounds that i'm making
11:57
it here is an irregular verb hear heard
12:01
heard so uh maybe
12:04
you heard me yesterday too as
12:08
also today maybe you're studying very
12:10
hard right so here heard heard
12:12
we use herd to describe sensing sounds
12:16
in the past okay let's go
12:19
for the reading of the vocabulary
12:21
exercises sorry the
12:22
vocabulary exercises we have several
12:24
words here
12:25
we need to fill in the blanks very easy
12:27
exercise right
12:28
so we have our sentences we need to use
12:31
these words to complete
12:32
each sentence let's go over the words
12:35
the first one is
12:36
frost frost then
12:40
popular popular
12:43
then unusual unusual
12:48
next one is shine shine
12:52
next one frigid frigid
12:56
frigid right opposite
13:00
opposite next one remote
13:04
remote and the next one predict
13:09
predict okay so let's use these words
13:12
figure out
13:13
how we can put them into the sentences
13:16
number one i got cold
13:19
i got cold i became cold because of the
13:22
peep weather what kind of weather makes
13:26
you
13:26
cold what kind of weather makes you cold
13:30
probably this word is what we're looking
13:32
for frigid
13:34
very cold remember frigid is very cold
13:37
so if the weather is very cold
13:39
you become cold you will get cold
13:42
i got cold because of the frigid weather
13:45
number two oh by the way it's
13:47
interesting
13:49
this says i got cold that just means you
13:52
are not warm anymore but if you
13:54
add one little word and you put
13:57
a i got a cold it's completely different
14:01
that means you got sick up i o i got a
14:03
cold
14:04
chew at you right i got a cold i became
14:07
sick
14:08
because of the frigid weather but if you
14:10
don't use a and you just say i got cold
14:12
it just means your body was cold you
14:14
didn't get sick you go inside
14:16
you get warm no problem so it's
14:19
sometimes in english
14:20
it's very important whether you use a or
14:23
no a
14:24
changes the meaning okay just a little
14:26
note
14:27
number two after the heavy rain so
14:30
after it rained very heavily after the
14:33
heavy rain
14:34
the sun began to what
14:38
so after it rains the clouds go away
14:41
you can see the sun the sun begins to
14:44
what
14:44
give off light it begins to shine
14:48
okay so the sun began to shine after the
14:51
heavy rain
14:53
number three the arctic is a very
14:57
beep place not many people go to the
15:01
arctic it's very difficult to live there
15:03
like i said before you can't really
15:06
build a road
15:07
in the arctic so it's hard to get to the
15:09
arctic
15:10
a place that is hard to get to is
15:14
remote the arctic is a very remote
15:17
place it's hard to get to
15:21
number four in winter his car window was
15:24
covered with what
15:26
i talked about this when we talked about
15:28
this word when it's really cold
15:30
outside there will be a covering of
15:33
ice on plants on grass
15:37
on your windows what do we call that ice
15:40
we call that ice frost so in winter
15:44
his car window was covered with
15:47
frost okay number five
15:51
the beep of hot is cold
15:54
interesting hot and cold pandero right
15:58
they are what they are opposites so the
16:01
opposite of hot is cold
16:05
right the opposite of happy
16:08
is sad right the opposite of tall
16:12
is short okay so the opposite of
16:15
a is b right that's a good thing of
16:18
course a and b
16:19
are opposites pandero okay number six
16:22
i can't beep the result of the match
16:26
the result of the match match here means
16:28
like game
16:29
or contest for example a soccer match
16:33
right do you know who will win sometimes
16:36
it's hard to tell
16:37
it's very difficult to know the future
16:40
so
16:41
i can't when you know the future you you
16:44
probably don't know the future of course
16:45
it's very
16:45
difficult to know the future it's very
16:48
difficult to know
16:49
who will win the match which team will
16:52
win
16:53
so it's difficult to predict i can't
16:56
predict
16:57
the result of the match i don't know i
17:00
can't
17:00
tell the future okay i'm not a champion
17:04
right okay next one number seven he is a
17:07
very beep
17:08
singer in korea so we're looking for
17:11
something that has to do with singer or
17:13
entertainers or actors
17:15
of course if a singer is to be
17:18
successful
17:19
many people have to like that person
17:23
so if we're talking about somebody who
17:26
is
17:27
many people like them he is a very what
17:30
he's a very
17:30
popular singer in korea
17:34
and number eight she is a girl with what
17:37
ability she is a girl with some type of
17:41
ability
17:42
the only word left of course but also
17:44
we're looking for something that's
17:46
makes her unique makes her different
17:49
from other people
17:51
she's a girl with unusual ability
17:54
of course people with unusual ability
17:56
you know could be a good thing
17:59
somebody who sings very well that's not
18:01
common that's unusual
18:02
somebody who has a very good voice so
18:04
somebody who has an unusual talent
18:07
they can become famous as an entertainer
18:10
or
18:10
even or in many other fields right if
18:12
you have an unusual
18:14
ability to do math in your head you can
18:17
become
18:18
a scientist or a teacher or a
18:21
mathematician
18:22
right so if you have an unusual ability
18:25
sometimes that's very good
18:26
it's not common you should develop that
18:28
ability
18:29
okay anyway that wraps it up with the
18:32
vocabulary let's take a short break now
18:34
