hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading
i'm your host brian stewart today we're
looking at
book three lesson four and the title of
this lesson
is animals with and
without backbones
we'll talk about that shortly in this
lesson
you will discover names for body parts
and also how to classify
different types of animals
interesting let's get started okay
first of all like i said the title of
the unit is
animals with and without backbones
but what is a backbone
a backbone is the line of bones
down your back now don't be confused
about this
it looks like oh backbone is one bone
no the backbone is many different
smaller bones in in us in human beings
and most other animals they're little
discs
it's like a little disc and they stack
on top of each other
and it's a line of bones and they're all
connected with tissue
but these little bones it's kind of a
difficult word
let me spell it for you ver
bray so verta
bray vertebrae vertebrae that's a little
more of a difficult word more of a
scientific word maybe a medical word
most people just say backbone but it's
not one bone
it's many bones in fact in humans we
have
33 of these bones
33 vertebrae wow that's
many bones connected by tissue
in our back from our neck all the way to
our the bottom of our back so those are
vertebrae
that is the backbone and of course many
other bones
like your ribs come out from the
backbone
the backbone is very important for us
and many animals like us
but not all living things have backbones
we'll see that
okay continue next we have covering
now here's an animal i guess animal
insect
that does not have a backbone instead
it has a covering cover
to cover means to put on top of
something
when you get in bed at night you pull up
the cover right it covers you
some animals have a covering it's a hard
covering right
uh a covering is just a layer of
something
a layer of something over something else
like you
in your bed you have a covering a
blanket over you
it covers you it's a layer of blanket or
material cotton whatever over you when
you sleep
to keep you warm insects have a hard
covering
right that protects them they don't have
a backbone
okay next shell a
shell is a type of covering
think about a crab right um
don't get hungry okay but a shell the
hard outer covering of some animals
is a shell right you see crabs are very
tough
aren't they they've got the hard shell
on their back
what's another animal with a shell a
snail
right snails have shells
also they carry the covering
around on their back let's take a look
at a video
of an interesting crab
changing its shell okay let's take a
look at this this is what we call a
hermit crab right he backed into that
shell
he put it on his back and now he's got a
new home
sometimes you can see hermit crabs
hermit h-e-r-m-i-t
hermit crab a
hermit crab it grows but the shell
doesn't grow
so when the hermit crab gets too big he
can't
fit in his shell anymore what does he do
he gets out of his shell and finds a new
shell and then he has a new home okay
so very interesting hermit crabs are
very interesting
sometimes they're cute too right okay
next word is hop hop is a verb right
and maybe you play some games where you
hop
hop means to jump but not a long
jump a short jump like hop hop hop
right if you play hop scotch right
hop scotch
that's a game i'm sure you're familiar
with it
in america i think it has been a long
time since i played
hopscotch but usually people will have
a diagram like this right
and they will hop they'll hop in the
first square
then they'll hop in the second square
and they hop and they put
both legs here for this one and they hop
both legs here
so this one's kind of like that yeah
it's it's
called hopscotch and it's a game that
kids play and they hop
this little jumps from uh one
position to another and we can see a
video of
something hopping look at this bird uh
it's going to hop right it's moving
around
now see how it hops it doesn't walk
right it
hops right it goes from place to place
by hopping birds don't walk very well
their bodies aren't built to walk
but they can hop very well and of course
they can fly very well too
so that is to hop okay
now birds can also glide and some other
not just birds but
mammals this is a bat okay and
animals with wings can
glide glide means to fly
by floating on the air right so
in other words the bat or the bird
doesn't have to
uh beat its wings it doesn't have to
beat or
flap sometimes you could say flap
it's wings
right beat its wings or flap it swings
that's when it you know it has to give
energy to make the wings go back and
forth so it can
take off but when they're in the air and
they want to go down
it's very easy they don't have to use
any energy they just turn their wings
and they glide down through the air very
easy
very calm no energy needed
okay so to glide by to fly by floating
on the air you can glide too
if you get older and you want to hang
glide
hang glide that's uh pretty cool
hang glide that's where you go out with
a sports company right and they give you
a little
it's like a big kite and you hold on you
jump off a cliff
you don't fall but you glide down and
it's really cool
so maybe one day you can try that that
is to glide
okay our next word is to protect
now we saw before covering and
shell those are hard surfaces well
covering isn't always
doesn't have to be hard but a shell is a
hard surface
why do crabs have a shell because they
want
to be protected they want to protect
themselves from other animals
turtles also have a shell on their back
because they want to be protected
the shell protects them it keeps them
safe from damage you know other
creatures like
birds or dogs or wolves or whatever
might want to eat the turtle so the
turtle you know
can stick its head in and its legs and
its arms
and it's protected because it's a hard
shell nothing can get
inside the shell so the turtle is
safe okay our next word is
flying squirrel two words flying
squirrel so it's interesting like i said
before
not just birds can fly right we saw
bats bats can fly squirrels can fly too
although squirrels don't really flap
their wings
or beat their wings squirrels climb up
using their legs they'll climb up a tree
right and they'll climb up really high
in a tree
and if they look around they say oh i
want to go to that tree
they don't have to climb all the way
down and climb back up no
they just jump off the tree and they
spread their legs and they have like a
skin
covering and they can glide to the next
tree it's like their
own hang glider built in
to their body that's pretty cool huh so
flying squirrel is
an animal with a long tail that lives in
trees
and can glide just basically a squirrel
if you go walking
in the woods near your house i'm sure
you can see many squirrels
but these are special squirrels most
squirrels don't have
those wings or the covering but flying
squirrels do
they're kind of they're very interesting
animals okay
our next word is a grass hopper
that's an interesting right it's one
word but think about it it's like two
words
put together two words put together the
first word
is grass now you know grass
grass is the green plant the short plant
that grows
in a lawn maybe at your school or when
you're walking down the street
you see a nice area of green
right little blades of plant those
that's grass you can lay on the grass
it's
it's cool it's comfortable it smells
good right
and there's dirt underneath the grass
right so it's natural area
so we have grass and then we have
remember the word we just learned
hop to hop right but hop is a verb
a person who hops or a thing
that hops is a hopper
so if you hop you are a hopper
because you hop right if you walk you
are a
walker same idea right so er
means you know somebody who does
something at a restaurant
someone who waits waiter okay good
okay so a grasshopper is a thing that
hops
in the grass right if you look in the
grass you might see
grasshoppers they're little insects that
look like this
they're green so it's hard to see them
smart grasshopper right they have
long back legs look at these legs wow
they're so
long right those legs can can
extend like this very quickly and
so the insect the grasshopper can jump
really high
imagine if your legs were like that wow
you could play basketball really well
and you
dunk the basketball right that'd be
amazing but uh
maybe it's a good idea that we don't
have legs like that because maybe we
could
hit our head in in buildings right in
the classroom so
i don't know anyway an insect with long
back legs that can jump
very high that is a grasshopper okay so
very interesting words for this lesson i
hope you
hope you learned some good words there
we're going to use those in the reading
coming up next okay before we get into
the reading
let's talk about different types of
animals okay
now we have two classifications on the
top we have
animals with backbones and on the bottom
we have
animals without backbones so on the top
we see
many different types of animals with
backbones
and that's interesting and part of that
is interest
part of the interesting part about that
is that all these animals with backbones
share similar body design
what do i mean by that in other words
animals
that have backbones usually only have
four appendages like two arms and two
legs
you don't see animals with backbones
having six legs or like a dragon
two two wings and four legs right
that doesn't exist obviously our dragons
are not real
okay but animals with backbones there's
many types of animals with backbones
they diversified over a very long time
through evolution right they evolved
for different environments okay first of
all we have mammals
we are mammals right we are warm-blooded
right we ha we give birth to live
young babies right those are mammals
horses are mammals
dogs are mammals there are many types of
mammals
all mammals have backbones and we talked
about backbones before
what are backbones right also
who else has has backbones reptiles
reptiles are a class of creature
that are cold-blooded cold-blooded they
they don't adjust their body temperature
to the
outside temperature right they need the
sun to warm up that's why you see
lizards in the sun
they're using the sun's energy to warm
up and get energy
mammals don't need to do that and of
course reptiles also lay eggs they don't
give
birth to live young there are
one or two exceptions okay but usually
reptiles do not give
birth to live young then we have
amphibians
from a previous lesson we learned that
amphibians
are animals that live in the water and
on land
they can live on both environments but
they need water
to survive they can't live in the desert
for example
you don't see many frogs in the sahara
desert i'll see any frogs in the sarah
desert they can't survive they need
water
they live under they can live under
water they can live on land
there they use both environments to live
in
but they have backbones as well now
birds what are birds
birds are you could say are kind of
reptile they're actually descended
descended from dinosaurs
you know people say oh the dinosaurs are
extinct no more
actually that's not exactly true birds
are the babies the long distant babies
of reptiles not all reptiles died
a long long time ago some reptiles
survived
and their young evolved into the birds
we see today so imagine
imagine a a 10 foot tall
robin scary okay but that that's kind of
what maybe what the
what the dinosaurs a long long time ago
were like
now fish are in an in a separate class
by themselves right
they can they can breathe underwater
they do have backbones though and they
also have
bones that look like arms and legs but
you can't really see them because
they're in their
fins okay but they do have bones many
fish
do have bones in the structure not all
fish of course but many of them do
and all the all the animals with
backbones
also have ribs right bones that protect
the internal organs so mostly the same
design
a very similar design over all of these
different species
of animals now those are all animals
that we're familiar with they'll have
backbones
on the bottom of course we're also
familiar with insects
but have you really thought about the
body type of an
insect insects don't have backbones you
may be surprised to know that
animals actually insects don't really
have
bones at all they have
what we talked about before hard
coverings like a grasshopper has hard
coverings or
are sometimes it's soft sometimes it's
hard sometimes it's in between right
a little soft a little hard but these
provide
the structure for the body
of the insect if an animal didn't have a
backbone or bones
or it didn't have a hard covering to
give it structure
you know it would it wouldn't be able to
stand up right it wouldn't be able to
move it just kind of maybe
go from one place to another very very
it would be very difficult for it to
move
so um so animals uh insects have
hard coverings that help them move
around and also
that protect them okay so over here we
see a grasshopper right
we already talked about a grasshopper
but what is this bug here
what's the name of that bug a bug by the
way insect
we also say bug maybe you saw the movie
it's a bug's life bug is an informal
word
for insect and that's kind of like what
the name of this
insect is on the on the right hand side
we call that
a ladybug interesting name
but ladybugs are kind of cute right and
they have that very nice
pattern the red shell with the black
dots
and they fly away that shell kind of
separates and that's the wings actually
and
they can fly right they're a type of
beetle
okay so those are animals with backbones
and animals without backbones
so when we talk about insects you know
they're kind of interesting because they
don't have backbones
but they do have different parts and
again they have parts that
animals with backbones don't have right
like i said before animals with
backbones they all kind of follow the
same
structure the same pattern of body parts
but insects are different they have
different body parts
than we do we we don't have for example
antenna
have you ever seen a person with antenna
that's that'd be crazy wouldn't it
be pretty cool maybe also maybe the
movie you've seen a person with antenna
right okay but antenna what our antenna
and that's this word here antenna and
you can see
on the beetle here the antenna are here
right
those are the antenna and they're little
they're like little arms
really uh that stick out from the head
of the insect they're not
they're not as strong as arms right but
they're little um
appendages that stick out now antennae
are
very useful for insects they do many
things
they can help an insect feel right if
it's underground
there's no light you can't see so it can
feel its way oh there's a wall here
there's a wall there and it can feel its
way along the tunnel
it antennae the insect can taste
something oh is it good or is it
something i shouldn't eat
the some insects can hear through their
antenna right they pick up the
vibrations of sound
and they can hear and smell sometimes
you see
videos of ants right and two ants come
together and they're touching each other
with their antennae what they're doing
is they're smelling each other
and they're saying are do you belong to
my colony
my tribe or are you from a different
tribe are you a friend
or are you an enemy so insects will use
their antenna
to figure that out they can do many
things
with their antenna okay antenna are cool
huh
the next thing is a shell animals with
backbones don't have
shells right well i'm sorry some do like
a
turtle has a shell let's sorry about
that uh turtles do have shells and they
do have backbones
but many uh uh other animals that
don't have um backbones like a crab now
a crab is not an insect
let's make sure we know that a crab is
not an insect
but it does have a shell and it doesn't
have a backbone so the shell of a crab
helps keep the crab safe as we talked
about before
it protects the crap protects the crab
right and the crab doesn't have a
backbone but it needs
a shell to be able to move and you got
to be careful with the crabs right they
have those
pinchers those claws at the end
so be careful don't touch crabs don't
play with crabs
but crabs have very strong shells on
most other parts of the body they have
them on the pinchers on their arms on
their legs and on their back
and those help protect the crab from
danger
now over here we have another insect an
ant
an ant has six legs wow
crabs have many legs too one two three
four five a crab has this crab in the
picture has
ten legs right so animals without
backbones
have different patterns for their body
parts right
like i said before most animals with
backbones will follow the same pattern
two two arms maybe two legs or
four legs right like a dog but four
right it doesn't have six it doesn't
have eight
it has four but animals without
backbones
have different body patterns right
because they
changed they evolved a long time ago
they split off from animals with
backbones
so insects can have many legs think
about a
millipede or a centipede they're kind of
gross right but they have many legs and
they're
crawling around on the forest floor
okay so anyway six legs of an ant help
it climb on smooth or rough places if an
insect has
many legs it helps it to climb and to
grab onto things
think about a spider right a spider has
eight legs
right helps it to build the web and to
hold on to things
right okay so that's very interesting
different parts of animals without
backbones
okay well let's begin the reading
okay let's read the passage together and
we highlighted the
words from the vocabulary we can see how
they are used
in this reading passage to help us learn
more
about animals with and without backbones
so let's begin bones give
an animal its shape
they help an animal move
bones help to protect an
animal okay some animals have
backbones and some do not
mammals reptiles amphibians
birds and fish have
backbones we can say all of these
animals
have backbones
birds have wings and they can fly
a flying squirrel does not have wings
but it can glide like birds
some animals have hard coverings or
shells
not backbones
insects do not have backbones
they have hard coverings
the coverings help insects move
and protect them insects have
six legs they can climb
very well
many insects can hop a grasshopper can
hop a very long way
a grasshopper has wings it can
also fly
a crab does not have a backbone
it has a shell the shell protects it
a crab can swim like a fish
turtles are unusual animals
they have backbones and shells
right so sometimes it's hard to classify
animals
if you say turtles are unusual
that means un means not
right so they are not usual they are not
normal right they are unusual
animals they have backbones and they
have shells
right so there that's the thing about
nature though there's so many different
types of animals
and you think oh i classify all these
animals into this one group but wait
there's another animal that doesn't
quite fit or maybe he has
it's some sometimes he's like this
classification
but sometimes it's like this
classification so some animals
have like legs or arms in both
classifications and that's that's very
interesting
and that's what scientists biologists
are very interested
in okay let's go over the reading skill
for this lesson here and as we can see
from the reading passage
and from the ideas in this unit we are
comparing
and contrasting two different things
it's more of a contrast contrast is
how are things different right
how are things sorry different
how are things different and compare is
how are things the same
the same how are things the same how are
things
different did you notice something there
don't use the
with different but we do use the with
same how are things
the same how are things different
okay so uh we can see animals that
have backbones are different from
animals that don't have backbones so
we can also say that some of them are
alike or we can compare some things for
example
on the left hand side we can see how
some
animals are alike how are they the same
on the right hand side we can see how
animals some animals are different so
how are how are they the same
how are they different okay let's take a
look
so first we have uh under alike we see
fish and crabs can beep
okay so in the reading passage what did
it say
about fish and crabs it said that
both of them can do what
swim both of them can swim
in the water so that's how fish and
crabs are alike
that is how fish and crabs are the same
right in that way not always but in that
way
they are the same they can both swim but
they are also different because fish
have beep
crabs have shells well what is the whole
idea
of this unit we're talking about animals
that have backbones
and animals that don't have backbones
crabs have shells
and fish have backbones right so that's
our word there
backbones crabs don't have backbones
what am i doing sorry about that
back i was typing background because i
was
i was writing and thinking at the same
time oh speaking and writing
and that never works okay so back bones
fish have back bones not backgrounds
that's strange fish have backbones
crabs have shells okay that's how
they're different
so in some ways
things can be the same but in other ways
things those same things can be
different right
and that's true for almost everything
think about you
and your brother or your sister right in
some ways you're the same
in other ways you are different so we
can compare and contrast
almost anything right okay most human
beings though
are pretty much the same in many
important
ways that's a good thing to remember
okay good
okay coming down the next one where
we're comparing and contrasting
birds and grasshoppers so how are birds
and grasshoppers the same
well birds and grasshoppers both have
wings that's how they're the same right
and they can do what if an animal has
wings
what can it do it can fly
right fly you know let's make the f
obvious okay they can fly so birds and
grasshoppers have wings and they can fly
that's how they are the same but how are
they
different well birds have backbones
grasshoppers don't have backbones
grasshoppers have hard what remember the
word from the vocabulary
i think it was the second word
grasshoppers have hard
coverings
remember something that covers something
else in this case
it covers a covering is something that
covers
something else right so they have hard
coverings whether it's
a really tough skin or a shell they have
hard
coverings and grasshoppers they when
they
when it says they that means the last
thing that we talked about and that
would be grasshoppers so they refer back
to grasshoppers
they can beep a long way grasshoppers
have really long legs remember we talked
about that and when they extend those
legs what can they do
they can hop that's why they're called
grasshoppers because they can hop
they can hop a long way
right so grasshoppers can hop a long way
so like i said before we can compare and
contrast
animals or almost anything really and we
can say
how are they the same and how are they
different
okay so in this unit we can see very
interesting
uh features or types of different
animals
most animals that we know and are
familiar with have backbones right
mammals
fish amphibians reptiles
birds they all have backbones but of
course there's
many many many other types of animals
that we maybe we don't think about a lot
we just think oh they're they're like a
pestering us or we don't like them that
much like mosquitoes or
well spiders are good at good insects
but anyway we don't maybe we don't think
about them that often but they're
really different and they're very
amazing really
they have much different body parts than
other animals with backbones
so kind of interesting so in this lesson
we learned about types of animals that
have backbones
types of animals that don't have
backbones and we learned some words or
vocabulary
to describe the different parts of
animals especially
animals without backbones okay well i
hope you learned a lot this lesson
actually i did too
so a very interesting lesson it's very
cool to think about this type of
feature of science biology okay very
interesting part
of science okay well thanks for
listening with me
thanks for studying with me and we'll
see you next time take care bye bye
you

hello everybody
00:12
welcome back to american textbook
00:14
reading
00:15
i'm your host brian stewart today we're
00:18
looking at
00:19
book three lesson four and the title of
00:22
this lesson
00:23
is animals with and
00:26
without backbones
00:30
we'll talk about that shortly in this
00:33
lesson
00:34
you will discover names for body parts
00:38
and also how to classify
00:42
different types of animals
00:46
interesting let's get started okay
00:50
first of all like i said the title of
00:52
the unit is
00:54
animals with and without backbones
00:58
but what is a backbone
01:01
a backbone is the line of bones
01:05
down your back now don't be confused
01:08
about this
01:10
it looks like oh backbone is one bone
01:14
no the backbone is many different
01:17
smaller bones in in us in human beings
01:22
and most other animals they're little
01:24
discs
01:25
it's like a little disc and they stack
01:28
on top of each other
01:30
and it's a line of bones and they're all
01:32
connected with tissue
01:34
but these little bones it's kind of a
01:36
difficult word
01:38
let me spell it for you ver
01:44
bray so verta
01:48
bray vertebrae vertebrae that's a little
01:52
more of a difficult word more of a
01:55
scientific word maybe a medical word
01:59
most people just say backbone but it's
02:01
not one bone
02:02
it's many bones in fact in humans we
02:05
have
02:06
33 of these bones
02:09
33 vertebrae wow that's
02:12
many bones connected by tissue
02:16
in our back from our neck all the way to
02:19
our the bottom of our back so those are
02:22
vertebrae
02:22
that is the backbone and of course many
02:24
other bones
02:26
like your ribs come out from the
02:28
backbone
02:29
the backbone is very important for us
02:32
and many animals like us
02:36
but not all living things have backbones
02:39
we'll see that
02:40
okay continue next we have covering
02:43
now here's an animal i guess animal
02:46
insect
02:46
that does not have a backbone instead
02:50
it has a covering cover
02:53
to cover means to put on top of
02:55
something
02:56
when you get in bed at night you pull up
02:59
the cover right it covers you
03:02
some animals have a covering it's a hard
03:04
covering right
03:06
uh a covering is just a layer of
03:09
something
03:10
a layer of something over something else
03:13
like you
03:14
in your bed you have a covering a
03:16
blanket over you
03:17
it covers you it's a layer of blanket or
03:22
material cotton whatever over you when
03:24
you sleep
03:25
to keep you warm insects have a hard
03:28
covering
03:29
right that protects them they don't have
03:32
a backbone
03:33
okay next shell a
03:36
shell is a type of covering
03:40
think about a crab right um
03:43
don't get hungry okay but a shell the
03:46
hard outer covering of some animals
03:50
is a shell right you see crabs are very
03:53
tough
03:53
aren't they they've got the hard shell
03:56
on their back
03:57
what's another animal with a shell a
03:59
snail
04:00
right snails have shells
04:04
also they carry the covering
04:07
around on their back let's take a look
04:10
at a video
04:12
of an interesting crab
04:15
changing its shell okay let's take a
04:18
look at this this is what we call a
04:21
hermit crab right he backed into that
04:24
shell
04:25
he put it on his back and now he's got a
04:28
new home
04:29
sometimes you can see hermit crabs
04:33
hermit h-e-r-m-i-t
04:38
hermit crab a
04:42
hermit crab it grows but the shell
04:45
doesn't grow
04:46
so when the hermit crab gets too big he
04:49
can't
04:49
fit in his shell anymore what does he do
04:53
he gets out of his shell and finds a new
04:56
shell and then he has a new home okay
04:59
so very interesting hermit crabs are
05:01
very interesting
05:02
sometimes they're cute too right okay
05:06
next word is hop hop is a verb right
05:10
and maybe you play some games where you
05:12
hop
05:13
hop means to jump but not a long
05:16
jump a short jump like hop hop hop
05:19
right if you play hop scotch right
05:24
hop scotch
05:27
that's a game i'm sure you're familiar
05:30
with it
05:31
in america i think it has been a long
05:33
time since i played
05:35
hopscotch but usually people will have
05:39
a diagram like this right
05:42
and they will hop they'll hop in the
05:44
first square
05:45
then they'll hop in the second square
05:48
and they hop and they put
05:49
both legs here for this one and they hop
05:51
both legs here
05:52
so this one's kind of like that yeah
05:54
it's it's
05:56
called hopscotch and it's a game that
05:58
kids play and they hop
05:59
this little jumps from uh one
06:02
position to another and we can see a
06:05
video of
06:06
something hopping look at this bird uh
06:09
it's going to hop right it's moving
06:12
around
06:12
now see how it hops it doesn't walk
06:15
right it
06:16
hops right it goes from place to place
06:20
by hopping birds don't walk very well
06:22
their bodies aren't built to walk
06:25
but they can hop very well and of course
06:27
they can fly very well too
06:29
so that is to hop okay
06:34
now birds can also glide and some other
06:36
not just birds but
06:38
mammals this is a bat okay and
06:41
animals with wings can
06:44
glide glide means to fly
06:48
by floating on the air right so
06:52
in other words the bat or the bird
06:54
doesn't have to
06:56
uh beat its wings it doesn't have to
07:00
beat or
07:02
flap sometimes you could say flap
07:05
it's wings
07:10
right beat its wings or flap it swings
07:12
that's when it you know it has to give
07:13
energy to make the wings go back and
07:15
forth so it can
07:17
take off but when they're in the air and
07:19
they want to go down
07:20
it's very easy they don't have to use
07:23
any energy they just turn their wings
07:25
and they glide down through the air very
07:27
easy
07:28
very calm no energy needed
07:31
okay so to glide by to fly by floating
07:35
on the air you can glide too
07:38
if you get older and you want to hang
07:41
glide
07:42
hang glide that's uh pretty cool
07:45
hang glide that's where you go out with
07:49
a sports company right and they give you
07:50
a little
07:52
it's like a big kite and you hold on you
07:54
jump off a cliff
07:56
you don't fall but you glide down and
07:59
it's really cool
08:00
so maybe one day you can try that that
08:03
is to glide
08:04
okay our next word is to protect
08:08
now we saw before covering and
08:11
shell those are hard surfaces well
08:14
covering isn't always
08:15
doesn't have to be hard but a shell is a
08:17
hard surface
08:18
why do crabs have a shell because they
08:21
want
08:22
to be protected they want to protect
08:26
themselves from other animals
08:29
turtles also have a shell on their back
08:33
because they want to be protected
08:36
the shell protects them it keeps them
08:39
safe from damage you know other
08:42
creatures like
08:43
birds or dogs or wolves or whatever
08:47
might want to eat the turtle so the
08:49
turtle you know
08:50
can stick its head in and its legs and
08:53
its arms
08:54
and it's protected because it's a hard
08:56
shell nothing can get
08:58
inside the shell so the turtle is
09:01
safe okay our next word is
09:05
flying squirrel two words flying
09:08
squirrel so it's interesting like i said
09:11
before
09:12
not just birds can fly right we saw
09:15
bats bats can fly squirrels can fly too
09:19
although squirrels don't really flap
09:21
their wings
09:22
or beat their wings squirrels climb up
09:26
using their legs they'll climb up a tree
09:28
right and they'll climb up really high
09:30
in a tree
09:31
and if they look around they say oh i
09:32
want to go to that tree
09:34
they don't have to climb all the way
09:36
down and climb back up no
09:37
they just jump off the tree and they
09:41
spread their legs and they have like a
09:43
skin
09:44
covering and they can glide to the next
09:47
tree it's like their
09:48
own hang glider built in
09:51
to their body that's pretty cool huh so
09:54
flying squirrel is
09:56
an animal with a long tail that lives in
09:59
trees
10:00
and can glide just basically a squirrel
10:03
if you go walking
10:04
in the woods near your house i'm sure
10:06
you can see many squirrels
10:07
but these are special squirrels most
10:10
squirrels don't have
10:11
those wings or the covering but flying
10:14
squirrels do
10:16
they're kind of they're very interesting
10:17
animals okay
10:20
our next word is a grass hopper
10:23
that's an interesting right it's one
10:25
word but think about it it's like two
10:27
words
10:27
put together two words put together the
10:30
first word
10:31
is grass now you know grass
10:34
grass is the green plant the short plant
10:37
that grows
10:38
in a lawn maybe at your school or when
10:41
you're walking down the street
10:42
you see a nice area of green
10:46
right little blades of plant those
10:49
that's grass you can lay on the grass
10:51
it's
10:51
it's cool it's comfortable it smells
10:54
good right
10:55
and there's dirt underneath the grass
10:57
right so it's natural area
10:59
so we have grass and then we have
11:00
remember the word we just learned
11:02
hop to hop right but hop is a verb
11:07
a person who hops or a thing
11:10
that hops is a hopper
11:13
so if you hop you are a hopper
11:17
because you hop right if you walk you
11:20
are a
11:21
walker same idea right so er
11:24
means you know somebody who does
11:26
something at a restaurant
11:28
someone who waits waiter okay good
11:31
okay so a grasshopper is a thing that
11:34
hops
11:34
in the grass right if you look in the
11:36
grass you might see
11:38
grasshoppers they're little insects that
11:41
look like this
11:42
they're green so it's hard to see them
11:45
smart grasshopper right they have
11:48
long back legs look at these legs wow
11:52
they're so
11:52
long right those legs can can
11:57
extend like this very quickly and
12:00
so the insect the grasshopper can jump
12:03
really high
12:04
imagine if your legs were like that wow
12:08
you could play basketball really well
12:10
and you
12:11
dunk the basketball right that'd be
12:13
amazing but uh
12:14
maybe it's a good idea that we don't
12:16
have legs like that because maybe we
12:18
could
12:18
hit our head in in buildings right in
12:20
the classroom so
12:21
i don't know anyway an insect with long
12:24
back legs that can jump
12:25
very high that is a grasshopper okay so
12:29
very interesting words for this lesson i
12:31
hope you
12:32
hope you learned some good words there
12:34
we're going to use those in the reading
12:36
coming up next okay before we get into
12:40
the reading
12:41
let's talk about different types of
12:43
animals okay
12:44
now we have two classifications on the
12:47
top we have
12:48
animals with backbones and on the bottom
12:51
we have
12:51
animals without backbones so on the top
12:55
we see
12:55
many different types of animals with
12:58
backbones
12:59
and that's interesting and part of that
13:02
is interest
13:02
part of the interesting part about that
13:05
is that all these animals with backbones
13:08
share similar body design
13:11
what do i mean by that in other words
13:13
animals
13:14
that have backbones usually only have
13:17
four appendages like two arms and two
13:20
legs
13:21
you don't see animals with backbones
13:24
having six legs or like a dragon
13:26
two two wings and four legs right
13:30
that doesn't exist obviously our dragons
13:32
are not real
13:33
okay but animals with backbones there's
13:36
many types of animals with backbones
13:38
they diversified over a very long time
13:41
through evolution right they evolved
13:43
for different environments okay first of
13:47
all we have mammals
13:48
we are mammals right we are warm-blooded
13:52
right we ha we give birth to live
13:55
young babies right those are mammals
13:57
horses are mammals
13:59
dogs are mammals there are many types of
14:01
mammals
14:02
all mammals have backbones and we talked
14:05
about backbones before
14:06
what are backbones right also
14:10
who else has has backbones reptiles
14:13
reptiles are a class of creature
14:15
that are cold-blooded cold-blooded they
14:18
they don't adjust their body temperature
14:21
to the
14:21
outside temperature right they need the
14:24
sun to warm up that's why you see
14:26
lizards in the sun
14:27
they're using the sun's energy to warm
14:29
up and get energy
14:31
mammals don't need to do that and of
14:33
course reptiles also lay eggs they don't
14:35
give
14:36
birth to live young there are
14:39
one or two exceptions okay but usually
14:41
reptiles do not give
14:43
birth to live young then we have
14:46
amphibians
14:47
from a previous lesson we learned that
14:49
amphibians
14:50
are animals that live in the water and
14:53
on land
14:54
they can live on both environments but
14:56
they need water
14:57
to survive they can't live in the desert
15:00
for example
15:01
you don't see many frogs in the sahara
15:03
desert i'll see any frogs in the sarah
15:05
desert they can't survive they need
15:07
water
15:07
they live under they can live under
15:09
water they can live on land
15:11
there they use both environments to live
15:14
in
15:14
but they have backbones as well now
15:17
birds what are birds
15:19
birds are you could say are kind of
15:20
reptile they're actually descended
15:23
descended from dinosaurs
15:26
you know people say oh the dinosaurs are
15:28
extinct no more
15:30
actually that's not exactly true birds
15:34
are the babies the long distant babies
15:37
of reptiles not all reptiles died
15:41
a long long time ago some reptiles
15:44
survived
15:45
and their young evolved into the birds
15:48
we see today so imagine
15:51
imagine a a 10 foot tall
15:54
robin scary okay but that that's kind of
15:58
what maybe what the
15:59
what the dinosaurs a long long time ago
16:02
were like
16:03
now fish are in an in a separate class
16:05
by themselves right
16:07
they can they can breathe underwater
16:10
they do have backbones though and they
16:12
also have
16:14
bones that look like arms and legs but
16:17
you can't really see them because
16:19
they're in their
16:20
fins okay but they do have bones many
16:23
fish
16:23
do have bones in the structure not all
16:25
fish of course but many of them do
16:27
and all the all the animals with
16:30
backbones
16:31
also have ribs right bones that protect
16:34
the internal organs so mostly the same
16:37
design
16:38
a very similar design over all of these
16:41
different species
16:42
of animals now those are all animals
16:46
that we're familiar with they'll have
16:48
backbones
16:48
on the bottom of course we're also
16:50
familiar with insects
16:52
but have you really thought about the
16:54
body type of an
16:55
insect insects don't have backbones you
16:59
may be surprised to know that
17:01
animals actually insects don't really
17:04
have
17:04
bones at all they have
17:08
what we talked about before hard
17:10
coverings like a grasshopper has hard
17:12
coverings or
17:13
are sometimes it's soft sometimes it's
17:15
hard sometimes it's in between right
17:18
a little soft a little hard but these
17:20
provide
17:21
the structure for the body
17:24
of the insect if an animal didn't have a
17:27
backbone or bones
17:29
or it didn't have a hard covering to
17:31
give it structure
17:32
you know it would it wouldn't be able to
17:34
stand up right it wouldn't be able to
17:35
move it just kind of maybe
17:37
go from one place to another very very
17:39
it would be very difficult for it to
17:41
move
17:42
so um so animals uh insects have
17:46
hard coverings that help them move
17:48
around and also
17:49
that protect them okay so over here we
17:52
see a grasshopper right
17:54
we already talked about a grasshopper
17:55
but what is this bug here
17:57
what's the name of that bug a bug by the
18:00
way insect
18:01
we also say bug maybe you saw the movie
18:05
it's a bug's life bug is an informal
18:08
word
18:09
for insect and that's kind of like what
18:12
the name of this
18:13
insect is on the on the right hand side
18:16
we call that
18:17
a ladybug interesting name
18:21
but ladybugs are kind of cute right and
18:23
they have that very nice
18:25
pattern the red shell with the black
18:27
dots
18:28
and they fly away that shell kind of
18:31
separates and that's the wings actually
18:33
and
18:33
they can fly right they're a type of
18:35
beetle
18:36
okay so those are animals with backbones
18:39
and animals without backbones
18:41
so when we talk about insects you know
18:43
they're kind of interesting because they
18:45
don't have backbones
18:46
but they do have different parts and
18:49
again they have parts that
18:50
animals with backbones don't have right
18:54
like i said before animals with
18:55
backbones they all kind of follow the
18:57
same
18:58
structure the same pattern of body parts
19:01
but insects are different they have
19:03
different body parts
19:04
than we do we we don't have for example
19:07
antenna
19:08
have you ever seen a person with antenna
19:10
that's that'd be crazy wouldn't it
19:12
be pretty cool maybe also maybe the
19:14
movie you've seen a person with antenna
19:17
right okay but antenna what our antenna
19:20
and that's this word here antenna and
19:23
you can see
19:24
on the beetle here the antenna are here
19:26
right
19:27
those are the antenna and they're little
19:30
they're like little arms
19:31
really uh that stick out from the head
19:34
of the insect they're not
19:35
they're not as strong as arms right but
19:37
they're little um
19:39
appendages that stick out now antennae
19:42
are
19:42
very useful for insects they do many
19:45
things
19:46
they can help an insect feel right if
19:48
it's underground
19:50
there's no light you can't see so it can
19:52
feel its way oh there's a wall here
19:54
there's a wall there and it can feel its
19:56
way along the tunnel
19:58
it antennae the insect can taste
20:01
something oh is it good or is it
20:02
something i shouldn't eat
20:05
the some insects can hear through their
20:07
antenna right they pick up the
20:08
vibrations of sound
20:10
and they can hear and smell sometimes
20:13
you see
20:13
videos of ants right and two ants come
20:16
together and they're touching each other
20:18
with their antennae what they're doing
20:20
is they're smelling each other
20:22
and they're saying are do you belong to
20:24
my colony
20:25
my tribe or are you from a different
20:27
tribe are you a friend
20:29
or are you an enemy so insects will use
20:32
their antenna
20:33
to figure that out they can do many
20:35
things
20:36
with their antenna okay antenna are cool
20:39
huh
20:40
the next thing is a shell animals with
20:43
backbones don't have
20:44
shells right well i'm sorry some do like
20:47
a
20:48
turtle has a shell let's sorry about
20:50
that uh turtles do have shells and they
20:52
do have backbones
20:53
but many uh uh other animals that
20:57
don't have um backbones like a crab now
21:00
a crab is not an insect
21:02
let's make sure we know that a crab is
21:04
not an insect
21:05
but it does have a shell and it doesn't
21:07
have a backbone so the shell of a crab
21:10
helps keep the crab safe as we talked
21:12
about before
21:13
it protects the crap protects the crab
21:16
right and the crab doesn't have a
21:18
backbone but it needs
21:20
a shell to be able to move and you got
21:22
to be careful with the crabs right they
21:23
have those
21:24
pinchers those claws at the end
21:27
so be careful don't touch crabs don't
21:29
play with crabs
21:32
but crabs have very strong shells on
21:35
most other parts of the body they have
21:36
them on the pinchers on their arms on
21:38
their legs and on their back
21:40
and those help protect the crab from
21:42
danger
21:44
now over here we have another insect an
21:47
ant
21:47
an ant has six legs wow
21:52
crabs have many legs too one two three
21:55
four five a crab has this crab in the
21:57
picture has
21:58
ten legs right so animals without
22:00
backbones
22:02
have different patterns for their body
22:05
parts right
22:06
like i said before most animals with
22:08
backbones will follow the same pattern
22:10
two two arms maybe two legs or
22:14
four legs right like a dog but four
22:16
right it doesn't have six it doesn't
22:18
have eight
22:19
it has four but animals without
22:22
backbones
22:23
have different body patterns right
22:25
because they
22:26
changed they evolved a long time ago
22:29
they split off from animals with
22:31
backbones
22:32
so insects can have many legs think
22:34
about a
22:35
millipede or a centipede they're kind of
22:38
gross right but they have many legs and
22:40
they're
22:40
crawling around on the forest floor
22:43
okay so anyway six legs of an ant help
22:46
it climb on smooth or rough places if an
22:49
insect has
22:49
many legs it helps it to climb and to
22:52
grab onto things
22:54
think about a spider right a spider has
22:56
eight legs
22:57
right helps it to build the web and to
22:59
hold on to things
23:00
right okay so that's very interesting
23:04
different parts of animals without
23:06
backbones
23:07
okay well let's begin the reading
23:14
okay let's read the passage together and
23:17
we highlighted the
23:18
words from the vocabulary we can see how
23:20
they are used
23:22
in this reading passage to help us learn
23:25
more
23:25
about animals with and without backbones
23:29
so let's begin bones give
23:32
an animal its shape
23:35
they help an animal move
23:39
bones help to protect an
23:42
animal okay some animals have
23:46
backbones and some do not
23:50
mammals reptiles amphibians
23:53
birds and fish have
23:56
backbones we can say all of these
24:00
animals
24:00
have backbones
24:04
birds have wings and they can fly
24:09
a flying squirrel does not have wings
24:12
but it can glide like birds
24:17
some animals have hard coverings or
24:20
shells
24:21
not backbones
24:26
insects do not have backbones
24:29
they have hard coverings
24:33
the coverings help insects move
24:36
and protect them insects have
24:40
six legs they can climb
24:43
very well
24:47
many insects can hop a grasshopper can
24:51
hop a very long way
24:55
a grasshopper has wings it can
24:58
also fly
25:02
a crab does not have a backbone
25:06
it has a shell the shell protects it
25:11
a crab can swim like a fish
25:15
turtles are unusual animals
25:20
they have backbones and shells
25:23
right so sometimes it's hard to classify
25:26
animals
25:27
if you say turtles are unusual
25:30
that means un means not
25:33
right so they are not usual they are not
25:36
normal right they are unusual
25:40
animals they have backbones and they
25:42
have shells
25:43
right so there that's the thing about
25:45
nature though there's so many different
25:47
types of animals
25:49
and you think oh i classify all these
25:50
animals into this one group but wait
25:52
there's another animal that doesn't
25:54
quite fit or maybe he has
25:55
it's some sometimes he's like this
25:58
classification
25:59
but sometimes it's like this
26:01
classification so some animals
26:03
have like legs or arms in both
26:07
classifications and that's that's very
26:10
interesting
26:10
and that's what scientists biologists
26:13
are very interested
26:14
in okay let's go over the reading skill
26:17
for this lesson here and as we can see
26:20
from the reading passage
26:22
and from the ideas in this unit we are
26:24
comparing
26:26
and contrasting two different things
26:30
it's more of a contrast contrast is
26:33
how are things different right
26:36
how are things sorry different
26:41
how are things different and compare is
26:45
how are things the same
26:48
the same how are things the same how are
26:52
things
26:53
different did you notice something there
26:55
don't use the
26:56
with different but we do use the with
26:59
same how are things
27:01
the same how are things different
27:04
okay so uh we can see animals that
27:08
have backbones are different from
27:12
animals that don't have backbones so
27:15
we can also say that some of them are
27:17
alike or we can compare some things for
27:20
example
27:21
on the left hand side we can see how
27:23
some
27:24
animals are alike how are they the same
27:27
on the right hand side we can see how
27:30
animals some animals are different so
27:33
how are how are they the same
27:36
how are they different okay let's take a
27:39
look
27:40
so first we have uh under alike we see
27:43
fish and crabs can beep
27:46
okay so in the reading passage what did
27:49
it say
27:50
about fish and crabs it said that
27:53
both of them can do what
27:56
swim both of them can swim
27:59
in the water so that's how fish and
28:02
crabs are alike
28:03
that is how fish and crabs are the same
28:07
right in that way not always but in that
28:11
way
28:11
they are the same they can both swim but
28:15
they are also different because fish
28:17
have beep
28:18
crabs have shells well what is the whole
28:21
idea
28:21
of this unit we're talking about animals
28:24
that have backbones
28:25
and animals that don't have backbones
28:27
crabs have shells
28:30
and fish have backbones right so that's
28:34
our word there
28:35
backbones crabs don't have backbones
28:38
what am i doing sorry about that
28:42
back i was typing background because i
28:45
was
28:45
i was writing and thinking at the same
28:47
time oh speaking and writing
28:49
and that never works okay so back bones
28:54
fish have back bones not backgrounds
28:56
that's strange fish have backbones
29:00
crabs have shells okay that's how
29:03
they're different
29:04
so in some ways
29:07
things can be the same but in other ways
29:11
things those same things can be
29:13
different right
29:15
and that's true for almost everything
29:17
think about you
29:18
and your brother or your sister right in
29:21
some ways you're the same
29:22
in other ways you are different so we
29:25
can compare and contrast
29:27
almost anything right okay most human
29:30
beings though
29:31
are pretty much the same in many
29:34
important
29:35
ways that's a good thing to remember
29:37
okay good
29:38
okay coming down the next one where
29:40
we're comparing and contrasting
29:42
birds and grasshoppers so how are birds
29:46
and grasshoppers the same
29:48
well birds and grasshoppers both have
29:50
wings that's how they're the same right
29:52
and they can do what if an animal has
29:55
wings
29:55
what can it do it can fly
29:59
right fly you know let's make the f
30:03
obvious okay they can fly so birds and
30:06
grasshoppers have wings and they can fly
30:09
that's how they are the same but how are
30:12
they
30:12
different well birds have backbones
30:17
grasshoppers don't have backbones
30:19
grasshoppers have hard what remember the
30:21
word from the vocabulary
30:23
i think it was the second word
30:25
grasshoppers have hard
30:30
coverings
30:31
remember something that covers something
30:34
else in this case
30:35
it covers a covering is something that
30:38
covers
30:39
something else right so they have hard
30:41
coverings whether it's
30:42
a really tough skin or a shell they have
30:45
hard
30:45
coverings and grasshoppers they when
30:49
they
30:49
when it says they that means the last
30:52
thing that we talked about and that
30:54
would be grasshoppers so they refer back
30:56
to grasshoppers
30:58
they can beep a long way grasshoppers
31:02
have really long legs remember we talked
31:04
about that and when they extend those
31:06
legs what can they do
31:07
they can hop that's why they're called
31:09
grasshoppers because they can hop
31:12
they can hop a long way
31:16
right so grasshoppers can hop a long way
31:20
so like i said before we can compare and
31:23
contrast
31:23
animals or almost anything really and we
31:26
can say
31:27
how are they the same and how are they
31:30
different
31:30
okay so in this unit we can see very
31:33
interesting
31:34
uh features or types of different
31:38
animals
31:39
most animals that we know and are
31:40
familiar with have backbones right
31:43
mammals
31:43
fish amphibians reptiles
31:47
birds they all have backbones but of
31:49
course there's
31:50
many many many other types of animals
31:53
that we maybe we don't think about a lot
31:55
we just think oh they're they're like a
31:57
pestering us or we don't like them that
31:59
much like mosquitoes or
32:01
well spiders are good at good insects
32:03
but anyway we don't maybe we don't think
32:05
about them that often but they're
32:07
really different and they're very
32:09
amazing really
32:10
they have much different body parts than
32:12
other animals with backbones
32:14
so kind of interesting so in this lesson
32:17
we learned about types of animals that
32:18
have backbones
32:19
types of animals that don't have
32:21
backbones and we learned some words or
32:23
vocabulary
32:24
to describe the different parts of
32:26
animals especially
32:28
animals without backbones okay well i
32:31
hope you learned a lot this lesson
32:32
actually i did too
32:34
so a very interesting lesson it's very
32:36
cool to think about this type of
32:39
feature of science biology okay very
32:41
interesting part
32:42
of science okay well thanks for
32:44
listening with me
32:46
thanks for studying with me and we'll
32:47
see you next time take care bye bye
32:56
you
