to educate somebody right now you are

you
when you go to school you are being
educated by your teachers and your
textbooks
when you go to the library and you read
a book you're being educated
it's very important to continue
to be educated throughout our lives even
after you finish
school read books that you're interested
in and subjects that you're interested
in
watch uh documentaries on television or
watch
movies about history and always don't
give up being educated right education
is very important
six more than what is useful or needed
more than what is useful or needed is
extra if you have something that you
don't need
right you don't need it it's more than
what is useful
you don't need it for uh for using it
it's not
it's not something that you that you
need to use it's just something
extra right something above
and uh beyond what you need or what is
useful
it's extra usually it's a bonus we think
of it in in the terms of
positive thinking right so dessert after
dinner
is something extra for you to eat you
don't need it
maybe it's not useful but you like it
right that's
extra okay sometimes your mom will put
something extra in your lunch when you
go to school
or you'll get something extra from your
friends if they give you something you
don't need it
maybe it's not useful but it's something
that you like it's extra
seven a place to keep animals for people
to see
so these people are visiting what
they're visiting the zoo
the giraffe lives in the zoo well this
giraffe lives in the zoo most giraffes
live in the wild
right but in some many cities there are
zoos where people can go and they can
see
animals these animals are not tame
they're not
pets they're they're kind of wild
animals even though they don't live in
nature they live in a
a place that's built by human beings
they are in a zoo but they are not tame
you have to be careful
when approaching these animals because
they're maybe not used to being around
human beings
okay we say that of course that's a zoo
i forgot the the word
zoo when you say this word pronunciation
zee zoo
zoo not jew zoo
zs you get some vibration so make your
mouth
wide like that and make your tongue
vibrate zoo
and you got it zoo okay next one whoa
this kid's really smart right unique and
different
right most kids most children do not
write these types of diagrams you have
to be very smart and very
intelligent to be able to do this we say
this person is special some kids some
young
people are very smart they're like
geniuses
and they are able to do these types of
things at an
early age maybe even better than people
who are a lot older than them
some of them are a lot smarter than
their teachers in school
they are special kids and they should
have special education
okay next one nine wow very nice and
peaceful
very beautiful scene having a lot of
water
in the air now having a lot of water in
the air it's kind of hard to show a
picture of that but basically if you're
at the beach
you notice you're next to the ocean it's
very hot
uh when it's hot a lot of the water
comes into the air
right and in korean you say
right in english we say it's human
during the summer time
in korea it's very humid isn't it
and you sweat a lot in this in the
wintertime it's
dry so the opposite of humid the
opposite
pandero is dry it's dry in the winter
but humid in the summer humid means
it has a lot of water in the air next
one
people who make sure we follow the laws
who are
people that make sure we follow the laws
we call these people
police this person is a police man
but there are also police women
okay if you just want to make you talk
about police you can say just say police
you know it doesn't mean man or woman
it's just the police and usually we say
the police
force it's a group of people men and
women
who make sure we follow the laws they
enforce the law
if he is breaking the law by speeding
going too fast
or if he doesn't stop at the stoplight
or stop sign
then this person will write a ticket
making sure that he
follows the law next time 11.
oh we have a plan they're playing doctor
right he's going to be the doctor for
his younger brother looks like what a
thing does
or is used for but what a thing does or
is used for
we call that a roll right
so what is the role of the things that
you use for example the mask what's the
role of the mask
the role of the mask or the function of
the mask is to prevent
disease from transferring from one
person to another
so what the thing does or what it is
used for we can say
what's its role you could also say what
is it
what is its function
what is its function or what is it used
for
what is it used for
what's its role okay whoa that was fast
these kids have you ever done this what
are they doing there they have pillows
and they're fighting with each other to
try to beat somebody you fight them
of course a pillow fight is
very common among brothers and sisters
and friends right
hey you're fighting somebody but you
don't mean to hurt them you're just
having fun
you're trying to beat the other person
and you're fighting them
of course we also fight people in video
games try
don't fight people physically that's not
good behavior
but you're trying to beat the other
person now fight is an
irregular verb it has different forms
when we use it
in past tense so we say fight fought
fought fight fought fought okay
that's the different verb forms
depending on the
verb tense that you're using present or
past tense with the simple past or past
perfect
okay next one 13. this house looks
terrible right it's leaning to one side
situation or environment the condition
of this house is very bad in fact
this house should be torn down it's not
safe
the condition is unsafe what is the
condition of this house
dangerous unsafe it should be torn down
and a new house should be built a new
house the condition is very good
and the condition is safe okay so the
situation environment
is like the condition okay next one
made of hardened sand and stone made of
hardened sand and stone
what is this this is concrete okay so
you see this truck sometimes
you see these trucks at kong su
jung kang sites right and that's
construction site
and they use concrete to build buildings
or other types of things roads walls
concrete is used for a lot of different
things and they use sand
and stone crushed up stone water also
and they can make concrete okay made of
hardened
sand and stone concrete this isn't hard
this is wet
but after it dries it becomes hard and
it's a very strong
building material okay number 15
a huge field with grass and few
trees so a huge field
lots of grass a few trees here and there
we call this place a plane a plane
and if you talk about the planes usually
people say the planes
like if they say the great plains the
great plains is a
is an area designated in the middle of
america
it involves states like texas oklahoma
nebraska
uh and higher up the dakotas um
these states they're not a lot of trees
it's just very flat
and lots of grass and there's a lot of
farmland there now a long time ago it's
just grass and buffalo
would run up and down this area and the
indians would hunt the buffalo
those were the great plains okay so
plain
a very flat area huge field you can see
from miles and miles and miles
it takes days to go across the great
plains
okay last word a deep hole if you have a
deep hole like this this looks like a
mining operation
but a deep hole we call it a pit i used
to work for a mining company
in america i was in the human resources
department at a large mining company
and that's what we call we call it the
pit we say the north pit the south pit
right so a pit is a deep hole but pit
doesn't just mean mining
it can be a natural pit for example
sometimes you hear on the news
where the ground just opens up and they
call that a sinkhole
but it's also you can also say it's a
pit it's just a deep hole
in the ground it's a pit okay that's our
words
let's go over the words how well do we
remember these words let's do some
exercises
number one i enjoy movies they are great
beep
and then we have the words here so we
have a waste
be audience c entertainment
d people what did we say about this word
we said that
something that you do for fun
right like a movie it could be playing a
video game
it could be playing soccer there's many
forms of it what is it
of course we talked about entertainment
i enjoy movies
they are great entertainment not waste
that doesn't make sense
not audience that doesn't make sense and
not people
movies are not people that's weird
movies are a form
of entertainment there are many types of
entertainment
there are many forms of entertainment
movies
are one type of entertainment
okay skipping number two going to three
you can see
monkeys in cages at the what
where can you go and see animals in
cages hopefully not in cages that's not
very nice that's not very good
hopefully they're in open areas but
sometimes they're in large cages
okay where do you see them and the
planes in the jungle
at the zoo or in the at the environment
right notice we say at that's important
too
because we don't say at the planes we
say on the plains
we don't say at the jungle we say in the
jungle let me write this down for you
on the plains in
the oops in the jungle at
the zoo and in
the environment so really we see at here
at is here so that kind of gives us the
idea anyway
right you can see monkeys in cages at
the zoo
we say at the zoo we don't you can say
in the zoo but
it's more common to say at the zoo but
we don't say at the planes we say
on the planes we don't say at the jungle
we say
in the jungle and environment is usually
common to say
in the environment in an environment
so just looking at the preposition zoo
is the only one that we have to choose
so zoo is the answer
but zoo is also the only one that makes
sense you don't see monkeys in cages on
the plains or
in the jungle the jungle is a natural
environment
you don't have cages in the jungle where
monkeys live
that's crazy and in the enviro in the
environment that doesn't
fit well with the sentence anyway the
best answer is zoo even if we don't
worry about the preposition
okay next one number five i was beep
at a good school what are what is done
to you at a school
not nothing bad that sounds about what
it's done to you at a school
but in a positive sense what happens to
you
at school right are you educated
are you entertained are you kept are you
treated
well you could be all four of those
things but one of those is the
best choice i was educated
at a good school hopefully you are
if it's a good school you will get a
good education
so you will be educated at a good school
i was
educated at a good school you could say
i was
entertained at a good school but
the purpose for going to school is not
to be entertained
the purpose for going to school is to be
educated
so that's not a very good fit i was kept
at a good school this sounds like you
were kept a prisoner at a good school
that sounds a little strange
it's possible grammatically but it
sounds strange
i was treated at a good school and that
sounds odd too
because that doesn't say anything you
were treated at a good school
usually we have to say i was treated
well or was treated poorly
right how were you treated if you just
say i was treated at a good school that
doesn't say anything
what does it say and so it doesn't fit
the best answer is educated i was
educated at a good school it means i got
a good education
seven my dog is beep he has two
different colored
eyes well that's strange if your dog has
one blue eye and one brown eye that's
kind of strange right
so would you say your dog is poor your
dog is special
your dog is small or your dog is old
okay well strange can be unusual
right it can be uh different
it can be special not ordinary right
so the only one is that fits is special
pore doesn't fit my dog is poor
doesn't have any money dogs don't care
about that my dog is small
okay your dog is small but why would you
say he has two different colored eyes
that's not an example of being small
my dog is old okay well he's old but why
would you say is two different colored
eyes
having two different colored eyes is not
an example of being old
but having two different colored eyes is
an example of being special
so make sure that this adjective fits
the
explanation or the example right if this
example does not fit the adjective
it's not a good match it's not a good
connection so special is the best choice
here
because you're saying the first sentence
and then you're giving an example of
that
okay so always make sure you have that
connection when you're filling in
exercises like this okay that wraps up
the vocabulary section
now let's take a short break and go into
the reading
part let's take a break
you

08:16
peaceful
08:17
very beautiful scene having a lot of
08:20
water
08:21
in the air now having a lot of water in
08:24
the air it's kind of hard to show a
08:25
picture of that but basically if you're
08:26
at the beach
08:27
you notice you're next to the ocean it's
08:30
very hot
08:31
uh when it's hot a lot of the water
08:34
comes into the air
08:35
right and in korean you say
08:38
right in english we say it's human
08:41
during the summer time
08:43
in korea it's very humid isn't it
08:46
and you sweat a lot in this in the
08:49
wintertime it's
08:50
dry so the opposite of humid the
08:53
opposite
08:53
pandero is dry it's dry in the winter
08:57
but humid in the summer humid means
09:00
it has a lot of water in the air next
09:03
one
09:04
people who make sure we follow the laws
09:07
who are
09:08
people that make sure we follow the laws
09:09
we call these people
09:11
police this person is a police man
09:14
but there are also police women
09:18
okay if you just want to make you talk
09:20
about police you can say just say police
09:22
you know it doesn't mean man or woman
09:23
it's just the police and usually we say
09:26
the police
09:27
force it's a group of people men and
09:29
women
09:30
who make sure we follow the laws they
09:34
enforce the law
09:35
if he is breaking the law by speeding
09:38
going too fast
09:39
or if he doesn't stop at the stoplight
09:42
or stop sign
09:43
then this person will write a ticket
09:46
making sure that he
09:47
follows the law next time 11.
09:51
oh we have a plan they're playing doctor
09:54
right he's going to be the doctor for
09:56
his younger brother looks like what a
09:58
thing does
09:59
or is used for but what a thing does or
10:02
is used for
10:03
we call that a roll right
10:07
so what is the role of the things that
10:10
you use for example the mask what's the
10:12
role of the mask
10:13
the role of the mask or the function of
10:15
the mask is to prevent
10:18
disease from transferring from one
10:20
person to another
10:21
so what the thing does or what it is
10:23
used for we can say
10:24
what's its role you could also say what
10:27
is it
10:28
what is its function
10:32
what is its function or what is it used
10:35
for
10:36
what is it used for
10:39
what's its role okay whoa that was fast
10:44
these kids have you ever done this what
10:45
are they doing there they have pillows
10:47
and they're fighting with each other to
10:49
try to beat somebody you fight them
10:51
of course a pillow fight is
10:55
very common among brothers and sisters
10:58
and friends right
11:00
hey you're fighting somebody but you
11:01
don't mean to hurt them you're just
11:03
having fun
11:04
you're trying to beat the other person
11:06
and you're fighting them
11:07
of course we also fight people in video
11:10
games try
11:10
don't fight people physically that's not
11:13
good behavior
11:14
but you're trying to beat the other
11:15
person now fight is an
11:17
irregular verb it has different forms
11:20
when we use it
11:20
in past tense so we say fight fought
11:25
fought fight fought fought okay
11:28
that's the different verb forms
11:30
depending on the
11:32
verb tense that you're using present or
11:34
past tense with the simple past or past
11:36
perfect
11:37
okay next one 13. this house looks
11:41
terrible right it's leaning to one side
11:45
situation or environment the condition
11:49
of this house is very bad in fact
11:53
this house should be torn down it's not
11:55
safe
11:56
the condition is unsafe what is the
12:00
condition of this house
12:01
dangerous unsafe it should be torn down
12:05
and a new house should be built a new
12:07
house the condition is very good
12:09
and the condition is safe okay so the
12:12
situation environment
12:13
is like the condition okay next one
12:17
made of hardened sand and stone made of
12:20
hardened sand and stone
12:22
what is this this is concrete okay so
12:25
you see this truck sometimes
12:27
you see these trucks at kong su
12:30
jung kang sites right and that's
12:33
construction site
12:34
and they use concrete to build buildings
12:38
or other types of things roads walls
12:42
concrete is used for a lot of different
12:44
things and they use sand
12:45
and stone crushed up stone water also
12:49
and they can make concrete okay made of
12:52
hardened
12:53
sand and stone concrete this isn't hard
12:55
this is wet
12:56
but after it dries it becomes hard and
12:58
it's a very strong
13:00
building material okay number 15
13:04
a huge field with grass and few
13:07
trees so a huge field
13:10
lots of grass a few trees here and there
13:13
we call this place a plane a plane
13:17
and if you talk about the planes usually
13:19
people say the planes
13:21
like if they say the great plains the
13:23
great plains is a
13:24
is an area designated in the middle of
13:27
america
13:28
it involves states like texas oklahoma
13:31
nebraska
13:32
uh and higher up the dakotas um
13:36
these states they're not a lot of trees
13:39
it's just very flat
13:40
and lots of grass and there's a lot of
13:42
farmland there now a long time ago it's
13:45
just grass and buffalo
13:46
would run up and down this area and the
13:48
indians would hunt the buffalo
13:50
those were the great plains okay so
13:53
plain
13:54
a very flat area huge field you can see
13:56
from miles and miles and miles
13:58
it takes days to go across the great
14:00
plains
14:02
okay last word a deep hole if you have a
14:04
deep hole like this this looks like a
14:06
mining operation
14:07
but a deep hole we call it a pit i used
14:10
to work for a mining company
14:12
in america i was in the human resources
14:14
department at a large mining company
14:16
and that's what we call we call it the
14:18
pit we say the north pit the south pit
14:20
right so a pit is a deep hole but pit
14:23
doesn't just mean mining
14:25
it can be a natural pit for example
14:27
sometimes you hear on the news
14:29
where the ground just opens up and they
14:31
call that a sinkhole
14:32
but it's also you can also say it's a
14:34
pit it's just a deep hole
14:36
in the ground it's a pit okay that's our
14:39
words
14:40
let's go over the words how well do we
14:42
remember these words let's do some
14:44
exercises
14:46
number one i enjoy movies they are great
14:49
beep
14:50
and then we have the words here so we
14:52
have a waste
14:53
be audience c entertainment
14:56
d people what did we say about this word
14:59
we said that
15:00
something that you do for fun
15:04
right like a movie it could be playing a
15:07
video game
15:08
it could be playing soccer there's many
15:10
forms of it what is it
15:12
of course we talked about entertainment
15:14
i enjoy movies
15:15
they are great entertainment not waste
15:18
that doesn't make sense
15:19
not audience that doesn't make sense and
15:22
not people
15:23
movies are not people that's weird
15:25
movies are a form
15:27
of entertainment there are many types of
15:29
entertainment
15:30
there are many forms of entertainment
15:32
movies
15:33
are one type of entertainment
15:36
okay skipping number two going to three
15:39
you can see
15:40
monkeys in cages at the what
15:43
where can you go and see animals in
15:46
cages hopefully not in cages that's not
15:48
very nice that's not very good
15:49
hopefully they're in open areas but
15:51
sometimes they're in large cages
15:53
okay where do you see them and the
15:55
planes in the jungle
15:57
at the zoo or in the at the environment
16:01
right notice we say at that's important
16:04
too
16:05
because we don't say at the planes we
16:07
say on the plains
16:09
we don't say at the jungle we say in the
16:11
jungle let me write this down for you
16:14
on the plains in
16:17
the oops in the jungle at
16:20
the zoo and in
16:24
the environment so really we see at here
16:27
at is here so that kind of gives us the
16:28
idea anyway
16:30
right you can see monkeys in cages at
16:32
the zoo
16:33
we say at the zoo we don't you can say
16:35
in the zoo but
16:37
it's more common to say at the zoo but
16:39
we don't say at the planes we say
16:41
on the planes we don't say at the jungle
16:44
we say
16:45
in the jungle and environment is usually
16:48
common to say
16:49
in the environment in an environment
16:52
so just looking at the preposition zoo
16:55
is the only one that we have to choose
16:57
so zoo is the answer
16:58
but zoo is also the only one that makes
17:00
sense you don't see monkeys in cages on
17:02
the plains or
17:04
in the jungle the jungle is a natural
17:06
environment
17:07
you don't have cages in the jungle where
17:09
monkeys live
17:10
that's crazy and in the enviro in the
17:13
environment that doesn't
17:15
fit well with the sentence anyway the
17:16
best answer is zoo even if we don't
17:18
worry about the preposition
17:20
okay next one number five i was beep
17:24
at a good school what are what is done
17:27
to you at a school
17:28
not nothing bad that sounds about what
17:30
it's done to you at a school
17:31
but in a positive sense what happens to
17:35
you
17:35
at school right are you educated
17:38
are you entertained are you kept are you
17:41
treated
17:42
well you could be all four of those
17:44
things but one of those is the
17:46
best choice i was educated
17:49
at a good school hopefully you are
17:52
if it's a good school you will get a
17:54
good education
17:56
so you will be educated at a good school
17:59
i was
18:00
educated at a good school you could say
18:02
i was
18:03
entertained at a good school but
18:06
the purpose for going to school is not
18:08
to be entertained
18:10
the purpose for going to school is to be
18:12
educated
18:13
so that's not a very good fit i was kept
18:16
at a good school this sounds like you
18:18
were kept a prisoner at a good school
18:20
that sounds a little strange
18:21
it's possible grammatically but it
18:23
sounds strange
18:25
i was treated at a good school and that
18:27
sounds odd too
18:28
because that doesn't say anything you
18:30
were treated at a good school
18:32
usually we have to say i was treated
18:33
well or was treated poorly
18:36
right how were you treated if you just
18:38
say i was treated at a good school that
18:39
doesn't say anything
18:41
what does it say and so it doesn't fit
18:43
the best answer is educated i was
18:45
educated at a good school it means i got
18:47
a good education
18:50
seven my dog is beep he has two
18:52
different colored
18:53
eyes well that's strange if your dog has
18:57
one blue eye and one brown eye that's
19:00
kind of strange right
19:01
so would you say your dog is poor your
19:03
dog is special
19:04
your dog is small or your dog is old
19:08
okay well strange can be unusual
19:12
right it can be uh different
19:15
it can be special not ordinary right
19:19
so the only one is that fits is special
19:21
pore doesn't fit my dog is poor
19:23
doesn't have any money dogs don't care
19:25
about that my dog is small
19:28
okay your dog is small but why would you
19:30
say he has two different colored eyes
19:32
that's not an example of being small
19:35
my dog is old okay well he's old but why
19:38
would you say is two different colored
19:39
eyes
19:40
having two different colored eyes is not
19:42
an example of being old
19:44
but having two different colored eyes is
19:46
an example of being special
19:48
so make sure that this adjective fits
19:51
the
19:52
explanation or the example right if this
19:55
example does not fit the adjective
19:59
it's not a good match it's not a good
20:01
connection so special is the best choice
20:04
here
20:04
because you're saying the first sentence
20:06
and then you're giving an example of
20:08
that
20:08
okay so always make sure you have that
20:10
connection when you're filling in
20:12
exercises like this okay that wraps up
20:15
the vocabulary section
20:16
now let's take a short break and go into
20:19
the reading
20:20
part let's take a break
20:40
you
