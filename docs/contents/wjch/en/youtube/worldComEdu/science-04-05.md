hello everybody and welcome back to
american textbook reading
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
we're going over science book for
lesson five habitats
habitats of course are places where
people or animals live and plants of
course as well
in this lesson you will discover various
kinds of habitats of course there are
many different
types of environments or places
where living things live we'll talk
about those
we'll also talk about the differences
between
fresh water and salt water habitats
okay so let's get started
our first word for the lesson is tundra
tundra is a
very interesting habitat it's a very
cold habitat
it's large means very wide you can see
forever
it's all the same it's flat not really a
lot of mountains or hills or valleys
just flat land very cold no trees grow
there
and usually it's covered with snow or
ice
sometimes in the summertime it might
warm up and you get some plants that
will grow
but most of the year it's covered in
snow and ice it's a very
cold and bleak and maybe a little
depressing
habitat but many animals do live there
so that's tanja
next we have woodland woodland of course
is a land
that many trees grow on because wood
means many trees if there's a wood
wood means forest many trees so it's an
area of land
on which many trees grow most
people live around woodlands
in europe in asia north america there
are many woodlands and
most so most people live near trees
of course woodlands are a little bit
cooler than
jungles jungles are like woodlands
but they are in hot humid environments
woodlands are usually more northern or
southern
and they're cooler and not as humid
okay habitat
a habitat of course i just mentioned
that at the beginning of this lesson
a habitat is the home of an animal
or plant it's kind of more of a
scientific word a more
casual or friendly word is home right
what's your home you could say uh well
my habitat is an apartment of course
that sounds a little strange
don't say that that you're being a
little scientific when you do say that
so
but habitat just means your home or the
home of a plant or
animal somebody's home
salt water salt water is
of or found in water that contains
salt okay but basically salt water is uh
most of the oceans in the world or all
the oceans in the world
many seas are salt water
why are they salt water because of the
accumulation of salt especially from
rivers and from all the runoff from the
land
that water has a lot of salt in it of
course there's also a lot of salt in the
water naturally
so most of the oceans if you taste the
water it is salty you can't drink it you
cannot drink
ocean water because it has too much salt
in it
and it's not going to do your body any
good to drink it
the famous sailor once said you know
sailing on the ocean he said
water water everywhere and not a drop to
drink
right so if you're sailing on a boat
make sure you bring
fresh water with you you can't drink
salt water
of course the opposite fresh water fresh
water we can drink
and fresh water is very refreshing
especially on a hot day
so fresh water is of or found in water
that does not
contain salt and most rivers and lakes
are fresh water you see a picture here
of a man
on a canoe or kayak and he's paddling
what looks like
in what looks like a lake and of course
many lakes inland
in in like the continent or in land
you have a body of water small body of
water we call those lakes ponds
are smaller those are fresh water and
most of the water that we drink we get
from lakes or reservoirs
or streams and rivers okay
moist moist means a little bit wet
sometimes you have the baby wipes you
know the mood tissue in korean mood
tissue
mul of course means water um and those
are moist they have they contain a
little bit of water in it they're a
little bit wet
so if you if you just get a tissue right
a clean like kleenex you know that's dry
but if you get a baby wipe or mood
tissue that's wet
so the the baby wipe is moist it
contains a little bit of water
of course it's much easier to clean
things your face or the table whatever
with a moist tissue than it is with the
dry tissue you should have to put some
water
on the tissue if you want to clean
something okay
coat are you wearing a coat hopefully
not
hopefully it's not cold where you are
but a coat
of course is either something that we
wear when it's cold but we can also
describe the
animal's fur as a coat coat is the fur
covering an
animal's body has and of course we have
a
we see a picture of here of a polar bear
a polar bear has a very thick coat it's
a very thick hair
and of course a little bit of some skin
and fat
that keeps the polar bear warm because
the polar bear lives
in the tundra in very cold areas of
course our dog
she's a beagle i feel sorry for her in
the summertime
because she's covered in fur and it's
very hot and humid in the summer
so she has a coat she can't take off her
coat
poor donkey whenever we're at home and
the air conditioning is on in the
summertime
she's always under the air conditioner
because she can't take her coat off
but okay so coat fur covering an
animal's body has
okay those are our words for the lesson
now what are some kinds of habitats we
talked about that
i said you will discover various types
of habitats and in the
um vocabulary section we talked about
some of these
first of all we talked about tundra
tunja of course
is up north really far north or southern
areas where it's really cold all the
time
and it's flat you know in this picture
we have some
some hills but usually flat and not many
trees will grow there
and it's usually covered in ice or snow
that's tundra
next we talked about woodlands or
woodland
and of course that's a nice area where
many trees are growing
and you know in the forest many forests
cover many parts of the earth and
woodlands
are nice places to live actually we also
have desert
we don't really talk about deserts but
deserts of course you know from pictures
the most famous desert in the world is
the sahara desert
in northern africa it's very dry so dry
that there are no plants plants can't
grow there because there's no water
so it's just sand some animals do live
in the desert
very interesting animals but usually you
don't see them during the daytime they
might come out at night when it's cooler
but desert of course is very dry and
just covered in sand
okay next we have a lake and a lake is
an example of a fresh
water habitat the water there is fresh
and of course
this looks like a nice beautiful
mountain lake so a nice body of fresh
water
and of course oceans ocean is the next
type of habitat
and of course oceans cover most
of the earth's surface so if you talk
about habitats ocean is the most common
type of habitat
because of the area that it occupies
most
of the world most of the earth is
covered in
oceans so we're talking about habitats
ocean is the biggest right by far
okay so these are different types of
habitats
let's talk about freshwater habitat
versus
salt water habitat so how are they
different or what kinds of different
animals live in these two different
habitats
animals in a freshwater habitat are
usually frogs
frogs will live in fresh water beavers
beavers are very common in freshwater
they make their dams and
rivers and they make small ponds or
lakes
because they dam the river and they'll
make a little pond and that's where they
live and then they hunt for their food
they get their food out of the pond and
they have their little home
in the dam beavers are really
interesting animals
okay and then we have carp carp are a
type of fish
and a lot of people will keep carp in
i think they're in koi ponds i think you
call them koi ponds
and even in buildings they'll have
because they're interesting fish they're
very easy to take care of
they're colorful sometimes and uh
they'll keep them in like
little you know you go into a very fancy
or expensive building
and sometimes they have a little pond in
the lobby and
you can see fish swimming around in
there
they're usually carp of course you have
other fish but usually they use carp
okay those are animals in a freshwater
habitat what about animals in a salt
water habitat well we have dolphins of
course dolphins are famous they're
friendly
they're actually very friendly and those
are very intelligent animals as well
and they live in the ocean so they're
salt water
animals we also have jellyfish
you gotta be careful around jellyfish
especially in australia
but anywhere in the world really
jellyfish
are very basic primitive forms of life
and they're usually in the first few
feet of the water because they're up
near where the sun is they want to get
the sunlight
so if you're swimming in the ocean be
careful of jellyfish if you feel
something stinging
your arm or even your face as you're
swimming along with a mask and a snorkel
sometimes you get the little pricks or
the little
uh it hurts a little bit you're like
what is that
those are little strands of jellyfish
because they're very poisonous
some jellyfish are really poisonous they
can they can
they're very dangerous but yeah just be
careful jellyfish
when you're out swimming in the ocean
okay and then finally squid squid are
amazing creatures they're really cool
to find or to see underwater
and they of course just live in the salt
water okay
so animals in freshwater habitat animals
in assault water habitats
okay let's do the reading together and
the reading in the reading we will talk
about different types of habitats
and some of the animals and plants that
grow there
are you ready as usual try to read along
with me
focus on pronunciation and also on the
words that we learned in the vocabulary
here we go a tundra
is a very cold habitat
there is a lot of snow in the winter
plants living in the tundra do not grow
very tall
and they grow close together
tundra animals like polar bears
and wolves have thick coats
to keep them warm
a woodland is a habitat that gets a lot
of rain
and has many trees
the soil is moist many producers and
consumers
live in woodlands if you remember from
the previous lesson we talked about
producers and consumers right producers
are usually plants
and consumers are all types of animals
many producers and consumers
live in woodlands
a desert is a very dry habitat with
sandy soil it is very hot in the day
and very cold at night
few producers or consumers
live in deserts there's just not enough
water
okay the ocean is the biggest habitat
many types of salt water plants and
animals
live in the ocean they have adapted
to live in the ocean
lakes are freshwater habitats that are
on land freshwater plants and animals
live in lakes
okay that's our reading let's take a
look at how it's organized
the reading was organized on the idea of
classify in other words to put things
into different
categories or classifications to
describe them
and of course this reading passage was
about many different types of habitats
so we can classify these different types
of habitats
and talk about the characteristics or
what they are like we can describe them
okay so first we talked about tundra
tundras are very what and polar bears
live there okay well tundras of course
as i said before are very
cold tundras are very cold
and polar bears live there polar bears
can live there because they have
thick coats so they the cold doesn't
bother them so much
woodland is our next type of habitat
woodlands have a lot of trees
obviously because they're woods they're
forests trees and the soil is what
a lot of rain has to fall there in order
for many trees to grow
so the soil is wet the soil is
moist
okay next we have desert
deserts are very what habitats with
sandy soil
nothing really grows in the desert
there's no plants because there's no
water
so deserts if there's no water it is
very
dry so deserts are very dry
habitats with sandy soil
then we have ocean and lake now
ocean and lake what's the difference
between the ocean and lake we talked
about this quite a bit
in the ocean salt water plants
so salt water
salt water plants and animals live in
the
ocean and in lakes
what's the opposite of salt water fresh
water
fresh water fresh
water so fresh water plants and animals
live in lakes and that's the difference
of course salt water has salt in it
fresh water doesn't have salt in it and
that's
we call it fresh water because of our
own bias right we can drink it so it's
fresh
we can't drink the ocean water so we
don't call it fresh we call it salt
water
but to animals that live in the ocean
hey that's where they live
they drink that water or they they use
that water for their own bodies
so to them salt water is fresh water so
it's kind of interesting you know
thinking about your your perspective on
things
so but as far as humans go ocean salt
water
lakes rivers streams fresh water
water usually that is on land okay
well those that that's our lesson for
today
interesting idea to think about the
different types of habitat and of course
the world is
you know it's a big world and there's
lots of different types of environments
lots of different uh natural types
of areas you know you have deserts you
have woodlands you have jungles
you have tundra and many places are very
beautiful
and each area has its own types of
animals and plants
and people who live there have their own
ways of living to adapt to the
environments as well
so it's very interesting think about the
world think about the
many different places you can go and the
different types of environments
habitats that you can experience it's
fascinating
okay anyway that's a lesson for today
hope you learned a lot as usual
and we'll see you in the next lesson
take care everybody bye-bye

hello everybody and welcome back to
00:10
american textbook reading
00:12
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
00:14
we're going over science book for
00:16
lesson five habitats
00:19
habitats of course are places where
00:23
people or animals live and plants of
00:26
course as well
00:28
in this lesson you will discover various
00:31
kinds of habitats of course there are
00:33
many different
00:34
types of environments or places
00:38
where living things live we'll talk
00:41
about those
00:42
we'll also talk about the differences
00:44
between
00:45
fresh water and salt water habitats
00:49
okay so let's get started
00:53
our first word for the lesson is tundra
00:56
tundra is a
00:57
very interesting habitat it's a very
00:59
cold habitat
01:00
it's large means very wide you can see
01:03
forever
01:04
it's all the same it's flat not really a
01:08
lot of mountains or hills or valleys
01:10
just flat land very cold no trees grow
01:14
there
01:14
and usually it's covered with snow or
01:17
ice
01:18
sometimes in the summertime it might
01:20
warm up and you get some plants that
01:21
will grow
01:22
but most of the year it's covered in
01:24
snow and ice it's a very
01:26
cold and bleak and maybe a little
01:30
depressing
01:31
habitat but many animals do live there
01:33
so that's tanja
01:36
next we have woodland woodland of course
01:39
is a land
01:40
that many trees grow on because wood
01:42
means many trees if there's a wood
01:44
wood means forest many trees so it's an
01:47
area of land
01:47
on which many trees grow most
01:50
people live around woodlands
01:54
in europe in asia north america there
01:57
are many woodlands and
01:58
most so most people live near trees
02:01
of course woodlands are a little bit
02:04
cooler than
02:05
jungles jungles are like woodlands
02:08
but they are in hot humid environments
02:11
woodlands are usually more northern or
02:14
southern
02:14
and they're cooler and not as humid
02:17
okay habitat
02:21
a habitat of course i just mentioned
02:23
that at the beginning of this lesson
02:24
a habitat is the home of an animal
02:28
or plant it's kind of more of a
02:29
scientific word a more
02:32
casual or friendly word is home right
02:35
what's your home you could say uh well
02:38
my habitat is an apartment of course
02:40
that sounds a little strange
02:41
don't say that that you're being a
02:43
little scientific when you do say that
02:45
so
02:45
but habitat just means your home or the
02:48
home of a plant or
02:49
animal somebody's home
02:53
salt water salt water is
02:57
of or found in water that contains
03:00
salt okay but basically salt water is uh
03:04
most of the oceans in the world or all
03:06
the oceans in the world
03:07
many seas are salt water
03:11
why are they salt water because of the
03:14
accumulation of salt especially from
03:16
rivers and from all the runoff from the
03:20
land
03:21
that water has a lot of salt in it of
03:23
course there's also a lot of salt in the
03:24
water naturally
03:26
so most of the oceans if you taste the
03:28
water it is salty you can't drink it you
03:31
cannot drink
03:32
ocean water because it has too much salt
03:34
in it
03:35
and it's not going to do your body any
03:37
good to drink it
03:39
the famous sailor once said you know
03:41
sailing on the ocean he said
03:43
water water everywhere and not a drop to
03:46
drink
03:47
right so if you're sailing on a boat
03:49
make sure you bring
03:50
fresh water with you you can't drink
03:53
salt water
03:54
of course the opposite fresh water fresh
03:56
water we can drink
03:59
and fresh water is very refreshing
04:01
especially on a hot day
04:03
so fresh water is of or found in water
04:06
that does not
04:07
contain salt and most rivers and lakes
04:12
are fresh water you see a picture here
04:14
of a man
04:15
on a canoe or kayak and he's paddling
04:19
what looks like
04:20
in what looks like a lake and of course
04:22
many lakes inland
04:23
in in like the continent or in land
04:27
you have a body of water small body of
04:29
water we call those lakes ponds
04:30
are smaller those are fresh water and
04:34
most of the water that we drink we get
04:36
from lakes or reservoirs
04:38
or streams and rivers okay
04:42
moist moist means a little bit wet
04:46
sometimes you have the baby wipes you
04:48
know the mood tissue in korean mood
04:49
tissue
04:50
mul of course means water um and those
04:53
are moist they have they contain a
04:55
little bit of water in it they're a
04:56
little bit wet
04:57
so if you if you just get a tissue right
04:59
a clean like kleenex you know that's dry
05:01
but if you get a baby wipe or mood
05:04
tissue that's wet
05:05
so the the baby wipe is moist it
05:08
contains a little bit of water
05:10
of course it's much easier to clean
05:11
things your face or the table whatever
05:14
with a moist tissue than it is with the
05:17
dry tissue you should have to put some
05:18
water
05:19
on the tissue if you want to clean
05:20
something okay
05:23
coat are you wearing a coat hopefully
05:26
not
05:27
hopefully it's not cold where you are
05:29
but a coat
05:30
of course is either something that we
05:31
wear when it's cold but we can also
05:33
describe the
05:34
animal's fur as a coat coat is the fur
05:38
covering an
05:39
animal's body has and of course we have
05:41
a
05:42
we see a picture of here of a polar bear
05:45
a polar bear has a very thick coat it's
05:48
a very thick hair
05:49
and of course a little bit of some skin
05:52
and fat
05:53
that keeps the polar bear warm because
05:56
the polar bear lives
05:57
in the tundra in very cold areas of
06:00
course our dog
06:01
she's a beagle i feel sorry for her in
06:04
the summertime
06:05
because she's covered in fur and it's
06:07
very hot and humid in the summer
06:09
so she has a coat she can't take off her
06:11
coat
06:12
poor donkey whenever we're at home and
06:14
the air conditioning is on in the
06:16
summertime
06:16
she's always under the air conditioner
06:19
because she can't take her coat off
06:21
but okay so coat fur covering an
06:23
animal's body has
06:25
okay those are our words for the lesson
06:30
now what are some kinds of habitats we
06:32
talked about that
06:33
i said you will discover various types
06:35
of habitats and in the
06:37
um vocabulary section we talked about
06:39
some of these
06:40
first of all we talked about tundra
06:43
tunja of course
06:44
is up north really far north or southern
06:47
areas where it's really cold all the
06:50
time
06:51
and it's flat you know in this picture
06:54
we have some
06:55
some hills but usually flat and not many
06:58
trees will grow there
06:59
and it's usually covered in ice or snow
07:01
that's tundra
07:03
next we talked about woodlands or
07:05
woodland
07:06
and of course that's a nice area where
07:07
many trees are growing
07:10
and you know in the forest many forests
07:14
cover many parts of the earth and
07:16
woodlands
07:17
are nice places to live actually we also
07:20
have desert
07:22
we don't really talk about deserts but
07:23
deserts of course you know from pictures
07:26
the most famous desert in the world is
07:27
the sahara desert
07:29
in northern africa it's very dry so dry
07:32
that there are no plants plants can't
07:34
grow there because there's no water
07:36
so it's just sand some animals do live
07:40
in the desert
07:41
very interesting animals but usually you
07:44
don't see them during the daytime they
07:46
might come out at night when it's cooler
07:48
but desert of course is very dry and
07:51
just covered in sand
07:53
okay next we have a lake and a lake is
07:55
an example of a fresh
07:56
water habitat the water there is fresh
07:59
and of course
08:00
this looks like a nice beautiful
08:01
mountain lake so a nice body of fresh
08:04
water
08:05
and of course oceans ocean is the next
08:08
type of habitat
08:09
and of course oceans cover most
08:12
of the earth's surface so if you talk
08:14
about habitats ocean is the most common
08:16
type of habitat
08:18
because of the area that it occupies
08:21
most
08:22
of the world most of the earth is
08:24
covered in
08:25
oceans so we're talking about habitats
08:28
ocean is the biggest right by far
08:32
okay so these are different types of
08:34
habitats
08:36
let's talk about freshwater habitat
08:38
versus
08:40
salt water habitat so how are they
08:41
different or what kinds of different
08:43
animals live in these two different
08:45
habitats
08:46
animals in a freshwater habitat are
08:48
usually frogs
08:50
frogs will live in fresh water beavers
08:53
beavers are very common in freshwater
08:55
they make their dams and
08:56
rivers and they make small ponds or
08:59
lakes
08:59
because they dam the river and they'll
09:02
make a little pond and that's where they
09:04
live and then they hunt for their food
09:06
they get their food out of the pond and
09:08
they have their little home
09:09
in the dam beavers are really
09:11
interesting animals
09:13
okay and then we have carp carp are a
09:15
type of fish
09:16
and a lot of people will keep carp in
09:20
i think they're in koi ponds i think you
09:22
call them koi ponds
09:23
and even in buildings they'll have
09:25
because they're interesting fish they're
09:27
very easy to take care of
09:28
they're colorful sometimes and uh
09:31
they'll keep them in like
09:32
little you know you go into a very fancy
09:34
or expensive building
09:36
and sometimes they have a little pond in
09:38
the lobby and
09:39
you can see fish swimming around in
09:42
there
09:42
they're usually carp of course you have
09:44
other fish but usually they use carp
09:47
okay those are animals in a freshwater
09:49
habitat what about animals in a salt
09:51
water habitat well we have dolphins of
09:54
course dolphins are famous they're
09:55
friendly
09:56
they're actually very friendly and those
09:58
are very intelligent animals as well
10:00
and they live in the ocean so they're
10:02
salt water
10:03
animals we also have jellyfish
10:07
you gotta be careful around jellyfish
10:09
especially in australia
10:11
but anywhere in the world really
10:12
jellyfish
10:14
are very basic primitive forms of life
10:17
and they're usually in the first few
10:19
feet of the water because they're up
10:21
near where the sun is they want to get
10:22
the sunlight
10:23
so if you're swimming in the ocean be
10:26
careful of jellyfish if you feel
10:27
something stinging
10:28
your arm or even your face as you're
10:31
swimming along with a mask and a snorkel
10:33
sometimes you get the little pricks or
10:35
the little
10:36
uh it hurts a little bit you're like
10:38
what is that
10:39
those are little strands of jellyfish
10:41
because they're very poisonous
10:43
some jellyfish are really poisonous they
10:45
can they can
10:46
they're very dangerous but yeah just be
10:48
careful jellyfish
10:50
when you're out swimming in the ocean
10:51
okay and then finally squid squid are
10:53
amazing creatures they're really cool
10:55
to find or to see underwater
10:58
and they of course just live in the salt
11:00
water okay
11:02
so animals in freshwater habitat animals
11:04
in assault water habitats
11:08
okay let's do the reading together and
11:09
the reading in the reading we will talk
11:11
about different types of habitats
11:13
and some of the animals and plants that
11:16
grow there
11:17
are you ready as usual try to read along
11:20
with me
11:21
focus on pronunciation and also on the
11:24
words that we learned in the vocabulary
11:26
here we go a tundra
11:29
is a very cold habitat
11:32
there is a lot of snow in the winter
11:36
plants living in the tundra do not grow
11:39
very tall
11:41
and they grow close together
11:45
tundra animals like polar bears
11:48
and wolves have thick coats
11:52
to keep them warm
11:57
a woodland is a habitat that gets a lot
12:00
of rain
12:01
and has many trees
12:05
the soil is moist many producers and
12:09
consumers
12:10
live in woodlands if you remember from
12:13
the previous lesson we talked about
12:15
producers and consumers right producers
12:18
are usually plants
12:19
and consumers are all types of animals
12:21
many producers and consumers
12:24
live in woodlands
12:28
a desert is a very dry habitat with
12:32
sandy soil it is very hot in the day
12:36
and very cold at night
12:39
few producers or consumers
12:43
live in deserts there's just not enough
12:46
water
12:47
okay the ocean is the biggest habitat
12:52
many types of salt water plants and
12:55
animals
12:56
live in the ocean they have adapted
13:00
to live in the ocean
13:04
lakes are freshwater habitats that are
13:07
on land freshwater plants and animals
13:11
live in lakes
13:14
okay that's our reading let's take a
13:16
look at how it's organized
13:20
the reading was organized on the idea of
13:24
classify in other words to put things
13:27
into different
13:28
categories or classifications to
13:31
describe them
13:32
and of course this reading passage was
13:34
about many different types of habitats
13:36
so we can classify these different types
13:39
of habitats
13:40
and talk about the characteristics or
13:43
what they are like we can describe them
13:45
okay so first we talked about tundra
13:48
tundras are very what and polar bears
13:51
live there okay well tundras of course
13:53
as i said before are very
13:55
cold tundras are very cold
13:59
and polar bears live there polar bears
14:01
can live there because they have
14:03
thick coats so they the cold doesn't
14:06
bother them so much
14:09
woodland is our next type of habitat
14:11
woodlands have a lot of trees
14:13
obviously because they're woods they're
14:14
forests trees and the soil is what
14:17
a lot of rain has to fall there in order
14:19
for many trees to grow
14:21
so the soil is wet the soil is
14:24
moist
14:28
okay next we have desert
14:31
deserts are very what habitats with
14:33
sandy soil
14:34
nothing really grows in the desert
14:36
there's no plants because there's no
14:38
water
14:38
so deserts if there's no water it is
14:40
very
14:42
dry so deserts are very dry
14:46
habitats with sandy soil
14:49
then we have ocean and lake now
14:53
ocean and lake what's the difference
14:54
between the ocean and lake we talked
14:55
about this quite a bit
14:57
in the ocean salt water plants
15:00
so salt water
15:05
salt water plants and animals live in
15:08
the
15:08
ocean and in lakes
15:12
what's the opposite of salt water fresh
15:15
water
15:16
fresh water fresh
15:19
water so fresh water plants and animals
15:23
live in lakes and that's the difference
15:26
of course salt water has salt in it
15:28
fresh water doesn't have salt in it and
15:31
that's
15:31
we call it fresh water because of our
15:33
own bias right we can drink it so it's
15:35
fresh
15:36
we can't drink the ocean water so we
15:38
don't call it fresh we call it salt
15:40
water
15:41
but to animals that live in the ocean
15:43
hey that's where they live
15:44
they drink that water or they they use
15:46
that water for their own bodies
15:48
so to them salt water is fresh water so
15:51
it's kind of interesting you know
15:52
thinking about your your perspective on
15:55
things
15:56
so but as far as humans go ocean salt
15:59
water
15:59
lakes rivers streams fresh water
16:02
water usually that is on land okay
16:06
well those that that's our lesson for
16:08
today
16:09
interesting idea to think about the
16:11
different types of habitat and of course
16:13
the world is
16:13
you know it's a big world and there's
16:15
lots of different types of environments
16:17
lots of different uh natural types
16:21
of areas you know you have deserts you
16:23
have woodlands you have jungles
16:26
you have tundra and many places are very
16:28
beautiful
16:29
and each area has its own types of
16:32
animals and plants
16:33
and people who live there have their own
16:35
ways of living to adapt to the
16:37
environments as well
16:38
so it's very interesting think about the
16:40
world think about the
16:41
many different places you can go and the
16:43
different types of environments
16:45
habitats that you can experience it's
16:48
fascinating
16:49
okay anyway that's a lesson for today
16:51
hope you learned a lot as usual
16:53
and we'll see you in the next lesson
16:54
take care everybody bye-bye
17:04
[Music]
17:16
