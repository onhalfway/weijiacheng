hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading series
today we're looking at science book 3
unit eight
yes unit eight okay good the unit eight
is about different types of natural
resources natural resources so we will
discover what are
natural resources right that's kind of a
difficult
term uh difficult phrase natural
resources we'll talk about that
and what kinds of energy resources
we have those are very important for our
life
okay so that's the idea behind unit
our lesson eight in today's lesson
okay let's get started with the
vocabulary as usual first of all we can
see our first word
is cole coal is this
black rock you've probably seen coal
before
it's a black substance dug
up from the ground that can burn
you know in unit uh our lesson seven we
just did that
in in this book we talked about animals
that die you know their
their remains get buried under mud
and sand and rock and they turn into
fossils well that doesn't always happen
right sometimes or many times
the bodies of animals and
plants get buried and they get pressed
together and they turn into carbon
carbon is a type of coal and you can
burn it
right so actually coal is the remains
of dead animals and plants that died a
long long time ago
okay so it's a it formed into like a
rock it's a hard rock
and probably your dad or your mom when
they have an
outdoor barbecue they take little pieces
of coal
and they put them in the grill and then
they burn them
right because coal burns it burns very
well
it causes a nice fire and you can cook
meat on top of coal
a lot of barbecues use coal
and if you ever hear of coal-fired
barbecue
it means a barbecue that uses coal so
it's a black
black substance dug up from the ground
that can
burn and it burns and it gives off heat
which allows you to cook things it
allows you to
keep your house warm it even was used to
power
steam engines a long time ago and still
today
okay next or or
is we talked about coal coal is like a
natural resource right
but coal is a specific type of natural
resource
you use it to burn now oars is similar
to cold but
ore is for any kind of metal
or like mineral it's a rock or soil
which you can get
metal out of ore so what kind of metal
can you get out of ore well there's tin
ore so if you have like a an aluminum
can
for example it's made out of tin or
actually aluminum
but cans were made out of tin a long
time ago they would mine the oar
and they would melt it down and they get
the liquid metal it's called tin
but it's not just tin many precious
metals like
copper silver gold
these are all found in oars when a lot
of times
when miners dig in the ground they don't
just find you know
silver already made right the silver is
in little
pieces little parts sometimes you can't
even see it and it's
in the rock in the rock we call that
silver ore you maybe you don't see the
silver or gold
but if you crush the rock and you mix it
with chemicals
you can pull the silver gold or copper
out of the rock
and then it becomes an ingot it becomes
pure copper or pure silver or
pure gold it's not an ore anymore it's
the actual metal
but it comes from war it comes from the
ground and we call that
ore rocker soil you can get metal
out of it okay okay next reduce
reduce means to make something smaller
in amount or
size right if you
have a candy jar in your home
right you eat the candy every day well
the amount of candy
reduces right it gets smaller and
smaller every day
until your mom buys more but be careful
don't eat too much candy okay but anyway
reduce
means to make something smaller in
amount or size
okay next use up if you use
all of something so there's nothing left
you used it all up if you have a printer
at home and you have some paper right
every day you might print one or two
pieces of paper
you know pages of something maybe your
homework
maybe you know something you have to
read and you print those pages well
after a while you know the amount of
paper the amount of paper is reduced
every day until it's all gone
the paper is used up so the paper is all
used up or the paper is used up you
don't have to say all used up some
people do
but just say the paper is all used up uh
when we talk about resources it's very
common to talk about used up
all the coal is used up all the ore
in this mine is used up it's gone we
used it all
we it we used all of it so there's no
more left
okay good next we have replace
to replace means to provide a new thing
instead of something that was broken
stolen or lost
but it also means in this case in the
picture we can see
a forest and it looks like people have
come and they cut down the trees
to get wood to build houses and other
things
now you can replace those trees by
growing new
trees and we see this in many parts of
the world
especially in many there are many
companies that are called
logging companies logging
l o g why because log
this is a log here that's a log and this
is another log here
so those are called logs so a loging
company is a company
that cuts trees for the logs
sends them to a factory they make wood
or paper out of them
and then we use those products in our
everyday life but the logging companies
they have to be smart right they don't
want to go out of business so they'll
they'll plant new trees in this area the
new trees will grow into bigger trees
and then you know 20 years later 30
years later
they'll come and cut those trees down so
they have to think
really far ahead in the future so to
replace to provide a new one instead of
something broken lost
or stolen okay next supply
supply is the amount of something that
you have remember i gave you the example
about the paper
and a printer right that amount of paper
that is your paper supply
that is how much paper you have so the
supply is
how much of something you have so
whether it's paper
whether it's ore whether it's trees uh
whatever whether it's coal
whatever how much is there that is your
supply if you have a big supply
you have a lot of it if you have a small
supply you only have a little bit of it
you will use it up quickly if it's small
okay so now we have a video showing
supply and you know
it's kind of a long story but i'll get
to supply what we can see here
are many machines in a field what are
these machines they're
called wind turbines and what are those
things that are turning around
those are called propellers so i'm
teaching you a couple
new vocabulary terms look how high they
are look at how small the cards are over
there wow that's really
these things are really high up there
but they're high because they catch the
wind
the wind is stronger the higher you get
off the ground
the stronger the wind is so you want to
put your propellers
i told you pro
this is a propeller this part here
that's the part that turns
when the wind hits the propeller it
makes it turn
now on an airplane a propeller airplane
there's an engine that makes the
propeller turn and the the propeller
makes the wind
it pushes the plane forward in the wind
in the air
and that allows it to take off we don't
have propeller airplanes now we have jet
airplanes
but this is the opposite there's no
engine making the propeller turn
it's the wind that makes the propeller
turn now here we have a turbine
well the whole and you can call the
whole thing well that's a stand
this is called a wind
turbine now a turbine is a machine that
turns the
energy there's the motion of the
propeller
creates energy and the turbine changes
that uh the the movement the
that energy of moving it turns it into
a different type of energy that we call
electricity
of course everybody's familiar with
electricity so when you think about it
these wind turbines they are using the
supply of wind
now wind is always there right so supply
here we have an endless
endless supply
whoops supply of yeah this pen
sometimes misses supply there we go
and p okay so endless means it does not
end it's always there endless
supply so if you have something that
never
that can never be used up right it's an
endless supply of when you think about
it the wind will always be there
the wind keeps moving so it is an
endless supply
of energy great okay
well that's our vocabulary for this
lesson let's move on to the main ideas
okay one main idea of this lesson is
talking about
uh you know what kinds of resources
are endless we just talked about endless
resources
and what kinds of resources are not
endless there's only a certain amount of
it
when it's used up it's gone well on the
top we can see resources that are
replaced
quickly by the earth these are the
endless
supply of endless supply
oops endless supply
of we have an endless supply of water
right because
water keeps being recycled through the
earth's atmosphere we always have fresh
water
falling from the sky in terms of rain
so resources that are quickly replaced
by the earth
water makes power to light and heat
homes
especially if you have water flowing
down a river you put a dam
and the water the motion of the water
makes the turbines spin
right turbines that change that energy
into
electricity and we call that a
hydroelectric
hydro hydro means water
right it's from i believe greek a lot of
words in english come from greek and
latin origins hydro means
water hydroelectric so we call
uh dams the famous dam hoover dam
uh near las vegas in america
hydroelectric
hydroelectric is a hydroelectric dam
right hydroelectric plant a
hydroelectric
facility so hydroelectric means it
creates energy from the motion of
water right a very old type of
hydroelectric source
was a windmill along hundreds of years
ago
before there was electric we don't call
it a hydroelectric we just call it a
hydro like a hydro-powered
windmill actually use the wind but it
also
people would also build mills by the
water would turn this big wheel
and that would help the farmer crush
the wheat into flour right so that's
that's the earliest form of the
hydro power uh that uh that people use
one of the earlier forms
now water of course and of course wind
we already talked about wind when we saw
the video of the wind
turbines but wind also makes power to
light
and heat homes in this case we see the
wind is very strong looks like it's
probably a hurricane
or a typhoon but the wind can have a lot
of energy
so if you build a very tall high wind
turbine
you can capture you can get some of that
energy from the wind
and these are endless supplies of
resources what's one more by the way
that's very popular these days
one more that's not in this chart is
sunlight
sunlight is also a resource that is
quickly replaced it's not really
replaced it's just always there
right kind of like wind so sunlight and
we call that
if you use sunlight to make electricity
we call it
solar solar because soul
star from the sun solar
power solar power so you might have
solar
panels on your home or uh on your school
or uh at your dad's or mom's office
building
solar powered solar panels will make
solar power these are resources
that are quickly replaced by the earth
now some resources are not
quickly replaced what are they well
first of all we have
ores oars are used for making many goods
like i said or so that looks like a
mixture of many
many different types of ores there wow
that looks very
precious very valuable my precious okay
sorry but
it looks very precious they have gold
looks like there might be i don't know
silver there
yeah it's interesting okay anyway it
looks like some gold oars
now gold is used for making a lot of
different goods
not just jewelry but in your cell phone
you probably have some
small amounts of gold gold is very good
for making
semiconductors and conducting
electricity on circuit boards
so gold is used for a lot of different
uh industries and so is silver and of
course
copper because copper is you know in
many buildings they use copper wires
to transmit electricity because copper
is very good
for carrying electricity from one place
to another
so oars are used for making many goods
but the thing about oars is that
you know if you have a mine right you
have miners and they dig up that dirt
once that ore the dirt the oar and the
dirt
once it's gone that's it the mine closes
the miners have to go somewhere else to
continue their job right
so once that ore is all used up it's
gone and it takes a
very long long time i mean it's not like
these resources they're
they're they'll never be replaced but
they are not
replaced quickly right the key word is
quickly right these are replaced quickly
right
water wind and sunlight of course
they're always there but
other ores take a long time to form it
takes many
hundreds of thousands millions of years
to
deposit ores in a certain area
coal is the same thing right coal like i
said is made from
rotting animals and plants right and
you have to have a lot of them and it
takes a long time under pressure
to turn the remains of animals and
plants
into a hard substance that is coal the
carbon
it doesn't it takes you know it if we
use the coal
faster then it's being generated then we
will use up all the coal
so coal is another resource that is not
quickly
replaced by the earth and trees of
course are not quickly
trees are probably the out of ore and
coal trees are replaced
more quickly much more quickly than coal
and and ores
but trees still take a long time
remember the example i talked about the
logging companies right
they when they when they cut down the
trees they will plant new trees
but they have to wait a long time 20 30
years
so the people who planted those trees
maybe they're retired
by the time those trees are grown large
enough to be cut down
for new logs it depends of course on the
tree some trees grow faster than others
but like i said the logging companies
have to think far into the future they
have to make plans
very long term plans to make sure that
the wood is being replaced
but it takes a long time and trees are
used for building homes
and furniture so you know we of course a
lot of
our chairs our sometimes homes
are built out of wood so and of course a
lot of paper
so be careful about using paper too
because you don't want to use up too
much
too many resources so these are
resources that are quickly replaced by
the earth and resources that are not
quickly replaced by the earth okay next
we have what are some energy resources
first of all we have fossil fuels
now fossil fuels remember in unit 7 we
talked about what are fossils and how
are they formed
and i when i was talking about coal
right i talked about fossils because
coals um are created by the remains of
dead animals and plants and as we saw in
unit
lesson seven those things now they can
either become a fossil
or they can uh turn into coal
okay and so fuels that form over time
from the remains of plants and animals
but it's not just coal
right coal is what happens when the
remains are pushed
and under pressure and they form into a
hard substance that's cool
but sometimes they're under a lot of
pressure and they turn into a liquid
substance and when it's liquid it's also
very black coal is black it's carbon
basically carbon is black
and but if it's not solid it's a liquid
and we call that oil right so if you see
usually in places like deserts or very
dry areas doesn't have to be but usually
you can see uh sometimes people will
will dig or sometimes just walking
around you see some black
gooey and smelly material it looks like
water but it's very thick water just
bubbling up
to the surface you're like what is that
that is natural oil
sometimes well usually nowadays
companies drill
into the earth because the oil is
underground and there's a big body of
like liquid oil underground
and they drill down there because it's
under pressure it's in the liquid so
when they drill down
that pressure pushes the oil up up the
hole
and you have an oil geyser and usually
they put a machine on there
to catch that oil as it's coming up and
to pump it into trucks and they take it
to a factory
and they turn it into gasoline so that
you can drive your car
right or you can use it to heat your
home
propane natural gas is propane that's
the we have the picture of the stove
many stoves use
natural gas or in korea you say lpg
liquid petroleum gas right lpg
okay so uh oil coal and natural gas are
types of fossil fuels
actually that energy is coming from
animals and plants that lived
millions of years ago so interesting
so think about that the next time you're
using you're using oil coal or gas
you're actually using the bodies of
animals and plants that lived a long
long time ago
okay now the problem with fossil fuels
of course is that they
are not replaced quickly by nature it
takes a very very long time
to turn a dead animal or a plant
into coal gas or oil
so many companies are looking
to for alternative alternative energy
why is it
alternative because alternative is just
kind of new
you know if history was changed
if humans had developed soul
have had developed solar hydro
and wind power a long time ago we
wouldn't call them alternate
uh energy resources we just call them
traditional energy
energy sources but the history in
history
fossil fuels were easier to use they
gave more energy
they didn't require as much science or
knowledge technology to develop
so people use them because they were
easier so they were first
fossil fuels were first so they are
traditional
traditional means of energy traditional
did i spell that right traditional yeah
okay good traditional so those are the
traditional those are the old time
the the fossil fuel the energy sources
that have been
around for a long time now something new
that replaces traditional you can call
it
alternative also alternative kind of
like means
new right new so these are new energy
resources
and with all the wind as you can see
that's a very old it's a very old
resource but it's not mainstream not a
lot of people it's only
wind was only used for special cases you
know
a long time ago but nowadays we're
building more wind turbines
someday maybe alternative energy
resources
will be more important than traditional
fossil fuels
that's the hope of many people because
they're cleaner they're better for the
environment
and we don't have to worry about running
out of them using them all
up so energy resources other than fossil
fuel
of course we talked about water wind and
sun water remembers hydro hydro power
and sun is solar power we don't have a
fancy word for wind
i'm sorry this is wind power okay so
hydro and solar
okay so those are the ideas the main
ideas for this lesson
next let's take a look at the reading
okay so let's go over the reading and as
usual
read along with me to practice
pronunciation or read along silently in
your mind but think about the
pronunciation the words
and especially focus on the key
vocabulary
for this lesson okay you guys ready here
we go
earth has many natural resources
we use them in many ways
a tree is a natural resource
we use wood to make goods
like furniture
a tree can be replaced
if we cut down the tree another one can
grow
but it takes many years
okay so not quickly next
coal is a natural resource
we use coal to make electricity
an ore is another natural resource
ores contain metal
we use metal for making many goods
oh by the way goods also means
products products and of course product
is something that you can buy in a store
and use so like i said before ores can
be used from anything from jewelry
to cell phones computers many different
things
okay continuing some
natural resources like coal and ore
take millions of years to be made
their supply is limited once used
they cannot be replaced quickly
key word yes they can be replaced but
not quickly it takes millions
of years so once used they cannot
be replaced quickly next
we are using these resources very
quickly these days
we need to reduce the amount of natural
resources
we use they need to be conserved
conserved conserved means
to use
uh to use
in small amounts
and correctly small amounts
and you have to think about how you use
them
don't waste if you waste resources
that's the opposite
of conserving resources consumers like
keep or
save resources of course we have to use
them but we shouldn't
waste them waste is the opposite of
conserve
okay so they need to be conserved
if all the coal and ore are used up
electricity and goods will have to be
made
in other ways okay so this is very
important
very important reading passage okay next
let's take a look at the main idea
how is this org how is this information
organized
okay so now it's time to take a look at
how the information and the reading
passage is
organized the reading skill here is main
idea
and details so remember many reading
passage
passages will throw out or introduce
a main idea at the beginning so this is
the main idea
but what are the details that support
that main idea so you have the main idea
that's a general statement but now we
need more specific
details that support that main idea or
further explain the main idea well here
we have the main idea is natural
resources
are used for many things we have three
supporting details okay well actually
more than that
we have about four okay so
first of all we have some natural
resources have a limited supply
so we need to beep our use of them
so we need to you know we talked about
conserve that's kind of the idea
remember conserve
is don't waste so conserve would be like
to limit
to limit or reduce
the use of something so the word here
that we need to use is we need to
reduce oops what happened there redo so
that's okay
it's okay reduce so we need to reduce
our use of them and reduce that's also
another word that
i highlighted in the reading that is
related to conserve
conserve that's that's the opposite of
waste right
so if we reduce our use of these
resources
we are conserving those resources we're
saving them for later don't waste them
so reduce your use of natural resources
okay good next we have the starts with
the blank so beep
is used to make electricity from the
reading passage
what did they say was used to make
electricity
it's a natural resources that takes a
long time
to make it's formed from dead animals
and plants and it's a solid form
remember we said coal c-o-a-l
coal is that hard black it looks like a
rock but it's actually softer than a
rock you can crush it
with a hammer very easily easier than
rock um
and it burns and you burn it to make
electricity
so coal is used to make electricity then
beep contain
metal which is used to make many things
coal doesn't contain metal
but what contains metal right we talked
about gold silver copper as examples
we talked about oars ores now
ors is a count noun so one or
gold ore silver or copper ore these are
different types of ores
so we put s on the end different types
of
ores okay oars contain
metal which is used to make many things
like we talked about
jewelry cell phones computers
electric wiring and houses things like
that
okay finally another type of natural
resource
is trees trees are natural resources
their supply is not limited right but
it takes a long time to re to replace
them that's the word trees can be
be replaced obviously i just said that
trees can be replaced but not quickly
it takes a a long not a long time
but relatively uh not a long time i mean
compared to coal and ore which take
millions of years to make
trees can be replaced in decades
right tens of years so 20 years 30 years
40 years
we can replace the trees that we cut
down and like i said many
logging companies do this and they
should do this
okay so very interesting lesson we
talked about different types of natural
resources right of course we use natural
resources all the time
natural resources make our lives more
comfortable more convenient more easier
to live
imagine if we didn't have electricity
imagine if we
didn't have wooden furniture or houses
imagine if we couldn't use any metal
right we'd be living in caves right uh
hunting and hunting animals with we
wouldn't even have sticks because we
didn't have wood
be throwing rocks at animals to get our
dinner that's not a very good existence
so natural resources make our lives much
richer more rewarding
very convenient but we have to be
careful about how we use
natural resources we have to conserve
them we have to reduce them
so at your home right don't leave lights
on very long
turn the light off save reduce your
amount of
reduce your use of electricity
don't leave the water running on for too
long reduce
your use of fresh water right
conserve our natural resources
not just for you but also for your
children and your children's children
for the future
generations very important that we don't
use up
all of our natural resources because we
wouldn't want to live in a world
without all of these things without
everything that makes our lives
comfortable
and easy and more rewarding okay so
kind of an uh important idea in this
lesson hope you learned a lot
thanks for studying with me and we'll
see you in the next lesson take care
everybody
bye bye

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading series
00:12
today we're looking at science book 3
00:15
unit eight
00:17
yes unit eight okay good the unit eight
00:20
is about different types of natural
00:22
resources natural resources so we will
00:25
discover what are
00:26
natural resources right that's kind of a
00:29
difficult
00:30
term uh difficult phrase natural
00:33
resources we'll talk about that
00:35
and what kinds of energy resources
00:39
we have those are very important for our
00:42
life
00:42
okay so that's the idea behind unit
00:46
our lesson eight in today's lesson
00:50
okay let's get started with the
00:51
vocabulary as usual first of all we can
00:54
see our first word
00:55
is cole coal is this
00:59
black rock you've probably seen coal
01:02
before
01:03
it's a black substance dug
01:06
up from the ground that can burn
01:10
you know in unit uh our lesson seven we
01:12
just did that
01:13
in in this book we talked about animals
01:16
that die you know their
01:17
their remains get buried under mud
01:20
and sand and rock and they turn into
01:22
fossils well that doesn't always happen
01:25
right sometimes or many times
01:29
the bodies of animals and
01:32
plants get buried and they get pressed
01:35
together and they turn into carbon
01:38
carbon is a type of coal and you can
01:40
burn it
01:41
right so actually coal is the remains
01:45
of dead animals and plants that died a
01:47
long long time ago
01:48
okay so it's a it formed into like a
01:51
rock it's a hard rock
01:52
and probably your dad or your mom when
01:55
they have an
01:56
outdoor barbecue they take little pieces
01:59
of coal
02:00
and they put them in the grill and then
02:02
they burn them
02:03
right because coal burns it burns very
02:06
well
02:07
it causes a nice fire and you can cook
02:09
meat on top of coal
02:11
a lot of barbecues use coal
02:14
and if you ever hear of coal-fired
02:16
barbecue
02:17
it means a barbecue that uses coal so
02:20
it's a black
02:21
black substance dug up from the ground
02:23
that can
02:24
burn and it burns and it gives off heat
02:28
which allows you to cook things it
02:30
allows you to
02:31
keep your house warm it even was used to
02:34
power
02:34
steam engines a long time ago and still
02:38
today
02:38
okay next or or
02:41
is we talked about coal coal is like a
02:44
natural resource right
02:46
but coal is a specific type of natural
02:49
resource
02:50
you use it to burn now oars is similar
02:52
to cold but
02:53
ore is for any kind of metal
02:57
or like mineral it's a rock or soil
03:00
which you can get
03:01
metal out of ore so what kind of metal
03:04
can you get out of ore well there's tin
03:07
ore so if you have like a an aluminum
03:10
can
03:10
for example it's made out of tin or
03:13
actually aluminum
03:14
but cans were made out of tin a long
03:16
time ago they would mine the oar
03:18
and they would melt it down and they get
03:20
the liquid metal it's called tin
03:22
but it's not just tin many precious
03:25
metals like
03:26
copper silver gold
03:29
these are all found in oars when a lot
03:32
of times
03:33
when miners dig in the ground they don't
03:35
just find you know
03:36
silver already made right the silver is
03:39
in little
03:40
pieces little parts sometimes you can't
03:42
even see it and it's
03:43
in the rock in the rock we call that
03:46
silver ore you maybe you don't see the
03:49
silver or gold
03:50
but if you crush the rock and you mix it
03:52
with chemicals
03:54
you can pull the silver gold or copper
03:56
out of the rock
03:57
and then it becomes an ingot it becomes
04:01
pure copper or pure silver or
04:04
pure gold it's not an ore anymore it's
04:06
the actual metal
04:08
but it comes from war it comes from the
04:10
ground and we call that
04:11
ore rocker soil you can get metal
04:14
out of it okay okay next reduce
04:18
reduce means to make something smaller
04:20
in amount or
04:21
size right if you
04:25
have a candy jar in your home
04:28
right you eat the candy every day well
04:31
the amount of candy
04:32
reduces right it gets smaller and
04:34
smaller every day
04:36
until your mom buys more but be careful
04:39
don't eat too much candy okay but anyway
04:41
reduce
04:41
means to make something smaller in
04:43
amount or size
04:45
okay next use up if you use
04:49
all of something so there's nothing left
04:52
you used it all up if you have a printer
04:55
at home and you have some paper right
04:58
every day you might print one or two
05:00
pieces of paper
05:02
you know pages of something maybe your
05:05
homework
05:06
maybe you know something you have to
05:08
read and you print those pages well
05:10
after a while you know the amount of
05:12
paper the amount of paper is reduced
05:14
every day until it's all gone
05:16
the paper is used up so the paper is all
05:19
used up or the paper is used up you
05:22
don't have to say all used up some
05:24
people do
05:24
but just say the paper is all used up uh
05:28
when we talk about resources it's very
05:30
common to talk about used up
05:32
all the coal is used up all the ore
05:36
in this mine is used up it's gone we
05:38
used it all
05:39
we it we used all of it so there's no
05:42
more left
05:43
okay good next we have replace
05:46
to replace means to provide a new thing
05:50
instead of something that was broken
05:51
stolen or lost
05:53
but it also means in this case in the
05:55
picture we can see
05:56
a forest and it looks like people have
05:59
come and they cut down the trees
06:01
to get wood to build houses and other
06:03
things
06:04
now you can replace those trees by
06:07
growing new
06:08
trees and we see this in many parts of
06:10
the world
06:11
especially in many there are many
06:13
companies that are called
06:15
logging companies logging
06:18
l o g why because log
06:21
this is a log here that's a log and this
06:24
is another log here
06:26
so those are called logs so a loging
06:31
company is a company
06:34
that cuts trees for the logs
06:37
sends them to a factory they make wood
06:40
or paper out of them
06:42
and then we use those products in our
06:43
everyday life but the logging companies
06:45
they have to be smart right they don't
06:47
want to go out of business so they'll
06:49
they'll plant new trees in this area the
06:51
new trees will grow into bigger trees
06:53
and then you know 20 years later 30
06:56
years later
06:56
they'll come and cut those trees down so
06:58
they have to think
07:00
really far ahead in the future so to
07:03
replace to provide a new one instead of
07:05
something broken lost
07:06
or stolen okay next supply
07:10
supply is the amount of something that
07:12
you have remember i gave you the example
07:15
about the paper
07:16
and a printer right that amount of paper
07:19
that is your paper supply
07:22
that is how much paper you have so the
07:25
supply is
07:26
how much of something you have so
07:28
whether it's paper
07:29
whether it's ore whether it's trees uh
07:32
whatever whether it's coal
07:34
whatever how much is there that is your
07:36
supply if you have a big supply
07:38
you have a lot of it if you have a small
07:41
supply you only have a little bit of it
07:43
you will use it up quickly if it's small
07:46
okay so now we have a video showing
07:48
supply and you know
07:50
it's kind of a long story but i'll get
07:52
to supply what we can see here
07:54
are many machines in a field what are
07:56
these machines they're
07:58
called wind turbines and what are those
08:01
things that are turning around
08:03
those are called propellers so i'm
08:05
teaching you a couple
08:07
new vocabulary terms look how high they
08:09
are look at how small the cards are over
08:11
there wow that's really
08:12
these things are really high up there
08:14
but they're high because they catch the
08:15
wind
08:16
the wind is stronger the higher you get
08:19
off the ground
08:20
the stronger the wind is so you want to
08:22
put your propellers
08:23
i told you pro
08:27
this is a propeller this part here
08:30
that's the part that turns
08:31
when the wind hits the propeller it
08:33
makes it turn
08:34
now on an airplane a propeller airplane
08:38
there's an engine that makes the
08:39
propeller turn and the the propeller
08:41
makes the wind
08:42
it pushes the plane forward in the wind
08:45
in the air
08:46
and that allows it to take off we don't
08:48
have propeller airplanes now we have jet
08:50
airplanes
08:51
but this is the opposite there's no
08:53
engine making the propeller turn
08:55
it's the wind that makes the propeller
08:57
turn now here we have a turbine
09:00
well the whole and you can call the
09:02
whole thing well that's a stand
09:04
this is called a wind
09:07
turbine now a turbine is a machine that
09:11
turns the
09:12
energy there's the motion of the
09:14
propeller
09:15
creates energy and the turbine changes
09:18
that uh the the movement the
09:22
that energy of moving it turns it into
09:25
a different type of energy that we call
09:27
electricity
09:28
of course everybody's familiar with
09:30
electricity so when you think about it
09:32
these wind turbines they are using the
09:35
supply of wind
09:36
now wind is always there right so supply
09:39
here we have an endless
09:43
endless supply
09:46
whoops supply of yeah this pen
09:49
sometimes misses supply there we go
09:52
and p okay so endless means it does not
09:57
end it's always there endless
10:00
supply so if you have something that
10:02
never
10:03
that can never be used up right it's an
10:06
endless supply of when you think about
10:07
it the wind will always be there
10:09
the wind keeps moving so it is an
10:11
endless supply
10:13
of energy great okay
10:16
well that's our vocabulary for this
10:18
lesson let's move on to the main ideas
10:22
okay one main idea of this lesson is
10:25
talking about
10:26
uh you know what kinds of resources
10:30
are endless we just talked about endless
10:33
resources
10:34
and what kinds of resources are not
10:36
endless there's only a certain amount of
10:38
it
10:38
when it's used up it's gone well on the
10:41
top we can see resources that are
10:43
replaced
10:44
quickly by the earth these are the
10:46
endless
10:48
supply of endless supply
10:51
oops endless supply
10:56
of we have an endless supply of water
10:59
right because
11:00
water keeps being recycled through the
11:02
earth's atmosphere we always have fresh
11:04
water
11:05
falling from the sky in terms of rain
11:08
so resources that are quickly replaced
11:10
by the earth
11:11
water makes power to light and heat
11:14
homes
11:15
especially if you have water flowing
11:17
down a river you put a dam
11:19
and the water the motion of the water
11:21
makes the turbines spin
11:22
right turbines that change that energy
11:25
into
11:27
electricity and we call that a
11:30
hydroelectric
11:32
hydro hydro means water
11:36
right it's from i believe greek a lot of
11:40
words in english come from greek and
11:41
latin origins hydro means
11:43
water hydroelectric so we call
11:47
uh dams the famous dam hoover dam
11:51
uh near las vegas in america
11:54
hydroelectric
11:56
hydroelectric is a hydroelectric dam
11:59
right hydroelectric plant a
12:02
hydroelectric
12:04
facility so hydroelectric means it
12:08
creates energy from the motion of
12:11
water right a very old type of
12:13
hydroelectric source
12:15
was a windmill along hundreds of years
12:18
ago
12:18
before there was electric we don't call
12:20
it a hydroelectric we just call it a
12:22
hydro like a hydro-powered
12:26
windmill actually use the wind but it
12:29
also
12:30
people would also build mills by the
12:32
water would turn this big wheel
12:34
and that would help the farmer crush
12:37
the wheat into flour right so that's
12:39
that's the earliest form of the
12:41
hydro power uh that uh that people use
12:44
one of the earlier forms
12:47
now water of course and of course wind
12:49
we already talked about wind when we saw
12:50
the video of the wind
12:52
turbines but wind also makes power to
12:54
light
12:55
and heat homes in this case we see the
12:57
wind is very strong looks like it's
12:59
probably a hurricane
13:01
or a typhoon but the wind can have a lot
13:04
of energy
13:04
so if you build a very tall high wind
13:08
turbine
13:08
you can capture you can get some of that
13:10
energy from the wind
13:12
and these are endless supplies of
13:16
resources what's one more by the way
13:18
that's very popular these days
13:20
one more that's not in this chart is
13:22
sunlight
13:24
sunlight is also a resource that is
13:27
quickly replaced it's not really
13:28
replaced it's just always there
13:30
right kind of like wind so sunlight and
13:33
we call that
13:34
if you use sunlight to make electricity
13:36
we call it
13:37
solar solar because soul
13:40
star from the sun solar
13:44
power solar power so you might have
13:47
solar
13:48
panels on your home or uh on your school
13:51
or uh at your dad's or mom's office
13:54
building
13:55
solar powered solar panels will make
13:58
solar power these are resources
13:59
that are quickly replaced by the earth
14:02
now some resources are not
14:04
quickly replaced what are they well
14:06
first of all we have
14:07
ores oars are used for making many goods
14:10
like i said or so that looks like a
14:12
mixture of many
14:13
many different types of ores there wow
14:15
that looks very
14:16
precious very valuable my precious okay
14:18
sorry but
14:19
it looks very precious they have gold
14:21
looks like there might be i don't know
14:23
silver there
14:24
yeah it's interesting okay anyway it
14:26
looks like some gold oars
14:27
now gold is used for making a lot of
14:30
different goods
14:30
not just jewelry but in your cell phone
14:33
you probably have some
14:34
small amounts of gold gold is very good
14:37
for making
14:37
semiconductors and conducting
14:40
electricity on circuit boards
14:42
so gold is used for a lot of different
14:44
uh industries and so is silver and of
14:47
course
14:47
copper because copper is you know in
14:50
many buildings they use copper wires
14:52
to transmit electricity because copper
14:55
is very good
14:56
for carrying electricity from one place
14:59
to another
15:00
so oars are used for making many goods
15:02
but the thing about oars is that
15:04
you know if you have a mine right you
15:05
have miners and they dig up that dirt
15:08
once that ore the dirt the oar and the
15:10
dirt
15:11
once it's gone that's it the mine closes
15:14
the miners have to go somewhere else to
15:17
continue their job right
15:18
so once that ore is all used up it's
15:20
gone and it takes a
15:22
very long long time i mean it's not like
15:24
these resources they're
15:26
they're they'll never be replaced but
15:28
they are not
15:29
replaced quickly right the key word is
15:33
quickly right these are replaced quickly
15:36
right
15:36
water wind and sunlight of course
15:38
they're always there but
15:40
other ores take a long time to form it
15:43
takes many
15:43
hundreds of thousands millions of years
15:46
to
15:47
deposit ores in a certain area
15:50
coal is the same thing right coal like i
15:53
said is made from
15:54
rotting animals and plants right and
15:57
you have to have a lot of them and it
15:59
takes a long time under pressure
16:01
to turn the remains of animals and
16:04
plants
16:04
into a hard substance that is coal the
16:08
carbon
16:09
it doesn't it takes you know it if we
16:12
use the coal
16:13
faster then it's being generated then we
16:15
will use up all the coal
16:17
so coal is another resource that is not
16:20
quickly
16:21
replaced by the earth and trees of
16:23
course are not quickly
16:25
trees are probably the out of ore and
16:27
coal trees are replaced
16:30
more quickly much more quickly than coal
16:32
and and ores
16:33
but trees still take a long time
16:35
remember the example i talked about the
16:37
logging companies right
16:38
they when they when they cut down the
16:40
trees they will plant new trees
16:42
but they have to wait a long time 20 30
16:45
years
16:45
so the people who planted those trees
16:47
maybe they're retired
16:49
by the time those trees are grown large
16:52
enough to be cut down
16:53
for new logs it depends of course on the
16:55
tree some trees grow faster than others
16:58
but like i said the logging companies
17:00
have to think far into the future they
17:02
have to make plans
17:03
very long term plans to make sure that
17:06
the wood is being replaced
17:08
but it takes a long time and trees are
17:10
used for building homes
17:12
and furniture so you know we of course a
17:15
lot of
17:16
our chairs our sometimes homes
17:19
are built out of wood so and of course a
17:22
lot of paper
17:23
so be careful about using paper too
17:25
because you don't want to use up too
17:26
much
17:27
too many resources so these are
17:29
resources that are quickly replaced by
17:31
the earth and resources that are not
17:33
quickly replaced by the earth okay next
17:36
we have what are some energy resources
17:39
first of all we have fossil fuels
17:41
now fossil fuels remember in unit 7 we
17:43
talked about what are fossils and how
17:45
are they formed
17:46
and i when i was talking about coal
17:49
right i talked about fossils because
17:51
coals um are created by the remains of
17:54
dead animals and plants and as we saw in
17:56
unit
17:57
lesson seven those things now they can
18:00
either become a fossil
18:01
or they can uh turn into coal
18:04
okay and so fuels that form over time
18:08
from the remains of plants and animals
18:09
but it's not just coal
18:11
right coal is what happens when the
18:13
remains are pushed
18:15
and under pressure and they form into a
18:17
hard substance that's cool
18:18
but sometimes they're under a lot of
18:20
pressure and they turn into a liquid
18:23
substance and when it's liquid it's also
18:26
very black coal is black it's carbon
18:28
basically carbon is black
18:29
and but if it's not solid it's a liquid
18:33
and we call that oil right so if you see
18:37
usually in places like deserts or very
18:39
dry areas doesn't have to be but usually
18:42
you can see uh sometimes people will
18:45
will dig or sometimes just walking
18:47
around you see some black
18:49
gooey and smelly material it looks like
18:52
water but it's very thick water just
18:55
bubbling up
18:56
to the surface you're like what is that
18:58
that is natural oil
19:00
sometimes well usually nowadays
19:02
companies drill
19:03
into the earth because the oil is
19:06
underground and there's a big body of
19:07
like liquid oil underground
19:09
and they drill down there because it's
19:10
under pressure it's in the liquid so
19:12
when they drill down
19:13
that pressure pushes the oil up up the
19:16
hole
19:17
and you have an oil geyser and usually
19:20
they put a machine on there
19:21
to catch that oil as it's coming up and
19:24
to pump it into trucks and they take it
19:25
to a factory
19:26
and they turn it into gasoline so that
19:28
you can drive your car
19:30
right or you can use it to heat your
19:32
home
19:33
propane natural gas is propane that's
19:37
the we have the picture of the stove
19:39
many stoves use
19:40
natural gas or in korea you say lpg
19:43
liquid petroleum gas right lpg
19:47
okay so uh oil coal and natural gas are
19:50
types of fossil fuels
19:52
actually that energy is coming from
19:53
animals and plants that lived
19:55
millions of years ago so interesting
19:58
so think about that the next time you're
20:00
using you're using oil coal or gas
20:02
you're actually using the bodies of
20:04
animals and plants that lived a long
20:06
long time ago
20:07
okay now the problem with fossil fuels
20:10
of course is that they
20:12
are not replaced quickly by nature it
20:14
takes a very very long time
20:17
to turn a dead animal or a plant
20:20
into coal gas or oil
20:24
so many companies are looking
20:28
to for alternative alternative energy
20:31
why is it
20:31
alternative because alternative is just
20:34
kind of new
20:35
you know if history was changed
20:38
if humans had developed soul
20:42
have had developed solar hydro
20:46
and wind power a long time ago we
20:48
wouldn't call them alternate
20:50
uh energy resources we just call them
20:52
traditional energy
20:53
energy sources but the history in
20:56
history
20:56
fossil fuels were easier to use they
20:59
gave more energy
21:01
they didn't require as much science or
21:03
knowledge technology to develop
21:05
so people use them because they were
21:07
easier so they were first
21:09
fossil fuels were first so they are
21:11
traditional
21:13
traditional means of energy traditional
21:17
did i spell that right traditional yeah
21:19
okay good traditional so those are the
21:22
traditional those are the old time
21:24
the the fossil fuel the energy sources
21:27
that have been
21:28
around for a long time now something new
21:31
that replaces traditional you can call
21:33
it
21:33
alternative also alternative kind of
21:35
like means
21:36
new right new so these are new energy
21:39
resources
21:40
and with all the wind as you can see
21:42
that's a very old it's a very old
21:44
resource but it's not mainstream not a
21:46
lot of people it's only
21:47
wind was only used for special cases you
21:50
know
21:51
a long time ago but nowadays we're
21:53
building more wind turbines
21:55
someday maybe alternative energy
21:58
resources
21:58
will be more important than traditional
22:01
fossil fuels
22:02
that's the hope of many people because
22:04
they're cleaner they're better for the
22:06
environment
22:06
and we don't have to worry about running
22:08
out of them using them all
22:10
up so energy resources other than fossil
22:13
fuel
22:13
of course we talked about water wind and
22:17
sun water remembers hydro hydro power
22:22
and sun is solar power we don't have a
22:25
fancy word for wind
22:26
i'm sorry this is wind power okay so
22:29
hydro and solar
22:30
okay so those are the ideas the main
22:32
ideas for this lesson
22:34
next let's take a look at the reading
22:38
okay so let's go over the reading and as
22:41
usual
22:43
read along with me to practice
22:44
pronunciation or read along silently in
22:47
your mind but think about the
22:48
pronunciation the words
22:49
and especially focus on the key
22:52
vocabulary
22:53
for this lesson okay you guys ready here
22:56
we go
22:57
earth has many natural resources
23:01
we use them in many ways
23:04
a tree is a natural resource
23:08
we use wood to make goods
23:11
like furniture
23:14
a tree can be replaced
23:18
if we cut down the tree another one can
23:22
grow
23:23
but it takes many years
23:26
okay so not quickly next
23:30
coal is a natural resource
23:33
we use coal to make electricity
23:37
an ore is another natural resource
23:42
ores contain metal
23:45
we use metal for making many goods
23:50
oh by the way goods also means
23:53
products products and of course product
23:57
is something that you can buy in a store
24:01
and use so like i said before ores can
24:05
be used from anything from jewelry
24:07
to cell phones computers many different
24:10
things
24:10
okay continuing some
24:14
natural resources like coal and ore
24:17
take millions of years to be made
24:21
their supply is limited once used
24:25
they cannot be replaced quickly
24:29
key word yes they can be replaced but
24:32
not quickly it takes millions
24:35
of years so once used they cannot
24:39
be replaced quickly next
24:43
we are using these resources very
24:46
quickly these days
24:49
we need to reduce the amount of natural
24:52
resources
24:53
we use they need to be conserved
24:58
conserved conserved means
25:02
to use
25:06
uh to use
25:09
in small amounts
25:12
and correctly small amounts
25:15
and you have to think about how you use
25:18
them
25:18
don't waste if you waste resources
25:21
that's the opposite
25:23
of conserving resources consumers like
25:25
keep or
25:26
save resources of course we have to use
25:28
them but we shouldn't
25:29
waste them waste is the opposite of
25:32
conserve
25:33
okay so they need to be conserved
25:36
if all the coal and ore are used up
25:40
electricity and goods will have to be
25:43
made
25:43
in other ways okay so this is very
25:47
important
25:48
very important reading passage okay next
25:50
let's take a look at the main idea
25:52
how is this org how is this information
25:55
organized
25:57
okay so now it's time to take a look at
25:59
how the information and the reading
26:01
passage is
26:02
organized the reading skill here is main
26:05
idea
26:05
and details so remember many reading
26:08
passage
26:09
passages will throw out or introduce
26:12
a main idea at the beginning so this is
26:15
the main idea
26:16
but what are the details that support
26:18
that main idea so you have the main idea
26:20
that's a general statement but now we
26:22
need more specific
26:24
details that support that main idea or
26:28
further explain the main idea well here
26:32
we have the main idea is natural
26:34
resources
26:35
are used for many things we have three
26:38
supporting details okay well actually
26:41
more than that
26:41
we have about four okay so
26:44
first of all we have some natural
26:46
resources have a limited supply
26:49
so we need to beep our use of them
26:53
so we need to you know we talked about
26:55
conserve that's kind of the idea
26:57
remember conserve
26:59
is don't waste so conserve would be like
27:01
to limit
27:02
to limit or reduce
27:06
the use of something so the word here
27:09
that we need to use is we need to
27:10
reduce oops what happened there redo so
27:14
that's okay
27:15
it's okay reduce so we need to reduce
27:18
our use of them and reduce that's also
27:21
another word that
27:22
i highlighted in the reading that is
27:24
related to conserve
27:27
conserve that's that's the opposite of
27:29
waste right
27:30
so if we reduce our use of these
27:32
resources
27:33
we are conserving those resources we're
27:36
saving them for later don't waste them
27:40
so reduce your use of natural resources
27:43
okay good next we have the starts with
27:46
the blank so beep
27:47
is used to make electricity from the
27:49
reading passage
27:50
what did they say was used to make
27:53
electricity
27:54
it's a natural resources that takes a
27:56
long time
27:57
to make it's formed from dead animals
28:00
and plants and it's a solid form
28:02
remember we said coal c-o-a-l
28:06
coal is that hard black it looks like a
28:09
rock but it's actually softer than a
28:10
rock you can crush it
28:12
with a hammer very easily easier than
28:15
rock um
28:16
and it burns and you burn it to make
28:18
electricity
28:19
so coal is used to make electricity then
28:22
beep contain
28:23
metal which is used to make many things
28:25
coal doesn't contain metal
28:27
but what contains metal right we talked
28:29
about gold silver copper as examples
28:32
we talked about oars ores now
28:36
ors is a count noun so one or
28:39
gold ore silver or copper ore these are
28:42
different types of ores
28:44
so we put s on the end different types
28:47
of
28:47
ores okay oars contain
28:50
metal which is used to make many things
28:53
like we talked about
28:54
jewelry cell phones computers
28:57
electric wiring and houses things like
28:59
that
29:00
okay finally another type of natural
29:03
resource
29:04
is trees trees are natural resources
29:07
their supply is not limited right but
29:12
it takes a long time to re to replace
29:14
them that's the word trees can be
29:16
be replaced obviously i just said that
29:19
trees can be replaced but not quickly
29:22
it takes a a long not a long time
29:26
but relatively uh not a long time i mean
29:30
compared to coal and ore which take
29:33
millions of years to make
29:34
trees can be replaced in decades
29:38
right tens of years so 20 years 30 years
29:42
40 years
29:43
we can replace the trees that we cut
29:45
down and like i said many
29:47
logging companies do this and they
29:49
should do this
29:51
okay so very interesting lesson we
29:54
talked about different types of natural
29:56
resources right of course we use natural
29:58
resources all the time
29:59
natural resources make our lives more
30:03
comfortable more convenient more easier
30:05
to live
30:06
imagine if we didn't have electricity
30:09
imagine if we
30:10
didn't have wooden furniture or houses
30:13
imagine if we couldn't use any metal
30:15
right we'd be living in caves right uh
30:19
hunting and hunting animals with we
30:22
wouldn't even have sticks because we
30:23
didn't have wood
30:25
be throwing rocks at animals to get our
30:26
dinner that's not a very good existence
30:29
so natural resources make our lives much
30:33
richer more rewarding
30:34
very convenient but we have to be
30:36
careful about how we use
30:38
natural resources we have to conserve
30:40
them we have to reduce them
30:42
so at your home right don't leave lights
30:45
on very long
30:46
turn the light off save reduce your
30:48
amount of
30:50
reduce your use of electricity
30:53
don't leave the water running on for too
30:55
long reduce
30:56
your use of fresh water right
30:59
conserve our natural resources
31:02
not just for you but also for your
31:04
children and your children's children
31:06
for the future
31:07
generations very important that we don't
31:10
use up
31:11
all of our natural resources because we
31:13
wouldn't want to live in a world
31:15
without all of these things without
31:17
everything that makes our lives
31:19
comfortable
31:19
and easy and more rewarding okay so
31:23
kind of an uh important idea in this
31:25
lesson hope you learned a lot
31:27
thanks for studying with me and we'll
31:28
see you in the next lesson take care
31:30
everybody
31:31
bye bye
