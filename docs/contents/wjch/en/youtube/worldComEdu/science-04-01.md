hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading i'm brian stewart and we're
starting off with
book four in the science series
and we're starting of course with lesson
one lesson one is
grouping plants grouping means to put
things into different
groups and this is a big part of science
right
scientists like to say how things are
similar and put them together in a
certain group
so they can study those things as a
group and see how they are different
from other things what are the
differences between
other groups so in this unit we will
talk about
or we will discover how we can group
plants together by their flowers
and how we can group plants together
by their stems okay so this lesson will
be all about
plants as usual we start off with the
vocabulary section
and our first word actually two words is
flowering plant now
you know what a flower is right we have
a nice picture of many flowers here
and flowers are of course there's many
colors many different kinds
those are flowers and then we you of
course you know what a plant is
but here we're combining the two words
and we're using
ing so flower ring
we're changing the flower which is a
noun
we're changing it into an adjective so
this whole word
is now an adjective to describe
what kind of plant is it
well a flowering plant what kind of
plant it's a plant
which produces flowers
so not all plants produce
or create or make flowers
only certain types of plants do and we
call those plants
flowering plants okay
next we have conifer conifer
now you probably have seen many conifers
especially if you live
in the northern part or the southern
parts
of the world they're not too many
conifers in the hot
uh regions around the equator depends
also of course on your altitude but
anyway
a conifer is a tree that produces seeds
inside cones if you've seen a
pine cone pine cones are probably the
most famous most common
but inside the pine cone there are seeds
inside there
and the pine cone will fall off the tree
the seeds will fall out
well we'll talk about that a little bit
later but the seeds are protected
by the cone and of course many people
use those cones for decorations
in the winter time but if you live in
the northern areas or in an area where
there's a lot of snow
there are many conifers pine trees for
example
are a very famous type of conifer
next we have moss now moss grows
on rocks usually rocks
could grow on buildings too of course
concrete but it's a small
it's a small green plant that grows in
wet areas
moss needs water and usually a lot of
water
in the air to grow water in the air we
call by the way is
humidity humidity
so if there's a lot of humidity in the
climate
there's a good chance that moss will
grow and moss is just that green
uh plant that grows on rocks it also
grows on
trees and in fact it's interesting when
i was growing up
i grew up in the american west and
people said if you want to know
directions like north
south east and west there's a common
saying
that goes like this moss always grows
on the north side of the tree
why would moss grow on the north side of
the tree well
in the american west that's north of the
equator so the sun is over here
the tree is here the sun is at the
equator that's south because you're in
the northern hemisphere
so the sun doesn't really touch the
northern part of the tree
so in the morning when there's a lot of
humidity in the air
the water stays on the north part of the
tree
longer so that's better conditions
for the moss to grow there the moss
doesn't really grow on the south side of
the tree because the sun will dry
that side of the tree out there's too
dry there's not enough water
so instead the moss will grow on the
north side of the tree so you know
that's kind of an
interesting thing that i learned it's
not you know it depends on
on where you are of course it's better
to use a compass
but it's a common saying moss grows on
the north side of a tree so if you want
to know which direction is north
look for the moss okay that will show
you
which way north is anyway
fern now if you live in again
a cool but humid environment and i'm
thinking about the pacific
northwest oregon washington state
northern california a place where there
are it's kind of cool but there's a lot
of water in the air it's humid
and there's also a lot of trees covering
so
the sun doesn't really dry out the
ground very much
you'll see a lot of ferns and ferns are
green plants with long stems and thin
leaves
it's a perfect picture of them and i i
of course wherever you live you might
see ferns
they usually grow on the ground in a
forest
trees around not too many trees because
they need to have sunlight
but that's where they usually grow and
you can
you can hide in the ferns right your dog
probably likes to play in the ferns but
usually ferns will occur
in cool rain forests
okay spore
what is a spore well you know what seeds
are
many plants produce seeds and if you eat
an apple you can see the seed
but some plants don't create seeds they
create
spores and a spore is a tiny
reproductive reproductive means
a new organism can grow from it of
course a seed
if you have an apple apple an appleseed
a new apple tree
can grow from the seed well a new fern
can grow from a fern
spore reproductive bodies of ferns and
mosses
similar to the seeds of other plants
so ferns and mosses they don't
create seeds they create spores
next we have contain contain means
to have something inside an
object so there's a very good example
that's a good picture you know there's a
seed inside the avocado
but we can also talk about you know
contain doesn't just mean natural things
this i have a water bottle it's a
plastic water bottle
this plastic water bottle what's inside
it water
so the plastic bottle contains
water it's to have something inside
of an object okay that means to contain
so an avocado will contain a big
avocado seed okay avocados are good for
making guacamole by the way okay good
anyway contain maple
now canada is famous for their maple
trees maple trees grow
in northern climates where it's cooler
and they have big leaves they have
really largely maple leaves are
maple leaves are quite large and they
turn red or yellow
in the fall so when it gets colder and
it's
going to be winter soon the maple leaves
they're very large
they're not they're not they're useless
during the winter because there's not a
lot of sun
so the trees tree you know if the tree
could think
it's thinking i don't need my leaves in
the winter it's just wasted energy
so the leaves will die and as they die
they turn red
or yellow very beautiful in the fall but
then they fall off the
branches and in the spring new leaves
will grow
so a maple tree is a tree with large
leaves that turn red
or yellow in fall and maple trees are
also famous for making
syrup that you put on your pancakes yum
yum
okay so good that's a maple tree okay
those are our words for this lesson
let's go over the first main idea of
this lesson and that is grouping plants
by flowers
now the title or the introduction of
this lesson
i said scientists like to group living
and non-living organisms you know things
in nature
scientists study match the natural world
and as human beings we like to
group things we like to put things into
certain
classes or groups and of course that's
what's that's exactly what's going on
here
so scientists will take a look at all
different kinds of plants
and say well these plants are uh
plants that that create flowers or these
plants don't make flowers they do
something else
and so they give different names to
those different groupings
and that's how they will know very
quickly if that's your field of study
you can very quickly oh this is this
type of plant that's that type of plant
so how do they group plants by flowers
well of course it's very easy if a plant
if a plant creates a flower they call
those
flowering plants now that's not that's
not the scientific name
but that's an easy way for us to
remember most ordinary people
floored flowering plant flowering plants
obviously
have flowers flowers can make fruit and
seeds
so that's important all plants reproduce
so scientists will look at plants to see
how they reproduce and plants will
reproduce in different ways
so some plants will create flowers
to make seeds or fruits that will
have seeds inside them and that's how
those types of plants
that grouping of plants that's how they
reproduce
and keep growing for new generations
but not all plants do that other some
plants don't have flowers
for example pine trees and pine trees as
i said
is a type of conifer conifer trees
or conifer plants have no flowers they
don't have flowers
they have cones and i talked about cones
before it's hard to describe if i can't
show
you a picture so i didn't try but this
is a good picture of a cone here
they have cones and the cones contain
seeds so
you know i try to get to that before the
seeds are inside those
cones and squirrels and other animals
will try to get those seeds out
because they're very good for to eat
during the winter time
so of course the cone kind of protects
the seeds it makes it more difficult for
the animals to get to those seeds and
hopefully
the idea is that maybe the animal will
pick up that cone get some seeds but
other seeds
as the animal moves that cone other
seeds will be scattered
anyway so that's how conifers
pine trees and other trees like that
will
reproduce now there's another way too
other plants are mosses and ferns
they do not have flowers they don't even
have seeds
instead they use spores to reproduce
and spores are really small i didn't go
over that in the vocabulary but
spores are very small and they're very
light if there's a wind
the spores will distribute they'll
freely
uh disperse or spread out
with a with a slight wind and that's
important
because if the s'mores are small and
light they can easily spread over a
larger area
and the plant has a larger chance of
reproducing
or creating more plants over a wider
area
and that's how mosses and ferns will
reproduce
now another way to group plants is to
not look at how they reproduce
but to look at the physical
characteristics
the physical parts of the
organism whether it's a plant or an
animal in this case of course we're
talking about plants
so we can classify or group
plants by the physical characteristic of
the stem and remember the stem
we talked about this actually in book
three i hope you were with me with for
that
the stem is a part of a plant that
supports the body of the plants
okay so of course when we think of stem
we can think about a tree
and we don't we don't say the stem of a
tree we have a different word for it
so we call it a trunk so the tree
trunk don't say wow that tree has a
large stem
that sounds strange we don't say that
it's issan hale that's very strange
we would say that tree has a very large
trunk or
wow it's a really thick trunk now some
trees have long and slender trunks i'm
thinking of
aspen trees in colorado which are very
beautiful because
their trunks are white they have white
bark they're very beautiful trees
so anyway a tree will have a main stem
and they're called a
trunk so we call the stem a trunk
but tulips we do say tulips and many
other types of flowers like that
flowering plants
roses for example they have stems
and stems when you think of stem you
think it's not very
strong you can break it easily don't
don't go around breaking them just
just to test it but you know that's not
good
but if you're picking the flour you can
pick it because you can break the stem
very easily
you cannot break a tree trunk very
easily so
it's a big difference between a tree
trunk and a stem however the tree trunk
is a stem it's a type of stem okay
so a tulip has a soft green stem and
it's easy to break it off
and give to your mom or your girlfriend
if you have
a girlfriend and uh that's she will
appreciate that but be careful about
whose tulips you're picking right your
mom might get angry if you take the
tulips out of her garden
okay so anyway those are stems bush now
if you go outside perhaps around your
apartment complex or around your houses
in your neighborhood in the city you
will see many
bushes bushes have many wooden
woody stems or wooden stems and of
course bushes
you know if you look inside a bush you
can see a lot of stems going every which
way
and that's it's hard to to move through
a bush i don't recommend it of course
go around the bush but the reason it's
hard to move through a bush
is because they have a lot of stems
going every which way and of course some
of these are branches that's true
but it's hard to move through a bush and
many bushes will grow together
so their stems might cross each other
and it kind of forms a wall it's very
difficult to move through there
now another type of plant is a cactus
and a cactus
depending on the cactus it will have a
thick stem
that stores water this of course is a
picture of a saguaro
we talked about that in an earlier
lesson there are smaller
saguaro is a really big cactus there are
smaller cacti
or cactuses as well and um
they have uh they store water in their
stems because they live in the desert
and they need to have water all plants
need water so
cacti let me just
do this here quickly spell it for you
the plural of cactus is cacti
but a lot of people also just say cactus
says cacti is the old latin
plural of cactus but most people don't
know that they don't care and they just
put
scf yes at the end cactus says
same thing with octopi or octopuses
right so same thing but anyway cactuses
will have thick stems that store
water okay so we can group plants by
whether they make flowers how do they
reproduce we can also group
plants by their physical characteristics
and one way is by their stems
okay okay now it's time to do the
reading
so as usual i will read the reading out
loud
you guys can repeat after me or repeat
in your mind
think about the pronunciation of the
words and of course the meaning of the
words especially the ones
that we looked at in the vocabulary are
you ready
let's begin there are two types of
plants
one type has flowers and the other
does not flowering plants have flowers
flowers can make fruit and seeds
and orange trees flowers make oranges
the fruit contains seeds
flowers can make seeds without making
fruit
most vegetables have flowers
we sometimes eat these flowers
conifers have no flowers but they have
cones the cones contain seeds
the seeds fall out of the cones
they they the seeds they can become
a new conifer tree
another tree with no flowers is the
maple tree
it has unusual seeds they look like
wings the seeds can travel a long way
from the tree
mosses and ferns are unusual plants
they do not have flowers or seeds
they use spores to reproduce instead of
seeds mosses
often grow on wet rocks
ferns usually live in warm shady and wet
places okay so let's go over how this
reading passage is organized how is the
information
in the reading passage organized and
what we have here is
main idea and details so this is a very
common organizational
pattern you have a main idea and then
you support that main idea with details
what is the main idea the main idea is
that one
type of plant has flowers
and the other the other type of plant
you don't have to say that but it's
inferred it's already known type
of plant
does not does not what does not have
flowers so you don't have to repeat this
information
right in the same sentence it's just
kind of known so one type of plant has
flowers
the other does not have flowers okay
good
so what are the details the first detail
is that some plants have flowers and
fruit
fruit contains beep what does fruit
contain
again in the reading passage they talked
about oranges if you open an
orange you will find these little hard
bits don't eat them
and don't you know they can hurt your
teeth so don't bite them
right and you don't uh we don't of
course we don't eat them but you can use
them to plant a new orange tree and
that's a seed
same thing for apples so fruit contains
seeds seeds
okay so fruit contains seeds and that's
how those plants
will reproduce they are flower producing
or flowering
plants now
the next detail starts with a blank beep
right
blank have no flowers but they have
cones
which contain seeds and we talked about
those types of plants
right and i gave you an example a very
famous example are pine trees
pine trees are a type of conifer so
conifers because there are many types
of conifers oops yes conifers
conifers have no flowers but they have
cones
which contain seeds okay so that's how
they are different from
flowering plants now there's another
type of plant that the reading passage
mentioned
and they're two it's another type of
plant
but there's two examples of that type of
plant one was mosses
do you remember the other one the other
one of course was
ferns mosses and ferns
oops i'm sorry s ferns and that's an
e okay so ferns mosses and ferns
do not have flowers or seeds what do
they
use they don't use seeds remember
they're very fine they're very small
they can be carried by the wind very
easily there we call those
spores so they use spores s-p-o-r-e-s
spores to reproduce instead of
seeds so not seeds spores
so mosses and ferns don't have flowers
or seeds they use spores to reproduce
instead of seeds so this lesson was all
about
classifying or grouping different types
of plants and as i said at the beginning
this is what scientists do right a lot
of scientists especially
biologists will group and of course
other
types of scientists as well it's not
just biologists
but especially biologists will group
living organisms
into different groups and that's why you
have all sorts of species names
and families and different
groups but that's a whole you know
that's a very deep lesson
so this is a very important part of
science to group things together
in order to see because if you group
them together you can kind of get a
better idea about
how they work how they reproduce how
they live how they evolved
and so you develop a deeper
understanding about these living
organisms when you do this
so grouping classifying is a very common
technique in science and as we've seen
scientists will group plants according
to different characteristics how do they
reproduce
and what types of physical
characteristics in this case
stems do different types of plants have
so you could basically do this same idea
with almost
any living organism or groups of living
organisms
you can classify them according to how
they reproduce
or their physical characteristics or
maybe some other types of things
that they do or have so
in this lesson we again we talked about
plants how to classify the different
types
and we learned we went over some
interesting vocabulary i hope and some
interesting ideas about plants i hope
you've learned a lot
as always thank you for studying with me
and we'll hope to see you
in the next lesson take care everybody

bye-bye

hello everybody
00:10
welcome back to american textbook
00:12
reading i'm brian stewart and we're
00:14
starting off with
00:15
book four in the science series
00:18
and we're starting of course with lesson
00:20
one lesson one is
00:22
grouping plants grouping means to put
00:25
things into different
00:26
groups and this is a big part of science
00:29
right
00:30
scientists like to say how things are
00:32
similar and put them together in a
00:34
certain group
00:35
so they can study those things as a
00:37
group and see how they are different
00:39
from other things what are the
00:41
differences between
00:42
other groups so in this unit we will
00:45
talk about
00:46
or we will discover how we can group
00:49
plants together by their flowers
00:52
and how we can group plants together
00:55
by their stems okay so this lesson will
00:59
be all about
01:00
plants as usual we start off with the
01:04
vocabulary section
01:05
and our first word actually two words is
01:09
flowering plant now
01:12
you know what a flower is right we have
01:15
a nice picture of many flowers here
01:17
and flowers are of course there's many
01:19
colors many different kinds
01:21
those are flowers and then we you of
01:23
course you know what a plant is
01:25
but here we're combining the two words
01:27
and we're using
01:28
ing so flower ring
01:32
we're changing the flower which is a
01:35
noun
01:36
we're changing it into an adjective so
01:39
this whole word
01:40
is now an adjective to describe
01:43
what kind of plant is it
01:46
well a flowering plant what kind of
01:49
plant it's a plant
01:50
which produces flowers
01:54
so not all plants produce
01:57
or create or make flowers
02:01
only certain types of plants do and we
02:03
call those plants
02:05
flowering plants okay
02:10
next we have conifer conifer
02:14
now you probably have seen many conifers
02:17
especially if you live
02:19
in the northern part or the southern
02:22
parts
02:22
of the world they're not too many
02:24
conifers in the hot
02:27
uh regions around the equator depends
02:30
also of course on your altitude but
02:33
anyway
02:33
a conifer is a tree that produces seeds
02:37
inside cones if you've seen a
02:40
pine cone pine cones are probably the
02:42
most famous most common
02:44
but inside the pine cone there are seeds
02:48
inside there
02:49
and the pine cone will fall off the tree
02:51
the seeds will fall out
02:52
well we'll talk about that a little bit
02:53
later but the seeds are protected
02:56
by the cone and of course many people
02:58
use those cones for decorations
03:00
in the winter time but if you live in
03:03
the northern areas or in an area where
03:04
there's a lot of snow
03:06
there are many conifers pine trees for
03:09
example
03:09
are a very famous type of conifer
03:14
next we have moss now moss grows
03:18
on rocks usually rocks
03:22
could grow on buildings too of course
03:24
concrete but it's a small
03:26
it's a small green plant that grows in
03:28
wet areas
03:29
moss needs water and usually a lot of
03:32
water
03:33
in the air to grow water in the air we
03:36
call by the way is
03:37
humidity humidity
03:40
so if there's a lot of humidity in the
03:43
climate
03:44
there's a good chance that moss will
03:46
grow and moss is just that green
03:48
uh plant that grows on rocks it also
03:51
grows on
03:52
trees and in fact it's interesting when
03:54
i was growing up
03:56
i grew up in the american west and
03:57
people said if you want to know
03:59
directions like north
04:00
south east and west there's a common
04:03
saying
04:04
that goes like this moss always grows
04:07
on the north side of the tree
04:11
why would moss grow on the north side of
04:13
the tree well
04:14
in the american west that's north of the
04:16
equator so the sun is over here
04:18
the tree is here the sun is at the
04:20
equator that's south because you're in
04:22
the northern hemisphere
04:23
so the sun doesn't really touch the
04:26
northern part of the tree
04:28
so in the morning when there's a lot of
04:29
humidity in the air
04:31
the water stays on the north part of the
04:34
tree
04:34
longer so that's better conditions
04:38
for the moss to grow there the moss
04:40
doesn't really grow on the south side of
04:42
the tree because the sun will dry
04:44
that side of the tree out there's too
04:46
dry there's not enough water
04:48
so instead the moss will grow on the
04:49
north side of the tree so you know
04:51
that's kind of an
04:52
interesting thing that i learned it's
04:54
not you know it depends on
04:55
on where you are of course it's better
04:57
to use a compass
04:58
but it's a common saying moss grows on
05:01
the north side of a tree so if you want
05:03
to know which direction is north
05:05
look for the moss okay that will show
05:08
you
05:08
which way north is anyway
05:11
fern now if you live in again
05:15
a cool but humid environment and i'm
05:18
thinking about the pacific
05:20
northwest oregon washington state
05:24
northern california a place where there
05:27
are it's kind of cool but there's a lot
05:30
of water in the air it's humid
05:32
and there's also a lot of trees covering
05:34
so
05:35
the sun doesn't really dry out the
05:37
ground very much
05:38
you'll see a lot of ferns and ferns are
05:40
green plants with long stems and thin
05:42
leaves
05:43
it's a perfect picture of them and i i
05:46
of course wherever you live you might
05:48
see ferns
05:49
they usually grow on the ground in a
05:53
forest
05:53
trees around not too many trees because
05:55
they need to have sunlight
05:57
but that's where they usually grow and
05:59
you can
06:00
you can hide in the ferns right your dog
06:03
probably likes to play in the ferns but
06:06
usually ferns will occur
06:07
in cool rain forests
06:11
okay spore
06:14
what is a spore well you know what seeds
06:17
are
06:17
many plants produce seeds and if you eat
06:20
an apple you can see the seed
06:21
but some plants don't create seeds they
06:24
create
06:24
spores and a spore is a tiny
06:28
reproductive reproductive means
06:32
a new organism can grow from it of
06:34
course a seed
06:35
if you have an apple apple an appleseed
06:38
a new apple tree
06:39
can grow from the seed well a new fern
06:42
can grow from a fern
06:43
spore reproductive bodies of ferns and
06:47
mosses
06:48
similar to the seeds of other plants
06:51
so ferns and mosses they don't
06:54
create seeds they create spores
07:00
next we have contain contain means
07:04
to have something inside an
07:08
object so there's a very good example
07:10
that's a good picture you know there's a
07:11
seed inside the avocado
07:13
but we can also talk about you know
07:15
contain doesn't just mean natural things
07:17
this i have a water bottle it's a
07:19
plastic water bottle
07:20
this plastic water bottle what's inside
07:23
it water
07:24
so the plastic bottle contains
07:27
water it's to have something inside
07:30
of an object okay that means to contain
07:34
so an avocado will contain a big
07:38
avocado seed okay avocados are good for
07:41
making guacamole by the way okay good
07:44
anyway contain maple
07:47
now canada is famous for their maple
07:50
trees maple trees grow
07:52
in northern climates where it's cooler
07:56
and they have big leaves they have
07:58
really largely maple leaves are
08:00
maple leaves are quite large and they
08:02
turn red or yellow
08:04
in the fall so when it gets colder and
08:07
it's
08:08
going to be winter soon the maple leaves
08:10
they're very large
08:12
they're not they're not they're useless
08:13
during the winter because there's not a
08:15
lot of sun
08:16
so the trees tree you know if the tree
08:18
could think
08:19
it's thinking i don't need my leaves in
08:20
the winter it's just wasted energy
08:22
so the leaves will die and as they die
08:25
they turn red
08:26
or yellow very beautiful in the fall but
08:29
then they fall off the
08:30
branches and in the spring new leaves
08:33
will grow
08:34
so a maple tree is a tree with large
08:36
leaves that turn red
08:38
or yellow in fall and maple trees are
08:41
also famous for making
08:43
syrup that you put on your pancakes yum
08:46
yum
08:46
okay so good that's a maple tree okay
08:50
those are our words for this lesson
08:53
let's go over the first main idea of
08:54
this lesson and that is grouping plants
08:56
by flowers
08:57
now the title or the introduction of
09:00
this lesson
09:01
i said scientists like to group living
09:04
and non-living organisms you know things
09:07
in nature
09:08
scientists study match the natural world
09:11
and as human beings we like to
09:15
group things we like to put things into
09:17
certain
09:18
classes or groups and of course that's
09:22
what's that's exactly what's going on
09:23
here
09:24
so scientists will take a look at all
09:26
different kinds of plants
09:27
and say well these plants are uh
09:31
plants that that create flowers or these
09:33
plants don't make flowers they do
09:35
something else
09:36
and so they give different names to
09:38
those different groupings
09:40
and that's how they will know very
09:41
quickly if that's your field of study
09:43
you can very quickly oh this is this
09:45
type of plant that's that type of plant
09:47
so how do they group plants by flowers
09:50
well of course it's very easy if a plant
09:52
if a plant creates a flower they call
09:55
those
09:56
flowering plants now that's not that's
09:58
not the scientific name
09:59
but that's an easy way for us to
10:01
remember most ordinary people
10:02
floored flowering plant flowering plants
10:05
obviously
10:06
have flowers flowers can make fruit and
10:09
seeds
10:10
so that's important all plants reproduce
10:14
so scientists will look at plants to see
10:16
how they reproduce and plants will
10:18
reproduce in different ways
10:20
so some plants will create flowers
10:24
to make seeds or fruits that will
10:27
have seeds inside them and that's how
10:30
those types of plants
10:32
that grouping of plants that's how they
10:34
reproduce
10:35
and keep growing for new generations
10:38
but not all plants do that other some
10:42
plants don't have flowers
10:43
for example pine trees and pine trees as
10:47
i said
10:47
is a type of conifer conifer trees
10:51
or conifer plants have no flowers they
10:54
don't have flowers
10:55
they have cones and i talked about cones
10:57
before it's hard to describe if i can't
10:59
show
11:00
you a picture so i didn't try but this
11:02
is a good picture of a cone here
11:04
they have cones and the cones contain
11:06
seeds so
11:07
you know i try to get to that before the
11:10
seeds are inside those
11:11
cones and squirrels and other animals
11:14
will try to get those seeds out
11:16
because they're very good for to eat
11:19
during the winter time
11:21
so of course the cone kind of protects
11:24
the seeds it makes it more difficult for
11:26
the animals to get to those seeds and
11:27
hopefully
11:28
the idea is that maybe the animal will
11:29
pick up that cone get some seeds but
11:32
other seeds
11:32
as the animal moves that cone other
11:34
seeds will be scattered
11:36
anyway so that's how conifers
11:40
pine trees and other trees like that
11:42
will
11:43
reproduce now there's another way too
11:46
other plants are mosses and ferns
11:50
they do not have flowers they don't even
11:53
have seeds
11:54
instead they use spores to reproduce
11:57
and spores are really small i didn't go
12:00
over that in the vocabulary but
12:01
spores are very small and they're very
12:03
light if there's a wind
12:05
the spores will distribute they'll
12:07
freely
12:08
uh disperse or spread out
12:11
with a with a slight wind and that's
12:14
important
12:15
because if the s'mores are small and
12:17
light they can easily spread over a
12:19
larger area
12:20
and the plant has a larger chance of
12:22
reproducing
12:23
or creating more plants over a wider
12:26
area
12:26
and that's how mosses and ferns will
12:29
reproduce
12:32
now another way to group plants is to
12:35
not look at how they reproduce
12:37
but to look at the physical
12:39
characteristics
12:40
the physical parts of the
12:44
organism whether it's a plant or an
12:46
animal in this case of course we're
12:47
talking about plants
12:49
so we can classify or group
12:52
plants by the physical characteristic of
12:55
the stem and remember the stem
12:57
we talked about this actually in book
12:59
three i hope you were with me with for
13:01
that
13:01
the stem is a part of a plant that
13:03
supports the body of the plants
13:06
okay so of course when we think of stem
13:08
we can think about a tree
13:10
and we don't we don't say the stem of a
13:12
tree we have a different word for it
13:14
so we call it a trunk so the tree
13:18
trunk don't say wow that tree has a
13:21
large stem
13:22
that sounds strange we don't say that
13:24
it's issan hale that's very strange
13:26
we would say that tree has a very large
13:29
trunk or
13:29
wow it's a really thick trunk now some
13:32
trees have long and slender trunks i'm
13:34
thinking of
13:35
aspen trees in colorado which are very
13:37
beautiful because
13:38
their trunks are white they have white
13:40
bark they're very beautiful trees
13:43
so anyway a tree will have a main stem
13:45
and they're called a
13:46
trunk so we call the stem a trunk
13:49
but tulips we do say tulips and many
13:52
other types of flowers like that
13:53
flowering plants
13:54
roses for example they have stems
13:58
and stems when you think of stem you
14:00
think it's not very
14:02
strong you can break it easily don't
14:04
don't go around breaking them just
14:05
just to test it but you know that's not
14:08
good
14:08
but if you're picking the flour you can
14:10
pick it because you can break the stem
14:12
very easily
14:13
you cannot break a tree trunk very
14:15
easily so
14:16
it's a big difference between a tree
14:18
trunk and a stem however the tree trunk
14:20
is a stem it's a type of stem okay
14:23
so a tulip has a soft green stem and
14:26
it's easy to break it off
14:28
and give to your mom or your girlfriend
14:31
if you have
14:32
a girlfriend and uh that's she will
14:35
appreciate that but be careful about
14:37
whose tulips you're picking right your
14:40
mom might get angry if you take the
14:41
tulips out of her garden
14:43
okay so anyway those are stems bush now
14:46
if you go outside perhaps around your
14:49
apartment complex or around your houses
14:51
in your neighborhood in the city you
14:54
will see many
14:55
bushes bushes have many wooden
14:58
woody stems or wooden stems and of
15:01
course bushes
15:02
you know if you look inside a bush you
15:04
can see a lot of stems going every which
15:06
way
15:06
and that's it's hard to to move through
15:09
a bush i don't recommend it of course
15:11
go around the bush but the reason it's
15:13
hard to move through a bush
15:14
is because they have a lot of stems
15:16
going every which way and of course some
15:17
of these are branches that's true
15:19
but it's hard to move through a bush and
15:21
many bushes will grow together
15:23
so their stems might cross each other
15:26
and it kind of forms a wall it's very
15:27
difficult to move through there
15:30
now another type of plant is a cactus
15:33
and a cactus
15:34
depending on the cactus it will have a
15:37
thick stem
15:38
that stores water this of course is a
15:40
picture of a saguaro
15:42
we talked about that in an earlier
15:43
lesson there are smaller
15:45
saguaro is a really big cactus there are
15:48
smaller cacti
15:49
or cactuses as well and um
15:52
they have uh they store water in their
15:55
stems because they live in the desert
15:58
and they need to have water all plants
16:00
need water so
16:01
cacti let me just
16:04
do this here quickly spell it for you
16:07
the plural of cactus is cacti
16:09
but a lot of people also just say cactus
16:12
says cacti is the old latin
16:16
plural of cactus but most people don't
16:20
know that they don't care and they just
16:21
put
16:22
scf yes at the end cactus says
16:25
same thing with octopi or octopuses
16:28
right so same thing but anyway cactuses
16:32
will have thick stems that store
16:34
water okay so we can group plants by
16:37
whether they make flowers how do they
16:39
reproduce we can also group
16:41
plants by their physical characteristics
16:44
and one way is by their stems
16:47
okay okay now it's time to do the
16:49
reading
16:50
so as usual i will read the reading out
16:52
loud
16:53
you guys can repeat after me or repeat
16:55
in your mind
16:57
think about the pronunciation of the
16:58
words and of course the meaning of the
17:00
words especially the ones
17:01
that we looked at in the vocabulary are
17:04
you ready
17:05
let's begin there are two types of
17:08
plants
17:10
one type has flowers and the other
17:13
does not flowering plants have flowers
17:18
flowers can make fruit and seeds
17:24
and orange trees flowers make oranges
17:28
the fruit contains seeds
17:32
flowers can make seeds without making
17:34
fruit
17:35
most vegetables have flowers
17:38
we sometimes eat these flowers
17:44
conifers have no flowers but they have
17:47
cones the cones contain seeds
17:51
the seeds fall out of the cones
17:55
they they the seeds they can become
17:59
a new conifer tree
18:04
another tree with no flowers is the
18:07
maple tree
18:08
it has unusual seeds they look like
18:12
wings the seeds can travel a long way
18:16
from the tree
18:20
mosses and ferns are unusual plants
18:24
they do not have flowers or seeds
18:27
they use spores to reproduce instead of
18:31
seeds mosses
18:34
often grow on wet rocks
18:38
ferns usually live in warm shady and wet
18:43
places okay so let's go over how this
18:47
reading passage is organized how is the
18:49
information
18:50
in the reading passage organized and
18:52
what we have here is
18:53
main idea and details so this is a very
18:56
common organizational
18:58
pattern you have a main idea and then
19:00
you support that main idea with details
19:02
what is the main idea the main idea is
19:05
that one
19:06
type of plant has flowers
19:09
and the other the other type of plant
19:12
you don't have to say that but it's
19:14
inferred it's already known type
19:17
of plant
19:20
does not does not what does not have
19:22
flowers so you don't have to repeat this
19:24
information
19:25
right in the same sentence it's just
19:27
kind of known so one type of plant has
19:29
flowers
19:30
the other does not have flowers okay
19:33
good
19:33
so what are the details the first detail
19:35
is that some plants have flowers and
19:38
fruit
19:39
fruit contains beep what does fruit
19:42
contain
19:43
again in the reading passage they talked
19:44
about oranges if you open an
19:46
orange you will find these little hard
19:49
bits don't eat them
19:50
and don't you know they can hurt your
19:51
teeth so don't bite them
19:53
right and you don't uh we don't of
19:55
course we don't eat them but you can use
19:57
them to plant a new orange tree and
19:59
that's a seed
20:00
same thing for apples so fruit contains
20:03
seeds seeds
20:07
okay so fruit contains seeds and that's
20:09
how those plants
20:10
will reproduce they are flower producing
20:13
or flowering
20:14
plants now
20:17
the next detail starts with a blank beep
20:20
right
20:20
blank have no flowers but they have
20:24
cones
20:25
which contain seeds and we talked about
20:28
those types of plants
20:29
right and i gave you an example a very
20:31
famous example are pine trees
20:34
pine trees are a type of conifer so
20:37
conifers because there are many types
20:40
of conifers oops yes conifers
20:43
conifers have no flowers but they have
20:46
cones
20:47
which contain seeds okay so that's how
20:50
they are different from
20:51
flowering plants now there's another
20:54
type of plant that the reading passage
20:56
mentioned
20:57
and they're two it's another type of
21:00
plant
21:00
but there's two examples of that type of
21:03
plant one was mosses
21:04
do you remember the other one the other
21:07
one of course was
21:08
ferns mosses and ferns
21:12
oops i'm sorry s ferns and that's an
21:15
e okay so ferns mosses and ferns
21:19
do not have flowers or seeds what do
21:21
they
21:22
use they don't use seeds remember
21:24
they're very fine they're very small
21:27
they can be carried by the wind very
21:28
easily there we call those
21:31
spores so they use spores s-p-o-r-e-s
21:36
spores to reproduce instead of
21:40
seeds so not seeds spores
21:43
so mosses and ferns don't have flowers
21:45
or seeds they use spores to reproduce
21:48
instead of seeds so this lesson was all
21:52
about
21:52
classifying or grouping different types
21:55
of plants and as i said at the beginning
21:57
this is what scientists do right a lot
22:00
of scientists especially
22:02
biologists will group and of course
22:05
other
22:05
types of scientists as well it's not
22:07
just biologists
22:08
but especially biologists will group
22:10
living organisms
22:12
into different groups and that's why you
22:13
have all sorts of species names
22:16
and families and different
22:19
groups but that's a whole you know
22:21
that's a very deep lesson
22:23
so this is a very important part of
22:25
science to group things together
22:26
in order to see because if you group
22:29
them together you can kind of get a
22:30
better idea about
22:32
how they work how they reproduce how
22:34
they live how they evolved
22:37
and so you develop a deeper
22:40
understanding about these living
22:42
organisms when you do this
22:44
so grouping classifying is a very common
22:47
technique in science and as we've seen
22:49
scientists will group plants according
22:51
to different characteristics how do they
22:53
reproduce
22:54
and what types of physical
22:56
characteristics in this case
22:58
stems do different types of plants have
23:01
so you could basically do this same idea
23:05
with almost
23:05
any living organism or groups of living
23:08
organisms
23:09
you can classify them according to how
23:12
they reproduce
23:13
or their physical characteristics or
23:15
maybe some other types of things
23:17
that they do or have so
23:20
in this lesson we again we talked about
23:22
plants how to classify the different
23:24
types
23:25
and we learned we went over some
23:27
interesting vocabulary i hope and some
23:29
interesting ideas about plants i hope
23:31
you've learned a lot
23:32
as always thank you for studying with me
23:35
and we'll hope to see you
23:36
in the next lesson take care everybody
23:42
[Music]
23:48
bye-bye
24:00
you
