hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading i'm brian stewart and we're
looking at social studies book 3
lesson 12 today and lesson 12 we're
talking about countries
and trade goods this is a little bit of
a difficult subject but it's an
interesting subject how do countries
trade goods with each other in this unit
you will discover how countries trade
and why countries specialize
in certain goods or services
okay let's start with the vocabulary the
first word is
trade we saw that in the introduction
to this lesson trade what does trade
mean
well trade very simply means you have
something
i want and i have something you want
so if the items are similar in value
we can just trade right if you have two
gumballs
and i have one lollipop and you don't
really want the gumballs but you want my
lollipop
and i want your gum i don't really want
my lollipop
we can trade i give you a lollipop you
give me the gumballs
good trade right that's trade to and
but on a bigger scale right to trade
means to buy and sell
goods and services so think about much
bigger scale a very large scale like a
country making
all sorts of goods and services
we talked about goods and services in a
previous lesson
but a country offers or makes all types
of goods and services
another country might want those goods
and services
of course they produce their own goods
and services
that the other country might want so
they trade
these things with each other and that's
what we mean
by trade okay
barter barter is a type
of trading but barter means that you
trade something without
money now usually you know i gave the
example of the lollipop and the gumballs
that is an example of bartering because
no money is involved we're just
trading but we don't worry about money
however what is the real cost of the two
gumballs on the lollipop are they really
equal
maybe not but to make it equal we might
say well the lollipop is worth
25 cents and the two gumballs they're
worth
20 cents so there's a difference of 5
cents
but that might not mean anything to you
and i we don't carry
just 5 cents but for countries
that are trading goods and services they
do
care about how much exactly their goods
or
services are worth so they will assign
money
to that and money will be used for the
trade
but if it's not important or you think
the items are similar value
then you can just trade and that's
called barter
a long time ago before people really
depended on money
they just used barter they would trade a
donkey
for some wheat right and they would kind
of figure out how much the donkey is
worth in terms of wheat
and they would barter with each other so
barter
is a type of trade but barter does not
use
money okay
specialize what are you good at
are you good at doing something maybe
you have a talent for
making a good or doing some kind of
service if you focus your talents and
develop your skills
in doing that thing then you are
specializing
in that thing now it's very
common that we use the word in
after specialized you specialize in
something and specialize to choose and
focus on one kind of crop
or product but it also means to
specialize
on a certain type of skill if you're
very good
with computers and you like you learn
how to code
computers you might specialize in
computer programming that is your
specialty
specialty is a noun what is your
specialty special t
specialty which is a noun and you could
say
my specialty is programming computers
okay his specialty is
practicing law for example or a doctor
specializes
in medicine farmers might specialize
in growing one type of crop or plant
some farmers might specialize in growing
corn
some farmers might specialize in growing
wheat
because they learn that plant they
learn all about it and they devote all
their efforts to it
so they can specialize in that certain
plant or in that certain field so what
will you specialize in
when you get older okay
rubber that's an interesting picture for
rubber of course
rubber if you have a small ball that you
can push
and you can bounce and it bounces off
the floor the
ball is probably made out of rubber
the bottom of your shoes if you have
tennis shoes
might be rubber it might be a more
high-tech
material nowadays but rubber is used for
a lot of different things
the tires on your car your family's car
those are made of rubber because rubber
what is rubber
it's a stretchy material what does
stretchy mean
stretchy means you can stretch it right
if you pull it on
either side it moves a little bit you
have some
uh flexibility so it's a stretchy
material
that is used to make things like tires
and
boots that's another good example do you
have a pair of
rain boots they are made of rubber right
they protect your feet
from the rain so that's rubber
next we have wheat i mentioned this
before
wheat is a grain that's very that's
grown in a lot of countries
and it's a grain used for making flour
so if you like pancakes
you are eating wheat that has been
ground
into a white powder we call flour
sometimes it's white sometimes it's
brown
depends on how they how they make it but
it's uh the wheat is grown in the fields
very similar to rice right rice is
another
food that we eat and by the way wheat
rice corn we call these things
staples because they are the basic
food for many people around the world
they're like a staple
food rice wheat corn
uh many other types of food that farmers
will grow we call those the staples
right
because they kind of form the base the
basis of
a diet for people around the world okay
port what is a port well you've heard of
airport right
an airport is where airplanes come and
fly that's where the airports gather
right
they they land there and they take off
there but there's also a similar place
for ships and in fact port is a much
older word than airport right ports have
been around for
thousands of years for as long as human
beings
have made ships and they carry goods by
ship to a certain place
that place that becomes convenient for
the ships to come in
and to stay and then to leave that place
is called a port
and a por and cities and towns and
villages grow up around it well villages
towns and cities will grow from ports
because they become very
busy places for human activity so a port
is a city
town or other place where ships can
enter
and leave it's usually a natural
nice area for ships deep water it's
protected from big waves
these places become ports san francisco
is an important port in america there's
another important port at incheon right
that's an important port as well
so um basically it's just a place for
ships to come in and leave and like i
said port has been around for such a
long time
that when the invention of airplanes
came to be they thought
well what should we call the place where
airplanes come and leave well let's call
it an
airport okay so they used an old word
for a new technology and that happens a
lot okay so that's port
dollar dollar is the name of money used
in the united states but also many
other countries as well other countries
also use
dollars so it's not just the united
states
other countries like australia they use
the dollar canada uses a dollar
and many other countries also use
dollars
as the name of their money
and the united states currency though is
used very
commonly around the world because it's
kind of like a standard now
so many people will convert their
national currency into dollars
and then maybe go to another country and
use the dollars there
it's very useful if you travel or for
trade
okay those are our vocabulary words
for today
okay let's go over the two main ideas in
this lesson the first
idea is the idea about trading with
other
countries and i talked about this a
little bit before countries will trade
with each other
some country might have certain goods
and services
another country might have different
goods and services so they want to trade
with each other so let's take a look at
some examples
of trade first of all over on the left
side
on the bottom we see the united states
and this is a world map right we can see
most of the countries in the world
on this map way over on the left we see
the united states and the arrow pointing
to it
and it says the united states trades
wheat
with other countries why does the united
states
trade wheat because farmers in the
united states
specialize remember they specialize they
focus their efforts
in growing wheat in the united states
especially in the middle part
of the united states very wide very wide
and
flat land so a lot of farming land
and if you go there you can see huge
farms as far as you can see and farmers
will grow wheat
of course they also grow corn corn is
very common in the midwest
and we call it the midwest or the middle
of the country it's a very
a lot of agriculture a lot of farming
goes on
in the middle of the united states wheat
is a traditional crop
that western people will grow so they
have specialized in growing wheat so
united states has a lot of wheat
and they have a lot of land to grow
wheat
now down here in central america
costa rica which is where right down
there right the arrows pointing to it
costa rica in central america
it's very hot and humid they don't have
snow
but it's very good for growing many
other types of crops
like bananas costa rica trades bananas
with other countries
their climate hot and humid and it's
they live their most of their land is
like jungle banana trees grow
very well there so do coconut trees and
mango trees right
so they can grow a lot of fruit it's
never winter
so they can grow fruit all year long so
costa rica trades bananas with other
countries farmers in costa rica
specialize
in growing bananas because of their
climate and because
of the environment in costa rica
now way over on the other side of the
world way over here
in malaysia and malaysia is an
interesting country because it's here
and but it's also here right the country
is like split
it's like two parts right so it's
interesting
malaysia trades rubber now malaysia is
also in a hot
and humid climate and there's a lot of
jungle there but in their jungle they
have
rubber trees and that's a very important
discovery right they have these trees
that that will
you can get rubber from them and so they
specialize
in growing rubber farmers in malaysia
specialize in growing rubber this is
very important in world war
ii because many countries in europe
needed rubber
so they would go to these countries here
and
try to get rubber trade for rubber
because rubber was very important
for tires and other machinery that they
were using in world war
ii so that's very interesting some
countries might have
certain resources that other countries
want because you can't really grow
rubber in europe the climate's not good
for that okay
so european countries and of course
other countries nowadays
will trade with malaysia to get rubber
so as we can see people or
countries cannot always get what they
need
they don't live in the right place right
their environment doesn't support
growing wheat or maybe
their environment doesn't support
growing bananas or rubber
so they can get what they want or they
need
by trading right so if america needs
rubber
they will trade with malaysia america
has wheat
malaysia doesn't grow a lot of wheat so
they can trade
wheat goes to malaysia rubber comes back
to the united states and that's trade
that's very similar to this picture here
international
trade and i use the example of america
and malaysia but of course every country
does it two very important
trading partners in the world today are
america
and china china produces a lot of goods
china can produce goods cheaply because
the wages
the amount of money that factory workers
make
is not high so they can produce goods
for
a little money in america the wages are
very high so it's expensive
to produce goods in factories in america
so america
doesn't want to buy expensive goods that
are made
in america they would prefer to buy
cheap goods
from china so they might import those
goods now here we have
a couple of important words import and
export
so import work importing goods import
means to
buy goods or services from sellers in
other countries so if you're in america
and you want a good
but it's too expensive in america or
maybe it's not available
in america they don't make it there then
you might
want to buy it from another country but
it that good
has to be imported sent from one country
to another country for selling in that
country
so china will import good well i'm sorry
china will export goods i'm sorry about
that export
so china exports and america imports
okay that's a little confusing right so
america will import because they're
receiving
the good china is exporting
because they are sending the good so
think about it this way
import is similar to receive or i'll
make it simple
import is similar to get export
is similar to
i'm going to say give but it's not
really give maybe send is better you
don't really give it
if you give it you don't get any money
for it but you're sending it you're
giving it to another country
that is exporting if you're importing
you're
getting it you're receiving it that's
import
so import export okay very simple
so import means to buy goods or services
from sellers in other countries
and export means to sell goods
give or send goods to or services to
people
in another country okay so i try to keep
it simple
import is like get export is like give
but of course give don't
don't say give exactly because give is
just no money you're just giving it
you're a nice person
you just give it they don't just give it
they sell it
or they send it to another person for
money okay but it's similar to give
okay
now it's time for the reading so let's
do the reading and as usual
read along with me either out loud or in
your mind
practice the pronunciation and let's
focus on the words that we learned
are you ready let's begin
goods from farms and factories
move all over the world
this is because all countries trade
and barter with each other to get things
which they do not have
for example the us specializes
in growing wheat
but it does not have enough rubber
malaysia specializes in rubber
but it does not have enough wheat
farmers in the u.s sell their wheat
to the customers in malaysia
sell you could also say export
right because they're selling or they're
giving or they're
sending their wheat farmers in malaysia
sell their rubber to the customers in
the u.s okay
now what's the opposite the opposite
would be uh
farmers in the u.s import
or buy rubber from
malaysia that would be the opposite okay
good
the two countries depend on each other
for these goods
and that's important depend on someone
we didn't talk about that in the
vocabulary that's a very important word
when you support somebody you are
they depend on you right and we all
depend on each other
we can't produce everything we need by
ourselves
that would be a very difficult life so
we depend on other people
to produce the goods and the services
that we need
to live a happy successful life
so we depend on each other very
important idea
goods are shipped to ports in the
countries
where they are bought and sold by
people every year
the u.s spends millions of dollars
trading for goods that it needs for its
people
to live happy and healthy lives
the same is true for other countries
like malaysia okay that's our reading
for this lesson
let's take a look at how the reading is
organized
and of course we go over many different
reading skills
in this case we have cause and effect
so there's a cause there's a situation
that
results in some effect
right a situation produces
an effect so that's what we have here
for example
we have two causes on the left side and
the the effects from those causes
are on the right side and they're
connected by the arrow so what is the
cause
what is the condition first the first
one is
the us does not have enough what in the
reading we saw that the u.s does not
have
you know they grow a lot of wheat they
specialize in growing wheat but they
don't have enough of what they don't
have enough of
rubber right and rubber is needed to
make tires
and boots and other parts for machines
that are flexible
so the us does not have enough rubber
so that's the cause what did they do
what is the effect of that
what results from that condition the
result is that people in the
u.s beep rubber from farmers in malaysia
now the reading didn't specifically say
this but
we can think about what were the words
we learned and
what was one of the things that i
highlighted
in the ideas for this lesson do you
remember that
chart that we looked at import and
export
ah we need a word from that chart to
fill in the blank here
so people in the us they
they buy they get what's another word
forget that i went over
import right okay so people in the u.s
import i know it didn't say it in the
reading
but we have to put the ideas together
right so
people in the u.s import rubber from
farmers in malaysia you could also say
buy
of course buy people in the us buy
rubber
from farmers in malaysia because
malaysia
beep in rubber remember we talked about
uh malaysia has jungle they have a lot
of rubber trees
so their farmers focus their efforts on
growing rubber that means they
specialize
in rubber so they specialize specialize
they specialize in rubber
good so that's one cause
us doesn't have enough rubber so they
import rubber from farmers in malaysia
because malaysia
oh sorry specializes oops
specializes in rubber remember malaysia
is a singular noun
it's singular singular
so we must put an s on the verb
singular noun s on the verb not always
but
most of the time okay so malaysia
specializes
in rubber good next one
malaysia does not have enough so
malaysia has a lot of rubber but they
don't have enough what
remember from the reading it said
malaysia does not have enough
wheat so that's
the cause we or that's the condition
that creates an effect so it's a cause
malaysia does not have enough wheat
so what is the result of that situation
the result of that situation the effect
is
people in malaysia beep wheat well of
course that's the same as above right
it's
it's parallel it's the same idea so we
put import here
import so they will import wheat
from farmers in the u.s of course you
can also say buy
buy so they buy wheat from farmers they
import
wheat from farmers in the u.s because
the u.s
what the u.s again we think of the u.s
even though the united states
has many states we think of it as one
country so it's a singular noun
we say it specializes specializes we
need the s
right because again the u.s yes i know
it's it's
the united states there are 50 states
but it's one country
so we think of it as a singular noun so
the united states specializes not
specialized
specializes in growing wheat okay
so that's the cause and that's the
effect and again of course
we talked about import or buy now the
opposite remember of import or buy is
export
so another sentence we could make about
this situation is that
people in malaysia export rubber
to the u.s and farmers in the u.s
export wheat to malaysia right so
import and export are opposites right
and they're very closely related
words okay well that's very interesting
i know this
subject is a little uh difficult right
but it's uh interesting
to think about how do you get the goods
and maybe services that you need for
your life look around your room
what things were were made in your home
country
maybe there are many things in your room
that were uh
imported from other countries and maybe
you
of course you can go down the store and
buy them or your mom or your dad can
order them online and they come to your
house but the whole world
is specializing in different things and
people everywhere have certain abilities
and certain talents so they will
specialize in making
the things that they're good at and then
they can sell them all around the world
so think about that when you grow up
maybe you will specialize
in producing some type of good or in
providing some type of service
and you can sell those things to anybody
in the world and that's all about
import and export trade okay
interesting lesson today i hope you
learned a lot some interesting words i
hope they weren't too difficult for you
so but interesting nonetheless thanks
for studying with me and we'll see you
in the next lesson
take care

hello everybody
00:09
welcome back to american textbook
00:11
reading i'm brian stewart and we're
00:13
looking at social studies book 3
00:15
lesson 12 today and lesson 12 we're
00:18
talking about countries
00:20
and trade goods this is a little bit of
00:23
a difficult subject but it's an
00:25
interesting subject how do countries
00:28
trade goods with each other in this unit
00:32
you will discover how countries trade
00:35
and why countries specialize
00:38
in certain goods or services
00:46
okay let's start with the vocabulary the
00:49
first word is
00:50
trade we saw that in the introduction
00:53
to this lesson trade what does trade
00:56
mean
00:57
well trade very simply means you have
01:00
something
01:01
i want and i have something you want
01:05
so if the items are similar in value
01:08
we can just trade right if you have two
01:11
gumballs
01:13
and i have one lollipop and you don't
01:16
really want the gumballs but you want my
01:18
lollipop
01:19
and i want your gum i don't really want
01:21
my lollipop
01:22
we can trade i give you a lollipop you
01:25
give me the gumballs
01:26
good trade right that's trade to and
01:30
but on a bigger scale right to trade
01:32
means to buy and sell
01:34
goods and services so think about much
01:37
bigger scale a very large scale like a
01:40
country making
01:41
all sorts of goods and services
01:45
we talked about goods and services in a
01:46
previous lesson
01:48
but a country offers or makes all types
01:50
of goods and services
01:52
another country might want those goods
01:54
and services
01:55
of course they produce their own goods
01:58
and services
01:59
that the other country might want so
02:01
they trade
02:02
these things with each other and that's
02:05
what we mean
02:06
by trade okay
02:10
barter barter is a type
02:13
of trading but barter means that you
02:16
trade something without
02:18
money now usually you know i gave the
02:20
example of the lollipop and the gumballs
02:22
that is an example of bartering because
02:25
no money is involved we're just
02:28
trading but we don't worry about money
02:32
however what is the real cost of the two
02:35
gumballs on the lollipop are they really
02:37
equal
02:39
maybe not but to make it equal we might
02:42
say well the lollipop is worth
02:44
25 cents and the two gumballs they're
02:47
worth
02:48
20 cents so there's a difference of 5
02:50
cents
02:51
but that might not mean anything to you
02:53
and i we don't carry
02:55
just 5 cents but for countries
02:58
that are trading goods and services they
03:00
do
03:01
care about how much exactly their goods
03:04
or
03:05
services are worth so they will assign
03:07
money
03:08
to that and money will be used for the
03:10
trade
03:11
but if it's not important or you think
03:12
the items are similar value
03:15
then you can just trade and that's
03:16
called barter
03:18
a long time ago before people really
03:21
depended on money
03:22
they just used barter they would trade a
03:25
donkey
03:26
for some wheat right and they would kind
03:28
of figure out how much the donkey is
03:30
worth in terms of wheat
03:32
and they would barter with each other so
03:34
barter
03:35
is a type of trade but barter does not
03:38
use
03:39
money okay
03:42
specialize what are you good at
03:46
are you good at doing something maybe
03:49
you have a talent for
03:50
making a good or doing some kind of
03:53
service if you focus your talents and
03:57
develop your skills
03:59
in doing that thing then you are
04:02
specializing
04:03
in that thing now it's very
04:06
common that we use the word in
04:10
after specialized you specialize in
04:13
something and specialize to choose and
04:15
focus on one kind of crop
04:17
or product but it also means to
04:19
specialize
04:20
on a certain type of skill if you're
04:23
very good
04:24
with computers and you like you learn
04:27
how to code
04:28
computers you might specialize in
04:31
computer programming that is your
04:33
specialty
04:35
specialty is a noun what is your
04:38
specialty special t
04:42
specialty which is a noun and you could
04:44
say
04:45
my specialty is programming computers
04:49
okay his specialty is
04:53
practicing law for example or a doctor
04:57
specializes
04:58
in medicine farmers might specialize
05:02
in growing one type of crop or plant
05:05
some farmers might specialize in growing
05:07
corn
05:08
some farmers might specialize in growing
05:11
wheat
05:12
because they learn that plant they
05:15
learn all about it and they devote all
05:17
their efforts to it
05:18
so they can specialize in that certain
05:22
plant or in that certain field so what
05:24
will you specialize in
05:26
when you get older okay
05:29
rubber that's an interesting picture for
05:31
rubber of course
05:33
rubber if you have a small ball that you
05:35
can push
05:36
and you can bounce and it bounces off
05:38
the floor the
05:40
ball is probably made out of rubber
05:43
the bottom of your shoes if you have
05:45
tennis shoes
05:47
might be rubber it might be a more
05:49
high-tech
05:50
material nowadays but rubber is used for
05:53
a lot of different things
05:54
the tires on your car your family's car
05:58
those are made of rubber because rubber
06:00
what is rubber
06:01
it's a stretchy material what does
06:03
stretchy mean
06:05
stretchy means you can stretch it right
06:07
if you pull it on
06:08
either side it moves a little bit you
06:11
have some
06:12
uh flexibility so it's a stretchy
06:16
material
06:16
that is used to make things like tires
06:19
and
06:20
boots that's another good example do you
06:22
have a pair of
06:23
rain boots they are made of rubber right
06:26
they protect your feet
06:28
from the rain so that's rubber
06:31
next we have wheat i mentioned this
06:34
before
06:35
wheat is a grain that's very that's
06:37
grown in a lot of countries
06:40
and it's a grain used for making flour
06:42
so if you like pancakes
06:45
you are eating wheat that has been
06:47
ground
06:48
into a white powder we call flour
06:51
sometimes it's white sometimes it's
06:53
brown
06:53
depends on how they how they make it but
06:56
it's uh the wheat is grown in the fields
06:59
very similar to rice right rice is
07:02
another
07:03
food that we eat and by the way wheat
07:06
rice corn we call these things
07:10
staples because they are the basic
07:14
food for many people around the world
07:17
they're like a staple
07:18
food rice wheat corn
07:21
uh many other types of food that farmers
07:24
will grow we call those the staples
07:26
right
07:26
because they kind of form the base the
07:29
basis of
07:30
a diet for people around the world okay
07:35
port what is a port well you've heard of
07:37
airport right
07:38
an airport is where airplanes come and
07:41
fly that's where the airports gather
07:42
right
07:43
they they land there and they take off
07:45
there but there's also a similar place
07:48
for ships and in fact port is a much
07:52
older word than airport right ports have
07:55
been around for
07:56
thousands of years for as long as human
07:59
beings
07:59
have made ships and they carry goods by
08:03
ship to a certain place
08:04
that place that becomes convenient for
08:07
the ships to come in
08:08
and to stay and then to leave that place
08:11
is called a port
08:12
and a por and cities and towns and
08:14
villages grow up around it well villages
08:17
towns and cities will grow from ports
08:20
because they become very
08:21
busy places for human activity so a port
08:25
is a city
08:26
town or other place where ships can
08:28
enter
08:29
and leave it's usually a natural
08:32
nice area for ships deep water it's
08:35
protected from big waves
08:37
these places become ports san francisco
08:40
is an important port in america there's
08:44
another important port at incheon right
08:46
that's an important port as well
08:49
so um basically it's just a place for
08:53
ships to come in and leave and like i
08:55
said port has been around for such a
08:56
long time
08:57
that when the invention of airplanes
09:00
came to be they thought
09:01
well what should we call the place where
09:02
airplanes come and leave well let's call
09:04
it an
09:05
airport okay so they used an old word
09:08
for a new technology and that happens a
09:10
lot okay so that's port
09:14
dollar dollar is the name of money used
09:17
in the united states but also many
09:19
other countries as well other countries
09:22
also use
09:23
dollars so it's not just the united
09:26
states
09:26
other countries like australia they use
09:28
the dollar canada uses a dollar
09:31
and many other countries also use
09:33
dollars
09:34
as the name of their money
09:37
and the united states currency though is
09:41
used very
09:42
commonly around the world because it's
09:43
kind of like a standard now
09:45
so many people will convert their
09:48
national currency into dollars
09:50
and then maybe go to another country and
09:52
use the dollars there
09:53
it's very useful if you travel or for
09:56
trade
09:57
okay those are our vocabulary words
10:00
for today
10:06
okay let's go over the two main ideas in
10:08
this lesson the first
10:09
idea is the idea about trading with
10:13
other
10:13
countries and i talked about this a
10:15
little bit before countries will trade
10:17
with each other
10:18
some country might have certain goods
10:21
and services
10:21
another country might have different
10:23
goods and services so they want to trade
10:26
with each other so let's take a look at
10:28
some examples
10:29
of trade first of all over on the left
10:32
side
10:32
on the bottom we see the united states
10:35
and this is a world map right we can see
10:36
most of the countries in the world
10:38
on this map way over on the left we see
10:41
the united states and the arrow pointing
10:43
to it
10:44
and it says the united states trades
10:46
wheat
10:47
with other countries why does the united
10:49
states
10:50
trade wheat because farmers in the
10:53
united states
10:54
specialize remember they specialize they
10:57
focus their efforts
10:59
in growing wheat in the united states
11:02
especially in the middle part
11:04
of the united states very wide very wide
11:08
and
11:08
flat land so a lot of farming land
11:12
and if you go there you can see huge
11:15
farms as far as you can see and farmers
11:18
will grow wheat
11:18
of course they also grow corn corn is
11:20
very common in the midwest
11:23
and we call it the midwest or the middle
11:24
of the country it's a very
11:27
a lot of agriculture a lot of farming
11:30
goes on
11:30
in the middle of the united states wheat
11:33
is a traditional crop
11:35
that western people will grow so they
11:38
have specialized in growing wheat so
11:40
united states has a lot of wheat
11:42
and they have a lot of land to grow
11:44
wheat
11:45
now down here in central america
11:49
costa rica which is where right down
11:51
there right the arrows pointing to it
11:53
costa rica in central america
11:56
it's very hot and humid they don't have
11:59
snow
11:59
but it's very good for growing many
12:02
other types of crops
12:04
like bananas costa rica trades bananas
12:07
with other countries
12:09
their climate hot and humid and it's
12:12
they live their most of their land is
12:14
like jungle banana trees grow
12:16
very well there so do coconut trees and
12:19
mango trees right
12:20
so they can grow a lot of fruit it's
12:22
never winter
12:24
so they can grow fruit all year long so
12:27
costa rica trades bananas with other
12:30
countries farmers in costa rica
12:33
specialize
12:34
in growing bananas because of their
12:36
climate and because
12:38
of the environment in costa rica
12:42
now way over on the other side of the
12:44
world way over here
12:45
in malaysia and malaysia is an
12:48
interesting country because it's here
12:51
and but it's also here right the country
12:53
is like split
12:54
it's like two parts right so it's
12:56
interesting
12:57
malaysia trades rubber now malaysia is
13:00
also in a hot
13:01
and humid climate and there's a lot of
13:04
jungle there but in their jungle they
13:06
have
13:07
rubber trees and that's a very important
13:10
discovery right they have these trees
13:12
that that will
13:13
you can get rubber from them and so they
13:16
specialize
13:18
in growing rubber farmers in malaysia
13:22
specialize in growing rubber this is
13:25
very important in world war
13:26
ii because many countries in europe
13:29
needed rubber
13:30
so they would go to these countries here
13:33
and
13:33
try to get rubber trade for rubber
13:36
because rubber was very important
13:38
for tires and other machinery that they
13:41
were using in world war
13:42
ii so that's very interesting some
13:45
countries might have
13:46
certain resources that other countries
13:49
want because you can't really grow
13:50
rubber in europe the climate's not good
13:53
for that okay
13:54
so european countries and of course
13:56
other countries nowadays
13:57
will trade with malaysia to get rubber
14:01
so as we can see people or
14:04
countries cannot always get what they
14:06
need
14:07
they don't live in the right place right
14:10
their environment doesn't support
14:12
growing wheat or maybe
14:14
their environment doesn't support
14:16
growing bananas or rubber
14:18
so they can get what they want or they
14:20
need
14:21
by trading right so if america needs
14:24
rubber
14:25
they will trade with malaysia america
14:28
has wheat
14:29
malaysia doesn't grow a lot of wheat so
14:31
they can trade
14:32
wheat goes to malaysia rubber comes back
14:36
to the united states and that's trade
14:41
that's very similar to this picture here
14:43
international
14:44
trade and i use the example of america
14:48
and malaysia but of course every country
14:50
does it two very important
14:52
trading partners in the world today are
14:54
america
14:55
and china china produces a lot of goods
15:00
china can produce goods cheaply because
15:03
the wages
15:04
the amount of money that factory workers
15:07
make
15:07
is not high so they can produce goods
15:10
for
15:11
a little money in america the wages are
15:14
very high so it's expensive
15:16
to produce goods in factories in america
15:18
so america
15:19
doesn't want to buy expensive goods that
15:22
are made
15:22
in america they would prefer to buy
15:25
cheap goods
15:26
from china so they might import those
15:29
goods now here we have
15:30
a couple of important words import and
15:33
export
15:35
so import work importing goods import
15:38
means to
15:38
buy goods or services from sellers in
15:42
other countries so if you're in america
15:45
and you want a good
15:46
but it's too expensive in america or
15:48
maybe it's not available
15:50
in america they don't make it there then
15:52
you might
15:53
want to buy it from another country but
15:55
it that good
15:57
has to be imported sent from one country
16:00
to another country for selling in that
16:03
country
16:04
so china will import good well i'm sorry
16:08
china will export goods i'm sorry about
16:10
that export
16:12
so china exports and america imports
16:16
okay that's a little confusing right so
16:19
america will import because they're
16:21
receiving
16:22
the good china is exporting
16:25
because they are sending the good so
16:27
think about it this way
16:29
import is similar to receive or i'll
16:33
make it simple
16:34
import is similar to get export
16:40
is similar to
16:43
i'm going to say give but it's not
16:45
really give maybe send is better you
16:47
don't really give it
16:47
if you give it you don't get any money
16:49
for it but you're sending it you're
16:51
giving it to another country
16:53
that is exporting if you're importing
16:55
you're
16:56
getting it you're receiving it that's
16:59
import
17:00
so import export okay very simple
17:04
so import means to buy goods or services
17:06
from sellers in other countries
17:08
and export means to sell goods
17:11
give or send goods to or services to
17:14
people
17:15
in another country okay so i try to keep
17:18
it simple
17:19
import is like get export is like give
17:21
but of course give don't
17:22
don't say give exactly because give is
17:25
just no money you're just giving it
17:26
you're a nice person
17:27
you just give it they don't just give it
17:29
they sell it
17:30
or they send it to another person for
17:33
money okay but it's similar to give
17:35
okay
17:40
now it's time for the reading so let's
17:41
do the reading and as usual
17:44
read along with me either out loud or in
17:46
your mind
17:47
practice the pronunciation and let's
17:49
focus on the words that we learned
17:51
are you ready let's begin
17:55
goods from farms and factories
17:58
move all over the world
18:01
this is because all countries trade
18:05
and barter with each other to get things
18:09
which they do not have
18:13
for example the us specializes
18:18
in growing wheat
18:21
but it does not have enough rubber
18:25
malaysia specializes in rubber
18:28
but it does not have enough wheat
18:33
farmers in the u.s sell their wheat
18:37
to the customers in malaysia
18:41
sell you could also say export
18:44
right because they're selling or they're
18:46
giving or they're
18:47
sending their wheat farmers in malaysia
18:51
sell their rubber to the customers in
18:54
the u.s okay
18:56
now what's the opposite the opposite
18:58
would be uh
19:00
farmers in the u.s import
19:03
or buy rubber from
19:06
malaysia that would be the opposite okay
19:09
good
19:10
the two countries depend on each other
19:13
for these goods
19:14
and that's important depend on someone
19:18
we didn't talk about that in the
19:19
vocabulary that's a very important word
19:22
when you support somebody you are
19:25
they depend on you right and we all
19:27
depend on each other
19:29
we can't produce everything we need by
19:31
ourselves
19:32
that would be a very difficult life so
19:35
we depend on other people
19:37
to produce the goods and the services
19:40
that we need
19:41
to live a happy successful life
19:44
so we depend on each other very
19:47
important idea
19:50
goods are shipped to ports in the
19:52
countries
19:53
where they are bought and sold by
19:56
people every year
20:00
the u.s spends millions of dollars
20:03
trading for goods that it needs for its
20:07
people
20:07
to live happy and healthy lives
20:11
the same is true for other countries
20:14
like malaysia okay that's our reading
20:18
for this lesson
20:21
let's take a look at how the reading is
20:23
organized
20:24
and of course we go over many different
20:26
reading skills
20:27
in this case we have cause and effect
20:30
so there's a cause there's a situation
20:33
that
20:34
results in some effect
20:37
right a situation produces
20:41
an effect so that's what we have here
20:43
for example
20:44
we have two causes on the left side and
20:47
the the effects from those causes
20:49
are on the right side and they're
20:51
connected by the arrow so what is the
20:53
cause
20:53
what is the condition first the first
20:56
one is
20:57
the us does not have enough what in the
21:00
reading we saw that the u.s does not
21:01
have
21:02
you know they grow a lot of wheat they
21:03
specialize in growing wheat but they
21:06
don't have enough of what they don't
21:08
have enough of
21:09
rubber right and rubber is needed to
21:12
make tires
21:13
and boots and other parts for machines
21:16
that are flexible
21:18
so the us does not have enough rubber
21:21
so that's the cause what did they do
21:23
what is the effect of that
21:25
what results from that condition the
21:28
result is that people in the
21:30
u.s beep rubber from farmers in malaysia
21:34
now the reading didn't specifically say
21:37
this but
21:38
we can think about what were the words
21:40
we learned and
21:41
what was one of the things that i
21:43
highlighted
21:44
in the ideas for this lesson do you
21:46
remember that
21:47
chart that we looked at import and
21:49
export
21:50
ah we need a word from that chart to
21:53
fill in the blank here
21:54
so people in the us they
21:58
they buy they get what's another word
22:01
forget that i went over
22:02
import right okay so people in the u.s
22:06
import i know it didn't say it in the
22:09
reading
22:09
but we have to put the ideas together
22:12
right so
22:13
people in the u.s import rubber from
22:16
farmers in malaysia you could also say
22:19
buy
22:19
of course buy people in the us buy
22:22
rubber
22:23
from farmers in malaysia because
22:25
malaysia
22:26
beep in rubber remember we talked about
22:29
uh malaysia has jungle they have a lot
22:32
of rubber trees
22:33
so their farmers focus their efforts on
22:36
growing rubber that means they
22:38
specialize
22:40
in rubber so they specialize specialize
22:45
they specialize in rubber
22:48
good so that's one cause
22:52
us doesn't have enough rubber so they
22:54
import rubber from farmers in malaysia
22:56
because malaysia
22:57
oh sorry specializes oops
23:01
specializes in rubber remember malaysia
23:03
is a singular noun
23:05
it's singular singular
23:09
so we must put an s on the verb
23:12
singular noun s on the verb not always
23:15
but
23:15
most of the time okay so malaysia
23:18
specializes
23:20
in rubber good next one
23:23
malaysia does not have enough so
23:26
malaysia has a lot of rubber but they
23:28
don't have enough what
23:29
remember from the reading it said
23:31
malaysia does not have enough
23:33
wheat so that's
23:36
the cause we or that's the condition
23:40
that creates an effect so it's a cause
23:42
malaysia does not have enough wheat
23:44
so what is the result of that situation
23:47
the result of that situation the effect
23:50
is
23:51
people in malaysia beep wheat well of
23:53
course that's the same as above right
23:55
it's
23:55
it's parallel it's the same idea so we
23:58
put import here
23:59
import so they will import wheat
24:03
from farmers in the u.s of course you
24:04
can also say buy
24:06
buy so they buy wheat from farmers they
24:09
import
24:10
wheat from farmers in the u.s because
24:12
the u.s
24:13
what the u.s again we think of the u.s
24:15
even though the united states
24:17
has many states we think of it as one
24:19
country so it's a singular noun
24:21
we say it specializes specializes we
24:27
need the s
24:28
right because again the u.s yes i know
24:31
it's it's
24:32
the united states there are 50 states
24:34
but it's one country
24:35
so we think of it as a singular noun so
24:38
the united states specializes not
24:42
specialized
24:42
specializes in growing wheat okay
24:46
so that's the cause and that's the
24:47
effect and again of course
24:49
we talked about import or buy now the
24:51
opposite remember of import or buy is
24:53
export
24:54
so another sentence we could make about
24:56
this situation is that
24:58
people in malaysia export rubber
25:01
to the u.s and farmers in the u.s
25:04
export wheat to malaysia right so
25:08
import and export are opposites right
25:10
and they're very closely related
25:12
words okay well that's very interesting
25:15
i know this
25:16
subject is a little uh difficult right
25:19
but it's uh interesting
25:20
to think about how do you get the goods
25:23
and maybe services that you need for
25:26
your life look around your room
25:28
what things were were made in your home
25:30
country
25:31
maybe there are many things in your room
25:33
that were uh
25:34
imported from other countries and maybe
25:37
you
25:38
of course you can go down the store and
25:39
buy them or your mom or your dad can
25:42
order them online and they come to your
25:44
house but the whole world
25:46
is specializing in different things and
25:49
people everywhere have certain abilities
25:51
and certain talents so they will
25:53
specialize in making
25:54
the things that they're good at and then
25:56
they can sell them all around the world
25:58
so think about that when you grow up
26:00
maybe you will specialize
26:02
in producing some type of good or in
26:05
providing some type of service
26:07
and you can sell those things to anybody
26:09
in the world and that's all about
26:11
import and export trade okay
