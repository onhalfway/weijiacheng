hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
we're going over science book 3
lesson 11 and in lesson 11
we're describing matter matter
what's the matter no no not that kind of
matter matter is
things or everything around you that is
matter so we will discover
what are the properties of matter and we
will
also talk about how we can measure
matter okay as usual
let's begin with the vocabulary because
we need to understand some words
to talk about this subject first of all
we have the word
mass mass what is mass
mass is the amount of matter in
something
now i made a little joke at the
beginning of this lesson i said what's
the matter
but that's a different meaning it's
important also to discuss
what is matter matter is
everything right look around you right
you see the table the table is made of
wood or plastic that is matter right
look in a mirror you see your skin your
bones your flesh
that is matter too in fact there's
something all around us that we can't
see
usually we can't see it sometimes we can
see it but it's air
and that is matter too anywhere there
are
atoms that is matter okay
so matter is all around us it's
everything physical
that's around us that is what we mean by
matter
and when we talk about mass it's the
amount
of things and let's talk about atoms
maybe you already know the word atom
atom is a very small
particle or piece of something right
it's a very small you can't see it it's
so small
so you can imagine that mass is the
amount of
atoms in a certain thing right if i have
a pen
what is the mass of this pen that is
what is the
amount of atoms or material
that makes up this pen that is the mass
that is the amount of matter in
something
okay interesting idea
length length means
how long something is so i just showed
you this pen
right how long is this pen now i'm used
to inches i'm not very familiar with
centimeters
so i would say this this pen is about
one two
maybe three inches long how much is that
in centimeters i'm not sure
i i don't usually use centimeters but
it's about three inches long that's how
long it is from one end
to the other that's the length of
something
the length okay okay next we have
height now we just talked about length
that's the measurement
from one end to the other but what if i
turn the pen this way
and we're going to talk about height
right
and when we talk about height we can
also say how
tall is it and if somebody says to you
how
tall are you how tall are you they're
asking you
about your height maybe you would answer
you know 100 centimeters to 120
centimeters
i'm not sure uh but maybe you're in that
range right
how tall are you i know in inches you
know i'm more familiar with inches i
know my height is
six foot and one inch but i don't really
know that well in centimeters how tall i
am but probably you guys are maybe 100
centimeters 120 centimeters 130
centimeters
how tall are you what is the height from
the bottom of your feet
to the top of your head how tall are you
that's the measurement of something
from its bottom to its top
okay width well we're talking about a
lot of dimensions right
we talked about length we talked about
height now
imagine i'm holding the pen this way
right and the height is this way
but the width how wide is it right so
the width is
how wide something is i just asked you
how tall are you that's your height i'm
asking about your height
but i won't ask you what is your width
that's a very strange question
how wide are you and usually people
don't ask that anyway
because it could be impolite some people
are skinny
right skinny
skinny isn't really a positive word it's
a little bit of a negative word it means
somebody
needs to eat more food okay they're too
skinny
they're too thin and of course some
people can be very wide
or broad yeah okay you can say fat but
fat is a rude word don't say someone is
fat that is not polite
so usually we don't talk about that
right
but that's what it means you know if a
person is skinny they're not very wide
if a person is fat they are quite wide
usually people and then
if somebody's in the in between range we
just say they're normal
but we don't really talk about that for
people we do talk about
how wide things are for other things
like furniture we want to know can we
fit it through the door
right if your couch is too wide you
can't get it inside your house
how are you going to get inside your
house it's too wide so maybe you have to
go
in a different way so width so an object
how what is its height what is its
length and what is its width okay
so three dimensions we usually we call
these
three dimensions dimension
and there are usually three dimensions
when we talk about
the physical properties of something and
those of course are
length height and width the three
dimensions
3d ah okay good
volume now volume is another way to
measure something and it's the amount of
space
that something takes up so i here i have
a water bottle right
and you can see the water is not it's
about half full so
the volume of the water is only about
half
the width or the yeah the size of this
water bottle
so the volume is the amount of space
that something takes up
now if i was to heat up this water if i
was to make this water hotter
the volume would expand it would take up
more
of the space inside of this water bottle
so the volume is just how much space
does something take up
okay good
property a property now there's
different
mean different meanings for property you
might think property is
my house that's my property or my
backpack
is my property but we're talking about a
different idea here
a property is also we can say it's a
quality
it's like a distinction it's a unique
uh adjective or thing
about an object some type of matter
so there are many different properties
and we'll talk about those in a little
bit but just to give you an idea
a property might be how long it is we
just talked about length
a property might be how tall it is
that's another property
but a property might be what color is it
or
what shape is it those are all different
properties
of a certain object or of different
kinds of matter
next we have a balance now a balance oh
this looks like an
old machine right but we still use it
these days and there's an important
thing
that we use it for a balance is a device
a device is like a
tool or a machine that's used for
used for measuring the mass
of something so i talked about mass
before right mass
is how much matter is in something how
many atoms or
how much you know material is in
an object and we use a balance to
measure that quantity or measure that
property of a certain object now you
might think
why don't we just you know balance is
old you know if you want to
know how much it weighs why don't you
just use a scale
but there's an important difference here
a balance is used for measuring the mass
of something
not the weight right you can use it to
measure the weight
of something but mass and weight are not
the same they're not
the same thing mass is as we learned
before
how much material is in something weight
is how much something weighs in terms of
kilograms or pounds
and the idea here is that weight can
change
depending on location
what do i mean something ways different
in america than it does in korea
huh no not like that weight changes
in relation to how far away from
uh something that exerts gravity
is think about the movies like you you
may have seen movies about
uh space right astronauts out in space
and they're in the
they're in the space shuttle or they're
on the uh on the station
in uh in outer space they're they're not
walking around
they're floating around right so
somebody who weighs
uh you know 100 kilograms on earth
they don't weigh anything out in space
there's no weight but
their mass is the same aha
so you want to measure mass use a
balance
because a balance on one side
you put like a one kilogram weight oh
i'm
a horrible artist i'm sorry but maybe
this is made of metal
right and it weighs one kilogram
right and you put it on this side and
then you put the object that you want to
measure
over here and if it's the same if it's
if this bar
is perfectly flat that means
that the mass the amount of material is
the same
in the one kilogram weight as it is in
the object that you're measuring
for the place that you are right
so yes you are measuring weight but the
weight changes if you use a balance
at sea level like at a beach right
and then you use the same balance and
the same
object the same weight on top of mount
everest
there might be a slight difference
because things are
heavier at sea level
than they are at elevation in other
words
on top of a mountain so if your mom or
dad is complaining about oh i'm getting
too fat
just tell them hey let's move to
switzerland no i'm just kidding that's
crazy
the amount of difference is very small
but for scientists
it can be very important to measure the
exact amount they need to know the exact
amount of mass so they will use a
balance
to get it very precise so no matter if
they're measuring something
at the beach or they're on top of a
mountain in a laboratory somewhere
it doesn't matter where they are they
can still use a balance to find the
exact
mass and not worry about gravity
changing the weight
in terms of elevation that's a long
explanation for one word
okay anyway next mold
mold is a verb in this case
to mold something to mold something is
to
take a soft substance a soft substance
soft substance a soft material like clay
for example or maybe you have play-doh
right
in your toys do you have something like
putty or
play-doh that you can you can make
little characters out of it right that's
a soft substance
and you mold it into a shape let's say
you want to make
a head right so you you mold that play
play-doh or that putty or clay into the
shape of a head
or in this case this woman looks like
she's making a bowl
she's taking clay and she's molding the
clay
into the shape of a bowl okay those
are our words for this lesson
okay let's talk about the two main ideas
of this lesson and the first idea is
how to measure matter like i said matter
is anything that's around you right and
we want to measure it right we want to
know how much does it weigh
how much of the matter is there
or how long is it how wide is it we want
to measure these things
so as i said before and i gave kind of a
long explanation about a balance
using a balance we use a balance to
measure the mass
of a solid or a liquid
so you use a balance to measure the mass
if you want to know how something
how much something weighs then you use a
scale
a scale and there are many electronic
scales these days you probably have one
in your bathroom your family
your family member will stand on the
scale and it'll give you a little
digital readout
how many kilograms do you
weigh when you stand on the scale but
remember
weight and mass are different so if you
want to measure the mass of something
use a balance
if you just want to know how much
something weighs use a scale
okay good next we use a ruler and karine
i think you say cha
cha-cha-cha right okay sorry cha is for
measuring how long
something is right and rulers can be in
centimeters or inches
most of the world uses centimeters so
use a ruler
to measure the length the height and the
width of a solid i'll talk about solids
and things like that in a few minutes
but the length the height and the width
of a solid a solid is something
a hard that you can hold and doesn't
change shape
right now the other thing is a measuring
cup
the third thing is a measuring cup now
your mom or your dad
might use a measuring cup cooks and
chefs
that's one of their important tools
right they want to know the volume of a
liquid
so when they're cooking right they want
to know how much water to add
to the dough or how much
oil to use in a certain uh
dish so they might use a measuring cup
which shows it has a little mark on the
sides of the cup
depending on the size of the cup right
how big or how small the cup is that
line will move up and down
and they want to measure the volume what
is the volume
of a certain liquid a liquid that we
pour
into something okay so we have a balance
we have a ruler and we have a measuring
cup
three things not the only three things
there are many things but these are
three tools
three common tools that we use to
measure
matter now the properties of matter
what are the properties now i talked
about this before i made a little joke
that's my property right but we're
talking about something different here
properties of matter is we can also say
the
unique quality or the unique uh
distinctive thing about something
that gives it its uniqueness that makes
it special
it's a property of matter now some
things might have different colors
right water has a different color
than gold right they're different colors
so
that those are different properties the
shape things are shaped
differently right again water is shaped
differently from rocks right they have
different shapes
water doesn't really have a shape but it
can have a shape depending on what you
do with it
but different types of matter and matter
again is
anything that's around you they will
have different shapes
and especially if you look at them very
closely in a microscope
you'll see that the the molecules when
the atoms get together
they have different shapes okay size
how large or small is something that's
also a property
of different types of matter size flavor
what does it taste like right ice cream
has a different flavor
than this pen don't taste the pen
oh by the way you know geologists
sometimes go around
and they use their taste to figure out
what type of rock
it is so they might go around and they
lick a rock
i don't advise it don't do this because
some rocks can be poisonous they're
dangerous don't do that
usually the best way to do is to get
your finger wet
touch the rock and then lick your finger
and then you know some rocks might taste
salty they
contain salt or some rocks might taste
bitter they contain other types of
materials like borax or something like
that
and so different minerals will have
different tastes
it's interesting so you can figure out
what is what what is the matter you can
figure out
what matter it is is it is it uh
is it salt is it alkaline is it
acid it will you know what kind of
matter is it okay anyway
texture texture is another property of
matter
is it smooth or is it rough like you
haven't shaved for a while right
what is the texture smooth like a baby
this is not baby skin
but you know if you if you touch a
baby's cheek it's very smooth
if you touch my cheek after a few days
of not shaving
it's very rough okay so that's texture
smooth or rough
okay so those are different properties
of matter
okay let's do the reading section and as
we go over the reading
as always read along with me out loud
practice the pronunciation
or read along in your mind and focus on
the
key vocabulary and the ideas that we're
learning
in this lesson are you ready let's begin
everything is made from matter
matter can be a solid
a liquid or a gas
you don't have to repeat uh matter can
be a solid
liquid or gas we can describe what
something
is like by its properties
how something feels is
a property
matter can be soft hard smooth
rough etc etc
means etc etc means
and so on and so forth
okay soft hard smooth rough
and so on etc
clay is a solid you can mold
wet clay it is soft
when a clay dries out it becomes
hard
mass is another property it is
how much matter is in something
you can use a balance to measure the
mass
of a solid or a liquid
we can measure the length height
and width of a solid we use a ruler
to do this
volume is how much space something takes
up
we use a measuring cup to measure
the volume of a liquid
shape color smell and taste
are just some of the other properties
we can use to describe matter
okay very good okay let's talk about
the reading passage and how it is
organized how is the information
organized in this passage the reading
skill is
classified now remember classify is to
separate
into different groups so we might
separate things according to their
properties
but in this case we're classifying we're
separating the ideas we're separating
matter by how we can measure them what
are the tools we use
to measure things and we see over on the
left side
ruler balance and measuring cup
so we're dividing these three measuring
tools by what do they measure so first
of all the first example we have
ruler what do we measure using a ruler
you can measure three properties of a
solid
now remember before in this lesson i
talked about the 3d
the three d's right 3d what are the
three d's
right well they're a b and c now to help
you
know which one to put in which blank the
first letter of
each is given for you so under a
you see h and h refers to how
tall is something right what is the uh
measurement from the bottom to the top
and of course we're talking about
height
oops height yeah g that's a g height
my g is not very good this pen is a
little difficult height
and then the next one so that's height
how tall is something
but what if we turn it this way we want
to measure from one side to the other
uh you know from one end to the other
that is
what it starts with an l that is length
l e n g
t h length
that's length and then of course if
we're also if we're looking at something
of the height we also want to see how
you know what's the how long is it how
wide is it from one side to the other
that is
the measurement starts with the w that
is the width it's very similar to wide
right
width what is the width of something
so height length width
okay good we use a ruler to measure
those things
now we use a balance right
and we want to make sure it's like this
to get our accurate measurement if it's
like this it's not balanced right
if it's like that it's balanced so we
use a balance
to measure what of a solid or liquid
don't say weight
we're not measuring the weight although
you can use it to measure weight true
at a certain elevation but normally
we're using
a balance to measure what the mass
of a solid or liquid the mass and
remember mass
is how much material is in a thing not
how much it weighs because they can be
different
it's possible they could be different
but we're measuring the mass
and finally we have a measuring cup you
can measure
the beep of a liquid what are we
measuring when we use a measuring cup
right we pour a liquid into a measuring
cup
and we see what line it hits we're
measuring the
volume and remember the volume is the
amount of space
that something takes up volume
volume the volume of a liquid so these
are different
properties of matter
right we can measure its height we can
measure its length we can measure its
width we use a ruler we can find out how
much mass
is in this piece of matter we use a
balance
we want to know what is the volume if
it's liquid
we can measure the volume or if it's gas
you can also use gas
you can also measure the volume of a gas
by pressure but don't use a measuring
cup
to measure the volume of a gas that's
that doesn't work
but you can measure the volume of a
liquid at a certain temperature
using a measuring cup you can measure
the volume
of a liquid okay so that's a little bit
more getting into describing matter it's
building on
unit 10 or less than 10 that we went
over before
but this lesson was about how we can
describe
matter and of course matter is all the
things around us
okay well interesting lesson i hope you
learned a lot thanks for studying with
me
we'll see you in the next one take care
everybody bye bye
you

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading
00:11
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
00:14
we're going over science book 3
00:16
lesson 11 and in lesson 11
00:19
we're describing matter matter
00:23
what's the matter no no not that kind of
00:25
matter matter is
00:26
things or everything around you that is
00:29
matter so we will discover
00:31
what are the properties of matter and we
00:34
will
00:34
also talk about how we can measure
00:38
matter okay as usual
00:41
let's begin with the vocabulary because
00:44
we need to understand some words
00:46
to talk about this subject first of all
00:48
we have the word
00:50
mass mass what is mass
00:53
mass is the amount of matter in
00:56
something
00:57
now i made a little joke at the
00:58
beginning of this lesson i said what's
01:00
the matter
01:01
but that's a different meaning it's
01:02
important also to discuss
01:04
what is matter matter is
01:08
everything right look around you right
01:11
you see the table the table is made of
01:14
wood or plastic that is matter right
01:17
look in a mirror you see your skin your
01:20
bones your flesh
01:21
that is matter too in fact there's
01:24
something all around us that we can't
01:25
see
01:26
usually we can't see it sometimes we can
01:28
see it but it's air
01:30
and that is matter too anywhere there
01:32
are
01:33
atoms that is matter okay
01:36
so matter is all around us it's
01:38
everything physical
01:40
that's around us that is what we mean by
01:42
matter
01:43
and when we talk about mass it's the
01:45
amount
01:46
of things and let's talk about atoms
01:49
maybe you already know the word atom
01:53
atom is a very small
01:56
particle or piece of something right
01:58
it's a very small you can't see it it's
02:00
so small
02:01
so you can imagine that mass is the
02:03
amount of
02:04
atoms in a certain thing right if i have
02:08
a pen
02:08
what is the mass of this pen that is
02:11
what is the
02:12
amount of atoms or material
02:16
that makes up this pen that is the mass
02:19
that is the amount of matter in
02:22
something
02:22
okay interesting idea
02:26
length length means
02:29
how long something is so i just showed
02:32
you this pen
02:33
right how long is this pen now i'm used
02:36
to inches i'm not very familiar with
02:38
centimeters
02:39
so i would say this this pen is about
02:41
one two
02:42
maybe three inches long how much is that
02:45
in centimeters i'm not sure
02:46
i i don't usually use centimeters but
02:50
it's about three inches long that's how
02:51
long it is from one end
02:53
to the other that's the length of
02:55
something
02:56
the length okay okay next we have
03:00
height now we just talked about length
03:03
that's the measurement
03:04
from one end to the other but what if i
03:06
turn the pen this way
03:07
and we're going to talk about height
03:10
right
03:10
and when we talk about height we can
03:12
also say how
03:13
tall is it and if somebody says to you
03:16
how
03:17
tall are you how tall are you they're
03:20
asking you
03:21
about your height maybe you would answer
03:23
you know 100 centimeters to 120
03:25
centimeters
03:26
i'm not sure uh but maybe you're in that
03:28
range right
03:30
how tall are you i know in inches you
03:32
know i'm more familiar with inches i
03:34
know my height is
03:35
six foot and one inch but i don't really
03:38
know that well in centimeters how tall i
03:40
am but probably you guys are maybe 100
03:42
centimeters 120 centimeters 130
03:44
centimeters
03:45
how tall are you what is the height from
03:48
the bottom of your feet
03:49
to the top of your head how tall are you
03:52
that's the measurement of something
03:54
from its bottom to its top
03:57
okay width well we're talking about a
04:01
lot of dimensions right
04:02
we talked about length we talked about
04:04
height now
04:05
imagine i'm holding the pen this way
04:07
right and the height is this way
04:09
but the width how wide is it right so
04:12
the width is
04:13
how wide something is i just asked you
04:16
how tall are you that's your height i'm
04:19
asking about your height
04:21
but i won't ask you what is your width
04:23
that's a very strange question
04:25
how wide are you and usually people
04:27
don't ask that anyway
04:29
because it could be impolite some people
04:31
are skinny
04:33
right skinny
04:36
skinny isn't really a positive word it's
04:39
a little bit of a negative word it means
04:40
somebody
04:41
needs to eat more food okay they're too
04:44
skinny
04:44
they're too thin and of course some
04:47
people can be very wide
04:49
or broad yeah okay you can say fat but
04:53
fat is a rude word don't say someone is
04:56
fat that is not polite
04:58
so usually we don't talk about that
05:01
right
05:01
but that's what it means you know if a
05:02
person is skinny they're not very wide
05:05
if a person is fat they are quite wide
05:08
usually people and then
05:09
if somebody's in the in between range we
05:12
just say they're normal
05:13
but we don't really talk about that for
05:15
people we do talk about
05:17
how wide things are for other things
05:19
like furniture we want to know can we
05:21
fit it through the door
05:22
right if your couch is too wide you
05:24
can't get it inside your house
05:26
how are you going to get inside your
05:27
house it's too wide so maybe you have to
05:30
go
05:31
in a different way so width so an object
05:35
how what is its height what is its
05:38
length and what is its width okay
05:41
so three dimensions we usually we call
05:43
these
05:44
three dimensions dimension
05:50
and there are usually three dimensions
05:52
when we talk about
05:53
the physical properties of something and
05:56
those of course are
05:57
length height and width the three
06:00
dimensions
06:01
3d ah okay good
06:05
volume now volume is another way to
06:08
measure something and it's the amount of
06:10
space
06:11
that something takes up so i here i have
06:14
a water bottle right
06:15
and you can see the water is not it's
06:18
about half full so
06:20
the volume of the water is only about
06:23
half
06:23
the width or the yeah the size of this
06:26
water bottle
06:27
so the volume is the amount of space
06:29
that something takes up
06:31
now if i was to heat up this water if i
06:33
was to make this water hotter
06:35
the volume would expand it would take up
06:37
more
06:38
of the space inside of this water bottle
06:41
so the volume is just how much space
06:44
does something take up
06:46
okay good
06:49
property a property now there's
06:52
different
06:53
mean different meanings for property you
06:55
might think property is
06:57
my house that's my property or my
06:59
backpack
07:00
is my property but we're talking about a
07:02
different idea here
07:03
a property is also we can say it's a
07:06
quality
07:07
it's like a distinction it's a unique
07:11
uh adjective or thing
07:14
about an object some type of matter
07:17
so there are many different properties
07:19
and we'll talk about those in a little
07:21
bit but just to give you an idea
07:22
a property might be how long it is we
07:25
just talked about length
07:26
a property might be how tall it is
07:28
that's another property
07:30
but a property might be what color is it
07:33
or
07:34
what shape is it those are all different
07:37
properties
07:38
of a certain object or of different
07:41
kinds of matter
07:45
next we have a balance now a balance oh
07:48
this looks like an
07:49
old machine right but we still use it
07:52
these days and there's an important
07:53
thing
07:54
that we use it for a balance is a device
07:56
a device is like a
07:58
tool or a machine that's used for
08:01
used for measuring the mass
08:04
of something so i talked about mass
08:06
before right mass
08:07
is how much matter is in something how
08:10
many atoms or
08:12
how much you know material is in
08:15
an object and we use a balance to
08:18
measure that quantity or measure that
08:22
property of a certain object now you
08:26
might think
08:26
why don't we just you know balance is
08:28
old you know if you want to
08:30
know how much it weighs why don't you
08:33
just use a scale
08:35
but there's an important difference here
08:39
a balance is used for measuring the mass
08:42
of something
08:42
not the weight right you can use it to
08:45
measure the weight
08:46
of something but mass and weight are not
08:50
the same they're not
08:51
the same thing mass is as we learned
08:54
before
08:54
how much material is in something weight
08:58
is how much something weighs in terms of
09:01
kilograms or pounds
09:03
and the idea here is that weight can
09:06
change
09:07
depending on location
09:10
what do i mean something ways different
09:13
in america than it does in korea
09:15
huh no not like that weight changes
09:19
in relation to how far away from
09:23
uh something that exerts gravity
09:26
is think about the movies like you you
09:28
may have seen movies about
09:30
uh space right astronauts out in space
09:33
and they're in the
09:34
they're in the space shuttle or they're
09:35
on the uh on the station
09:37
in uh in outer space they're they're not
09:40
walking around
09:41
they're floating around right so
09:44
somebody who weighs
09:46
uh you know 100 kilograms on earth
09:49
they don't weigh anything out in space
09:51
there's no weight but
09:52
their mass is the same aha
09:56
so you want to measure mass use a
09:58
balance
09:59
because a balance on one side
10:03
you put like a one kilogram weight oh
10:06
i'm
10:07
a horrible artist i'm sorry but maybe
10:09
this is made of metal
10:10
right and it weighs one kilogram
10:14
right and you put it on this side and
10:16
then you put the object that you want to
10:18
measure
10:18
over here and if it's the same if it's
10:21
if this bar
10:22
is perfectly flat that means
10:25
that the mass the amount of material is
10:29
the same
10:30
in the one kilogram weight as it is in
10:32
the object that you're measuring
10:34
for the place that you are right
10:38
so yes you are measuring weight but the
10:40
weight changes if you use a balance
10:42
at sea level like at a beach right
10:46
and then you use the same balance and
10:48
the same
10:49
object the same weight on top of mount
10:52
everest
10:53
there might be a slight difference
10:55
because things are
10:56
heavier at sea level
11:00
than they are at elevation in other
11:02
words
11:03
on top of a mountain so if your mom or
11:06
dad is complaining about oh i'm getting
11:07
too fat
11:08
just tell them hey let's move to
11:09
switzerland no i'm just kidding that's
11:11
crazy
11:13
the amount of difference is very small
11:14
but for scientists
11:16
it can be very important to measure the
11:18
exact amount they need to know the exact
11:21
amount of mass so they will use a
11:23
balance
11:24
to get it very precise so no matter if
11:26
they're measuring something
11:28
at the beach or they're on top of a
11:30
mountain in a laboratory somewhere
11:32
it doesn't matter where they are they
11:33
can still use a balance to find the
11:35
exact
11:36
mass and not worry about gravity
11:38
changing the weight
11:41
in terms of elevation that's a long
11:44
explanation for one word
11:45
okay anyway next mold
11:49
mold is a verb in this case
11:52
to mold something to mold something is
11:55
to
11:56
take a soft substance a soft substance
11:59
soft substance a soft material like clay
12:03
for example or maybe you have play-doh
12:06
right
12:06
in your toys do you have something like
12:09
putty or
12:10
play-doh that you can you can make
12:12
little characters out of it right that's
12:14
a soft substance
12:15
and you mold it into a shape let's say
12:18
you want to make
12:18
a head right so you you mold that play
12:23
play-doh or that putty or clay into the
12:26
shape of a head
12:27
or in this case this woman looks like
12:29
she's making a bowl
12:31
she's taking clay and she's molding the
12:34
clay
12:34
into the shape of a bowl okay those
12:38
are our words for this lesson
12:41
okay let's talk about the two main ideas
12:43
of this lesson and the first idea is
12:45
how to measure matter like i said matter
12:48
is anything that's around you right and
12:50
we want to measure it right we want to
12:52
know how much does it weigh
12:54
how much of the matter is there
12:57
or how long is it how wide is it we want
12:59
to measure these things
13:01
so as i said before and i gave kind of a
13:03
long explanation about a balance
13:05
using a balance we use a balance to
13:08
measure the mass
13:09
of a solid or a liquid
13:13
so you use a balance to measure the mass
13:15
if you want to know how something
13:16
how much something weighs then you use a
13:19
scale
13:20
a scale and there are many electronic
13:23
scales these days you probably have one
13:26
in your bathroom your family
13:29
your family member will stand on the
13:30
scale and it'll give you a little
13:32
digital readout
13:33
how many kilograms do you
13:36
weigh when you stand on the scale but
13:39
remember
13:40
weight and mass are different so if you
13:42
want to measure the mass of something
13:44
use a balance
13:45
if you just want to know how much
13:46
something weighs use a scale
13:48
okay good next we use a ruler and karine
13:51
i think you say cha
13:53
cha-cha-cha right okay sorry cha is for
13:56
measuring how long
13:57
something is right and rulers can be in
13:59
centimeters or inches
14:01
most of the world uses centimeters so
14:04
use a ruler
14:05
to measure the length the height and the
14:08
width of a solid i'll talk about solids
14:12
and things like that in a few minutes
14:14
but the length the height and the width
14:16
of a solid a solid is something
14:18
a hard that you can hold and doesn't
14:20
change shape
14:21
right now the other thing is a measuring
14:25
cup
14:25
the third thing is a measuring cup now
14:27
your mom or your dad
14:29
might use a measuring cup cooks and
14:31
chefs
14:33
that's one of their important tools
14:34
right they want to know the volume of a
14:37
liquid
14:37
so when they're cooking right they want
14:39
to know how much water to add
14:41
to the dough or how much
14:46
oil to use in a certain uh
14:49
dish so they might use a measuring cup
14:52
which shows it has a little mark on the
14:54
sides of the cup
14:55
depending on the size of the cup right
14:57
how big or how small the cup is that
14:59
line will move up and down
15:01
and they want to measure the volume what
15:03
is the volume
15:04
of a certain liquid a liquid that we
15:07
pour
15:07
into something okay so we have a balance
15:10
we have a ruler and we have a measuring
15:12
cup
15:13
three things not the only three things
15:15
there are many things but these are
15:17
three tools
15:18
three common tools that we use to
15:20
measure
15:21
matter now the properties of matter
15:26
what are the properties now i talked
15:27
about this before i made a little joke
15:29
that's my property right but we're
15:30
talking about something different here
15:33
properties of matter is we can also say
15:35
the
15:36
unique quality or the unique uh
15:40
distinctive thing about something
15:43
that gives it its uniqueness that makes
15:46
it special
15:47
it's a property of matter now some
15:49
things might have different colors
15:52
right water has a different color
15:55
than gold right they're different colors
15:58
so
15:58
that those are different properties the
16:00
shape things are shaped
16:02
differently right again water is shaped
16:05
differently from rocks right they have
16:07
different shapes
16:08
water doesn't really have a shape but it
16:09
can have a shape depending on what you
16:11
do with it
16:12
but different types of matter and matter
16:16
again is
16:16
anything that's around you they will
16:18
have different shapes
16:20
and especially if you look at them very
16:22
closely in a microscope
16:24
you'll see that the the molecules when
16:26
the atoms get together
16:27
they have different shapes okay size
16:31
how large or small is something that's
16:33
also a property
16:35
of different types of matter size flavor
16:39
what does it taste like right ice cream
16:41
has a different flavor
16:43
than this pen don't taste the pen
16:46
oh by the way you know geologists
16:48
sometimes go around
16:50
and they use their taste to figure out
16:52
what type of rock
16:54
it is so they might go around and they
16:56
lick a rock
16:57
i don't advise it don't do this because
16:59
some rocks can be poisonous they're
17:00
dangerous don't do that
17:02
usually the best way to do is to get
17:04
your finger wet
17:05
touch the rock and then lick your finger
17:08
and then you know some rocks might taste
17:09
salty they
17:10
contain salt or some rocks might taste
17:13
bitter they contain other types of
17:16
materials like borax or something like
17:17
that
17:18
and so different minerals will have
17:20
different tastes
17:22
it's interesting so you can figure out
17:23
what is what what is the matter you can
17:26
figure out
17:27
what matter it is is it is it uh
17:30
is it salt is it alkaline is it
17:33
acid it will you know what kind of
17:35
matter is it okay anyway
17:36
texture texture is another property of
17:39
matter
17:40
is it smooth or is it rough like you
17:42
haven't shaved for a while right
17:44
what is the texture smooth like a baby
17:46
this is not baby skin
17:47
but you know if you if you touch a
17:49
baby's cheek it's very smooth
17:51
if you touch my cheek after a few days
17:53
of not shaving
17:54
it's very rough okay so that's texture
17:57
smooth or rough
17:58
okay so those are different properties
18:01
of matter
18:02
okay let's do the reading section and as
18:04
we go over the reading
18:05
as always read along with me out loud
18:08
practice the pronunciation
18:09
or read along in your mind and focus on
18:12
the
18:12
key vocabulary and the ideas that we're
18:15
learning
18:16
in this lesson are you ready let's begin
18:20
everything is made from matter
18:24
matter can be a solid
18:28
a liquid or a gas
18:31
you don't have to repeat uh matter can
18:34
be a solid
18:35
liquid or gas we can describe what
18:39
something
18:39
is like by its properties
18:44
how something feels is
18:47
a property
18:50
matter can be soft hard smooth
18:54
rough etc etc
18:57
means etc etc means
19:01
and so on and so forth
19:04
okay soft hard smooth rough
19:08
and so on etc
19:12
clay is a solid you can mold
19:16
wet clay it is soft
19:19
when a clay dries out it becomes
19:22
hard
19:25
mass is another property it is
19:29
how much matter is in something
19:32
you can use a balance to measure the
19:35
mass
19:35
of a solid or a liquid
19:40
we can measure the length height
19:43
and width of a solid we use a ruler
19:48
to do this
19:51
volume is how much space something takes
19:55
up
19:56
we use a measuring cup to measure
19:59
the volume of a liquid
20:03
shape color smell and taste
20:07
are just some of the other properties
20:10
we can use to describe matter
20:14
okay very good okay let's talk about
20:18
the reading passage and how it is
20:20
organized how is the information
20:22
organized in this passage the reading
20:24
skill is
20:25
classified now remember classify is to
20:27
separate
20:28
into different groups so we might
20:30
separate things according to their
20:32
properties
20:33
but in this case we're classifying we're
20:35
separating the ideas we're separating
20:38
matter by how we can measure them what
20:40
are the tools we use
20:42
to measure things and we see over on the
20:44
left side
20:45
ruler balance and measuring cup
20:48
so we're dividing these three measuring
20:53
tools by what do they measure so first
20:56
of all the first example we have
20:57
ruler what do we measure using a ruler
21:01
you can measure three properties of a
21:03
solid
21:04
now remember before in this lesson i
21:06
talked about the 3d
21:08
the three d's right 3d what are the
21:10
three d's
21:12
right well they're a b and c now to help
21:15
you
21:16
know which one to put in which blank the
21:18
first letter of
21:19
each is given for you so under a
21:22
you see h and h refers to how
21:26
tall is something right what is the uh
21:30
measurement from the bottom to the top
21:32
and of course we're talking about
21:34
height
21:38
oops height yeah g that's a g height
21:42
my g is not very good this pen is a
21:43
little difficult height
21:45
and then the next one so that's height
21:47
how tall is something
21:48
but what if we turn it this way we want
21:50
to measure from one side to the other
21:52
uh you know from one end to the other
21:54
that is
21:55
what it starts with an l that is length
21:59
l e n g
22:02
t h length
22:06
that's length and then of course if
22:08
we're also if we're looking at something
22:10
of the height we also want to see how
22:12
you know what's the how long is it how
22:16
wide is it from one side to the other
22:18
that is
22:19
the measurement starts with the w that
22:21
is the width it's very similar to wide
22:23
right
22:24
width what is the width of something
22:27
so height length width
22:31
okay good we use a ruler to measure
22:33
those things
22:35
now we use a balance right
22:38
and we want to make sure it's like this
22:40
to get our accurate measurement if it's
22:41
like this it's not balanced right
22:43
if it's like that it's balanced so we
22:45
use a balance
22:47
to measure what of a solid or liquid
22:49
don't say weight
22:51
we're not measuring the weight although
22:52
you can use it to measure weight true
22:54
at a certain elevation but normally
22:57
we're using
22:58
a balance to measure what the mass
23:01
of a solid or liquid the mass and
23:04
remember mass
23:05
is how much material is in a thing not
23:08
how much it weighs because they can be
23:10
different
23:10
it's possible they could be different
23:12
but we're measuring the mass
23:15
and finally we have a measuring cup you
23:17
can measure
23:18
the beep of a liquid what are we
23:21
measuring when we use a measuring cup
23:23
right we pour a liquid into a measuring
23:25
cup
23:25
and we see what line it hits we're
23:28
measuring the
23:29
volume and remember the volume is the
23:31
amount of space
23:33
that something takes up volume
23:36
volume the volume of a liquid so these
23:39
are different
23:41
properties of matter
23:44
right we can measure its height we can
23:46
measure its length we can measure its
23:48
width we use a ruler we can find out how
23:51
much mass
23:52
is in this piece of matter we use a
23:55
balance
23:55
we want to know what is the volume if
23:57
it's liquid
23:59
we can measure the volume or if it's gas
24:01
you can also use gas
24:02
you can also measure the volume of a gas
24:05
by pressure but don't use a measuring
24:07
