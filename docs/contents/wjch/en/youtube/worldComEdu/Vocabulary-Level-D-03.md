hello everybody and welcome back to
reading for
vocabulary i'm brian stewart well we're
on our last
lesson for unit one talking about
architecture
in lesson three we're going to be
talking about a
famous architect right we've talked
about
the architect as a job we've talked
about examples of famous architecture
around the world now let's talk about a
famous
person who is an architect and his name
is
frank lloyd wright we can see many of
his buildings still around today
we're going to focus on let's learning
about frank lloyd wright
well who was frank lloyd wright what did
he look like there he is
he he looks very thoughtful of course
this is an
old picture frank lloyd wright lived a
while ago
he's not living anymore and he designed
many
uh famous buildings in america um
he kind of looks like einstein right
very thoughtful with the white hair
but anyway this is him he's very he was
a very famous architect
now what are some of the buildings that
he left behind
this is an example of a house this house
was designed
by frank lloyd wright in fact he
designed and he had built
many different houses and if you're
lucky and if you are an owner of this
house
you can be very proud and of course the
house is is quite expensive though
but they're very well designed and
they're very easy to live in they're
very uh
good design they look and feel very nice
also frank lloyd wright didn't just
design houses
he designed a lots of different types of
buildings also he designed different
types of
structures that are like monuments or
statues and this is this is an example
of one of the monuments or statues that
frank lloyd wright
created so architects don't just create
one type of building like a house or
an office building they do many
different things
architects can be very creative and
build all sorts of different structures
and we'll read about that later but
before we get to the reading
we should go over the vocabulary the
first word we're going to study here
is the word to describe something that
doesn't go
straight now if a road goes straight we
say okay it's straight it doesn't
have any what it doesn't have any
curves okay if you see a road
that goes to the right or it goes to the
left
we say it has a curve we can say there
is a curve in the road be careful
slow down if you're riding your bike
it's you can go fast if it's straight
but slow down on a curve okay
next word now looks like this is the
she lives here right she's answering the
door and she is coming by
why she is someone who goes to a place
for a short time
who what do we call this person we call
this person
a visitor she is visiting
her she is visiting her right
so she is a visitor to her home
okay if you come to my house you are a
visitor to my house
if i go to your house i am a visitor to
your house
a visitor the next one to change how
someone
thinks or acts so if you want to change
the way someone behaves
maybe you don't like their behavior or
maybe you want to
improve their behavior like for example
in a sports game
you need to influence you need to
influence them
so the fact that mom and dad are they
like to play tennis they like to
play sports that will influence their
daughter she will grow up and she will
like to play sports too
because they're changing how how someone
else
thinks or acts you influence them who
has influenced you in your life
next one the area around
something okay so if we say that like
there's many buildings in a city
what do we call the area around the
buildings we call it
the environment it's also the area
around us right we can have different
environments
if we are in the city we say we are in
an urban urban
environment urban means city we are in
the city
that's the type of environment we are in
but if we go to the country
then we say we are in a r
i'm sorry i was thinking about the
pronunciation a
rural be careful because pronunciation
is
right r l rural rural means
you're in the country so you can have an
urban environment that's
in the city or you can have a rural
environment
there's just one l that's out in the
countryside so
different environments it's the area
what is your environment
like next one wow very pretty
looks like somewhere in europe maybe
switzerland it's very pretty
if we talk about the land being very
pretty we can say it's beautiful
also another specific word for the land
we say it's
scenic scenic so
beautiful very pretty it's beautiful if
we're talking about the land
the landscape we say it's scenic in
switzerland
it's very scenic countryside it's very
beautiful
countryside next one to have
information about if you have
information about something
you know it so what information do you
have inside your head
that's the same as asking what do you
know
now no is an irregular verb so we use it
when we're talking in the past quago
right
we say no chigum
nu chane and non
maybe for a long time i have known that
for a long time
so to know no new known
ah did you know i was from america
yeah i've known that for months okay
i knew that before okay and what do you
know now no new known okay next one
useful items in our home that we can
move
around so there are many useful items
you can sit on them
you can put things inside them there are
containers
you can put things on top of them so
we're talking about
chairs sofas tables cabinets
useful items in our home that but we can
move them around
they're not fixed right this is a
fireplace we're not talking about that
you can't move the fireplace right it
stays there
but the things you can move around we
call
furniture furniture
be careful when we say furniture we mean
everything furniture is non-count
don't no no s
at the end of furniture never say
furnitures
it's furniture there's a lot of
furniture in this room
or there's only one piece of furniture
in this room okay there's a little
furniture or there's
a lot of furniture but don't use s it's
non-count
okay to finish doing something
important you finish doing something
important right
so you have achieved something to
achieve
what have you achieved in your life
right you've graduated from different
grades in
elementary school maybe you're going on
to middle school or starting high school
you've achieved uh you've successfully
achieved graduating
from these different grades you maybe
got an a on a test
hopefully more than one test you've
achieved you've made
many achievements okay so you have
achieved something
now achieve meant as one word that's the
noun
but achieve just achieve that's the verb
what did you
achieve i have many achievements
okay next one natural like plants and
animals when we go to the store and we
buy something
we want to look for maybe organic
foods organic means they were made
naturally
think about that we think well plants
are natural what are you talking about
the thing is the idea there is that for
a long time
many plants are grown using chemicals
or man-made products but sometimes this
might be unhealthy
those chemicals might not be good for
our bodies
so now people are more concerned or are
interested
in foods that are grown completely
naturally with no chemicals
no man-made chemicals and we call that
type of food organic nothing
unnatural was used to make these plants
no unnatural chemicals for example
okay next one different from everything
else
so and this is a good example because
this is what we call
a finger print
and if you think about it
i have a print on my finger right you
have a print
on your finger but if we put them here
side by side
they will be different why because
everybody
has a unique unique means
one of a kind you're the only person
with that fingerprint in the world isn't
that interesting
right of course police
use fingerprints to find criminals right
so maybe it's not great but of course
you're not a you will
you won't do anything bad but think
about that the fingerprint that you have
on your finger is different from your
sister
it's different from your brother it's
different from your mom or your dad
you are unique only you have that
certain pattern
on your fingers you are unique and not
just in fingerprints but in many other
ways too
okay the next word is this ojim maliwayo
is my pronunciation okay that's a
difficult word for me to pronounce
but if you have to go to the bathroom if
you have to go to the bathroom where we
go to the bathroom
you use this device here it's kind of
like an appliance
what do we call it we call it a toilet
so i need to use the toilet is very
common i need to use the toilet
now some people when they're in a
department store or they're in a movie
theater
and you need to use a toilet some people
might say excuse
me where is the toilet now in that case
they might be talking about the room
maybe they don't have to use the toilet
maybe they just want to wash their face
or
or change their clothes right for some
reason
in that case you can also say where is
the rest
room or where is the
bath room it's actually
it's actually more polite to say where
is the restroom
than to say where is the toilet so if
you want to be polite
it's better to say where is the restroom
you can say bathroom
but most common for public places we say
excuse me where is the restroom and then
you can tell your friend
i have to use the toilet but you know
it's more polite to say restroom anyway
so but we use the toilet
in the restroom next word okay now in
this word we have
water going from a high place to a lower
place
it's a lot of water and we're talking
about a lot of water not a little water
but a lot of water like a river
right or a large stream
going from a high place to a low place
and it's a very easy word when you think
about it because we're talking about
water
what does the water do it's falling so
we say it's a waterfall very easy word
right
water water fall waterfall
it's not a verb it's a noun a waterfall
and there are many famous
waterfalls in the world okay
done with no mistakes wow look at that a
plus
big percent choil right so done with no
mistakes
what do we call that we say he did it
perfectly
now l y means it's an adjective i'm
sorry adverb
and that defines the verb so
he did
it perfect
lee because perfectly we're describing
how did he do it right but we can also
use just the word perfect
his score
is perfect
now in this case it's an adjective
because we're talking about a noun we're
describing a noun
his score is perfect he did
it perfect lee okay so that's the
difference
using l y are we describing the verb or
are we describing
the noun how did you do on your last
test did you do it perfectly
did you have a perfect score i hope so
okay let's move on a hard cover for some
sea animals
do you like to go to the beach on the
beach when you're walking along you have
the water and the sand
and right next to where the water comes
you can find many
hard coverings these are parts of
animals
right they're not stones they're parts
of animals
animals made those what do we call them
we call them
sea shells and as you can see they can
be very beautiful
and different designs and some people
like to collect
them okay but try not to collect too
much of them in some places because
the next person who goes there there's
no seashells so sometimes it's best just
to leave things in nature
and just look at it appreciate it but
leave it there for the next person to
come
and enjoy it too okay but seashells
okay next one a long floor that goes up
unfortunately there are people who are
handicapped
they uh cannot move uh normally
so we need to help them and one way to
help them
is like this if you look at this boy you
think how can he go upstairs
if there's a building and there are only
stairs in the building
it's very terrible for him how does he
get into the building
so many buildings will build these long
floors that go up
to help handicap people who are in
wheelchairs
we call these areas ramps they're a ramp
it's a nice
gentle slope that you can go up in a
wheelchair
or for other people maybe older people
or people who are injured
and they have a hard time they can go up
the ramp more easily
than other people who just climb up the
stairs okay the next one
the act of finding new information
so this is what scientists do all the
time they're trying to find
new information so they do research
usually when we talk about research of
course scientists do a lot of research
but many other people do research too
right uh
professors at the university if their if
their subject is
literature they're researching the old
text about maybe william shakespeare
or some other famous author from a long
time ago
if you are an artist you will do
research
by researching famous painters in
history or
famous painters or new modern trends in
painting
when you find new information you are
doing
research and be careful here research is
a non-count
noun people do research we don't do
research is
we do research okay so the scientists
have a lot of inch are doing a lot of
interesting
research it's non-count don't put an
s on the end of it or yes okay
now let's review the words that we have
just learned and
with some exercises the instructions are
choose the word that best completes the
sentence
these are our words we need to find one
the best one to put into these blanks
number one you should beep
more in school somebody's always telling
you this right sorry
you don't work hard enough okay so
you should what in more in school you
should
influence more in school you should
influence your friends that doesn't make
sense
you should allow allow that doesn't make
allow what uh
you should sleep more yes that's it you
should sleep more in school
no absolutely not i'm sorry
i didn't say that shh okay you should
achieve more in school
that makes sense okay that's the right
one don't sleep more in school okay i'm
just kidding
you should achieve more in school in
other words
you if somebody doesn't work hard enough
let's say your friend
is a little lazy they don't study hard
enough they get bad grades
on their on their tests you could say
you don't achieve
enough you should achieve more in school
you don't work hard enough okay so work
harder
achieve more okay number two
now don't forget number one you should
achieve more in school okay number two
that lady is beep she should be a movie
star
when you watch the movies when you when
you look at the movies
these days normally movies aren't really
real
right the people in the movies are
always
very good looking right especially it's
interesting when you look at movies
that are based on a true story right and
you look at the actors
the actors are always usually much
better looking
than the people who the story is based
on right that's very interesting
but you know that's part of
entertainment so what what can we say
that lady
is beyond beyond means she's further
away that doesn't make sense
she is beautiful ah she's beautiful
that's probably the right answer
she she is achieved you can't say
somebody is achieve
achieve is a verb not an adjective so
that doesn't make sense
that lady is perfectly no remember
perfectly describes a verb not a noun
so that wouldn't work if you said that
lady is perfect
that could be an answer but this is
perfectly so it doesn't fit
grammatically
the best answer of course is beautiful
like i said before
that's probably your answer that lady is
beautiful
she should be a movie star because
when we look at movies usually the
beautiful people
are the movie stars that's changing
recently nowadays
there are more and more people who look
like real people in the movies and
that's maybe a good thing too
because it really should be based on
talent not beauty
okay three the road
beep up ahead be ready to turn remember
when i talked about this i said if the
road is straight
you don't have to be so careful but if
the road
it does this right you have to be ready
to
turn right so what does the road do
does the road influences does it
achieves does it curves
does it fits the road of course
curves up ahead the road curves so be
ready to turn
remember a curve can be to the right or
inchokuro or it can be to the left
wenchokuro
or jayajan right still learning my
korean
okay so it can curve either direction to
the right
or to the left be ready to turn turn
right or turn left
okay four do you
beep what the homework is for tonight
so if your teacher gave you some
homework
right and you were sleeping you don't
what
oh sorry that's cursed you don't know
what the homework is so you ask your
friend do you
know what the homework is for tonight do
you know what the homework is for
tonight
you wouldn't say do you chance that's
not right do you believe
that doesn't fit and do you research no
do you know
if you have the information in your head
you have the answer
in your head then you know it if you
don't have the answer in your head
you're going to try to find it then you
will research it but we don't say do you
research we say do you know because we
want to know
do you know the information or don't you
know the information
do you know what the homework is for
tonight
and we can use many words here do you
know
how do you know where do you know
when do you know why do you know
who okay so we can use lots of these
question
words here after do you know and we want
to know if you know that information or
not do you know
how to get to school do you know where i
live
do you know when the test is
do you know why we're having a test do
you know
who our teacher is right if you know
this information
you can use these question words after
do you know to find
out that information from your friends
okay let's continue
no do you know what the homework is for
tonight okay next one number five
many people go to the new museum every
year
so when you go to a museum you go there
for a short time you don't live there
you don't stay there
you go there for a short time and then
you leave
so what types of what can we describe
that situation many environments
environments don't go to museums right
visitors ah visitors go for a short time
that's our answer
many visitors go to the new museum every
year
not faster not sea seashells go to the
museum
maybe there might be an exhibit on them
about seashells but they don't go there
every year that's kind of silly
okay let's move on to number six
where i live the beep is cold and snowy
so we're talking about the
area around you it can also be just
around you
or around your house it's the area in
which you live is
cold and snowy that's the space that
surrounds you
what word is that the furniture is cold
and snowy
furniture can't be snowy furniture can
be cold but not snowy
the the visitor is cold and snowy that
doesn't make sense
the environment ah the environment the
space around you
like the country around you is cold and
snowy maybe you live
far in the north the environment is cold
and snowy
not the influence so where i live the
environment is cold
and snowy okay let's move on to number
seven
all the beep in our house is made of
wood
so what do you have inside your house
that might be made
of wood and it's typically usually
made of wood think about your bed think
about your chair
think about your table your desk right
these things what do we call these
things we call them inside
no do we call them visitors no people
are not made of wood
okay do we call them furniture yes we
call them furniture
all the furniture in our house is made
of wood
not all the beautiful beautiful is an
adjective not a noun
that doesn't fit so the best one is
furniture
all the furniture in our house is made
of wood and that's typical usually
furniture is made of wood
number eight my teacher beep me in a
good way
i work harder now so if your teacher
has done something to change your
behavior
so that you work harder now what did
your teacher do did your teacher visitor
you that doesn't make sense
grammatically
did your teacher achieves you again
that doesn't make sense grammatically
your teacher
knows you in a good way that's a little
strange
your teacher influences ah your teacher
influences me in a good way it
changed my behavior in a good way
okay so that's the answer there my
teacher influences me in a good way
now i work harder so people who inspire
you
people who you want to follow or copy
they may influence you
to change your behavior or the way that
you think okay well that wraps it up for
the vocabulary section let's take a
short break

01:19
was designed
01:20
by frank lloyd wright in fact he

01:24
many different houses and if you're
01:26
lucky and if you are an owner of this
01:28
house
01:28
you can be very proud and of course the

01:35
they're very easy to live in they're
01:37

01:40
good design they look and feel very nice
01:44

he designed a lots of different types of
01:49
buildings also he designed different
01:52
types of
01:53
structures that are like monuments or
01:56
statues and this is this is an example
02:00
of one of the monuments or statues that
02:03
frank lloyd wright
02:05
created so architects don't just create
02:08
one type of building like a house or
02:12
an office building they do many
02:14
different things
02:15
architects can be very creative and
02:17
build all sorts of different structures
02:20
and we'll read about that later but
02:22
before we get to the reading
02:23
we should go over the vocabulary the
02:26
first word we're going to study here
02:28
is the word to describe something that
02:30
doesn't go
02:31
straight now if a road goes straight we
02:34
say okay it's straight it doesn't
02:36
have any what it doesn't have any
02:39
curves okay if you see a road
02:42
that goes to the right or it goes to the
02:45
left
02:46
we say it has a curve we can say there
02:49
is a curve in the road be careful
02:53
slow down if you're riding your bike
02:55
it's you can go fast if it's straight
02:57
but slow down on a curve okay
03:00
next word now looks like this is the
03:03
she lives here right she's answering the
03:05
door and she is coming by
03:07
why she is someone who goes to a place
03:10
for a short time
03:11
who what do we call this person we call
03:14
this person
03:15
a visitor she is visiting
03:18
her she is visiting her right
03:21
so she is a visitor to her home
03:25
okay if you come to my house you are a
03:27
visitor to my house
03:29
if i go to your house i am a visitor to
03:32
your house
03:33
a visitor the next one to change how
03:36
someone
03:37
thinks or acts so if you want to change
03:40
the way someone behaves
03:42
maybe you don't like their behavior or
03:44
maybe you want to
03:46
improve their behavior like for example
03:47
in a sports game
03:49
you need to influence you need to
03:52
influence them
03:53
so the fact that mom and dad are they
03:55
like to play tennis they like to
03:57
play sports that will influence their
04:00
daughter she will grow up and she will
04:02
like to play sports too
04:04
because they're changing how how someone
04:07
else
04:07
thinks or acts you influence them who
04:11
has influenced you in your life
04:14
next one the area around
04:17
something okay so if we say that like
04:20
there's many buildings in a city
04:22
what do we call the area around the
04:24
buildings we call it
04:25
the environment it's also the area
04:29
around us right we can have different
04:32
environments
04:33
if we are in the city we say we are in
04:36
an urban urban
04:39
environment urban means city we are in
04:42
the city
04:42
that's the type of environment we are in
04:45
but if we go to the country
04:47
then we say we are in a r
04:50
i'm sorry i was thinking about the
04:52
pronunciation a
04:53
rural be careful because pronunciation
04:56
is
04:58
right r l rural rural means
05:02
you're in the country so you can have an
05:04
urban environment that's
05:06
in the city or you can have a rural
05:09
environment
05:10
there's just one l that's out in the
05:12
countryside so
05:14

05:17
like next one wow very pretty
05:21

05:22
switzerland it's very pretty
05:24

05:26
pretty we can say it's beautiful
05:29
also another specific word for the land
05:32
we say it's
05:33
scenic scenic so
05:36
beautiful very pretty it's beautiful if
05:38
we're talking about the land
05:40
the landscape we say it's scenic in
05:43
switzerland
05:44
it's very scenic countryside it's very
05:46
beautiful
05:47
countryside next one to have
05:50
information about if you have
05:52
information about something
05:54
you know it so what information do you
05:57
have inside your head
05:59
that's the same as asking what do you
06:01
know
06:02
now no is an irregular verb so we use it
06:06
when we're talking in the past quago
06:08
right
06:08
we say no chigum
06:11
nu chane and non
06:14
maybe for a long time i have known that
06:17
for a long time
06:18
so to know no new known
06:22
ah did you know i was from america
06:25
yeah i've known that for months okay
06:29
i knew that before okay and what do you
06:32
know now no new known okay next one
06:37
useful items in our home that we can
06:40
move
06:40
around so there are many useful items
06:43
you can sit on them
06:44
you can put things inside them there are
06:47
containers
06:48
you can put things on top of them so
06:50
we're talking about
06:51
chairs sofas tables cabinets
06:54
useful items in our home that but we can
06:57
move them around
06:57
they're not fixed right this is a
06:59
fireplace we're not talking about that
07:01
you can't move the fireplace right it
07:03
stays there
07:04
but the things you can move around we
07:06
call
07:07
furniture furniture
07:11
be careful when we say furniture we mean
07:15
everything furniture is non-count
07:19
don't no no s
07:22
at the end of furniture never say
07:25
furnitures
07:27
it's furniture there's a lot of
07:29
furniture in this room
07:31
or there's only one piece of furniture
07:35
in this room okay there's a little
07:37
furniture or there's
07:39
a lot of furniture but don't use s it's
07:41
non-count
07:42
okay to finish doing something
07:45
important you finish doing something
07:48
important right
07:49
so you have achieved something to
07:52
achieve
07:53
what have you achieved in your life
07:55
right you've graduated from different
07:57
grades in
07:58
elementary school maybe you're going on
08:00
to middle school or starting high school
08:03
you've achieved uh you've successfully
08:06
achieved graduating
08:07
from these different grades you maybe
08:09
got an a on a test
08:11
hopefully more than one test you've
08:13
achieved you've made
08:14
many achievements okay so you have
08:17
achieved something
08:18
now achieve meant as one word that's the
08:21
noun
08:22
but achieve just achieve that's the verb
08:25
what did you
08:26
achieve i have many achievements
08:29
okay next one natural like plants and
08:33
animals when we go to the store and we
08:35
buy something
08:36
we want to look for maybe organic
08:39
foods organic means they were made
08:42
naturally
08:43
think about that we think well plants
08:44
are natural what are you talking about
08:47
the thing is the idea there is that for
08:50
a long time
08:51
many plants are grown using chemicals
08:55
or man-made products but sometimes this
08:57
might be unhealthy
08:58
those chemicals might not be good for
09:01
our bodies
09:02
so now people are more concerned or are
09:05
interested
09:06
in foods that are grown completely
09:09
naturally with no chemicals
09:12
no man-made chemicals and we call that
09:15
type of food organic nothing
09:19
unnatural was used to make these plants
09:22
no unnatural chemicals for example
09:25
okay next one different from everything
09:28
else
09:29
so and this is a good example because
09:31
this is what we call
09:32
a finger print
09:35
and if you think about it
09:38
i have a print on my finger right you
09:41
have a print
09:42
on your finger but if we put them here
09:44
side by side
09:45
they will be different why because
09:47
everybody
09:48
has a unique unique means
09:51
one of a kind you're the only person
09:55
with that fingerprint in the world isn't
09:58
that interesting
09:59
right of course police
10:03
use fingerprints to find criminals right
10:06
so maybe it's not great but of course
10:08
you're not a you will
10:09
you won't do anything bad but think
10:11
about that the fingerprint that you have
10:13
on your finger is different from your
10:14
sister
10:15
it's different from your brother it's
10:16
different from your mom or your dad
10:18
you are unique only you have that
10:21
certain pattern
10:22
on your fingers you are unique and not
10:24
just in fingerprints but in many other
10:26
ways too
10:28
okay the next word is this ojim maliwayo
10:31
is my pronunciation okay that's a
10:33
difficult word for me to pronounce
10:34
but if you have to go to the bathroom if
10:37
you have to go to the bathroom where we
10:38
go to the bathroom
10:39
you use this device here it's kind of
10:43
like an appliance
10:44
what do we call it we call it a toilet
10:47
so i need to use the toilet is very
10:50
common i need to use the toilet
10:52
now some people when they're in a
10:54
department store or they're in a movie
10:56
theater
10:56
and you need to use a toilet some people
10:59
might say excuse
11:00
me where is the toilet now in that case
11:02
they might be talking about the room
11:04
maybe they don't have to use the toilet
11:06
maybe they just want to wash their face
11:08
or
11:08
or change their clothes right for some
11:11
reason
11:12
in that case you can also say where is
11:14
the rest
11:17
room or where is the
11:21
bath room it's actually
11:25
it's actually more polite to say where
11:28
is the restroom
11:30
than to say where is the toilet so if
11:32
you want to be polite
11:33
it's better to say where is the restroom
11:36
you can say bathroom
11:37
but most common for public places we say
11:40
excuse me where is the restroom and then
11:43
you can tell your friend
11:44
i have to use the toilet but you know
11:47
it's more polite to say restroom anyway
11:50
so but we use the toilet
11:52
in the restroom next word okay now in
11:55
this word we have
11:56
water going from a high place to a lower
11:59
place
11:59
it's a lot of water and we're talking
12:01
about a lot of water not a little water
12:03
but a lot of water like a river
12:06
right or a large stream
12:09
going from a high place to a low place
12:12
and it's a very easy word when you think
12:14
about it because we're talking about
12:15
water
12:16
what does the water do it's falling so
12:19
we say it's a waterfall very easy word
12:22
right
12:22
water water fall waterfall
12:26
it's not a verb it's a noun a waterfall
12:28
and there are many famous
12:30
waterfalls in the world okay
12:33
done with no mistakes wow look at that a
12:36
plus
12:37
big percent choil right so done with no
12:40
mistakes
12:40
what do we call that we say he did it
12:43
perfectly
12:45
now l y means it's an adjective i'm
12:49
sorry adverb
12:50
and that defines the verb so
12:53
he did
12:57
it perfect
13:02
lee because perfectly we're describing
13:05
how did he do it right but we can also
13:08
use just the word perfect
13:11
his score
13:15
is perfect
13:19
now in this case it's an adjective
13:21
because we're talking about a noun we're
13:23
describing a noun
13:24
his score is perfect he did
13:28
it perfect lee okay so that's the
13:30
difference
13:31
using l y are we describing the verb or
13:34
are we describing
13:35
the noun how did you do on your last
13:37
test did you do it perfectly
13:39
did you have a perfect score i hope so
13:42
okay let's move on a hard cover for some
13:46
sea animals
13:47
do you like to go to the beach on the
13:49
beach when you're walking along you have
13:51
the water and the sand
13:52
and right next to where the water comes
13:54
you can find many
13:55
hard coverings these are parts of
13:58
animals
13:58
right they're not stones they're parts
14:01
of animals
14:02
animals made those what do we call them
14:05
we call them
14:05
sea shells and as you can see they can
14:08
be very beautiful
14:09
and different designs and some people
14:12
like to collect
14:13
them okay but try not to collect too
14:16
much of them in some places because
14:18
the next person who goes there there's
14:19
no seashells so sometimes it's best just
14:22
to leave things in nature
14:23
and just look at it appreciate it but
14:26
leave it there for the next person to
14:28
come
14:28
and enjoy it too okay but seashells
14:31
okay next one a long floor that goes up
14:35
unfortunately there are people who are
14:38
handicapped
14:39
they uh cannot move uh normally
14:42
so we need to help them and one way to
14:46
help them
14:47
is like this if you look at this boy you
14:49
think how can he go upstairs
14:51
if there's a building and there are only
14:53
stairs in the building
14:55
it's very terrible for him how does he
14:57
get into the building
14:59
so many buildings will build these long
15:02
floors that go up
15:03
to help handicap people who are in
15:05
wheelchairs
15:06
we call these areas ramps they're a ramp
15:10
it's a nice
15:11
gentle slope that you can go up in a
15:13
wheelchair
15:14
or for other people maybe older people
15:16
or people who are injured
15:18
and they have a hard time they can go up
15:20
the ramp more easily
15:22
than other people who just climb up the
15:24
stairs okay the next one
15:27
the act of finding new information
15:30
so this is what scientists do all the
15:32
time they're trying to find
15:34
new information so they do research
15:38
usually when we talk about research of
15:40
course scientists do a lot of research
15:43
but many other people do research too
15:45
right uh
15:46
professors at the university if their if
15:49
their subject is
15:50
literature they're researching the old
15:53
text about maybe william shakespeare
15:55
or some other famous author from a long
15:58
time ago
16:00
if you are an artist you will do
16:02
research
16:03
by researching famous painters in
16:06
history or
16:07
famous painters or new modern trends in
16:10
painting
16:11
when you find new information you are
16:14
doing
16:14
research and be careful here research is
16:17
a non-count
16:18
noun people do research we don't do
16:21
research is
16:23
we do research okay so the scientists
16:26
have a lot of inch are doing a lot of
16:29
interesting
16:30
research it's non-count don't put an
16:33
s on the end of it or yes okay
16:37
now let's review the words that we have
16:39
just learned and
16:40
with some exercises the instructions are
16:43
choose the word that best completes the
16:45
sentence
16:45
these are our words we need to find one
16:49
the best one to put into these blanks
16:52
number one you should beep
16:55
more in school somebody's always telling
16:59
you this right sorry
17:01
you don't work hard enough okay so
17:04
you should what in more in school you
17:07
should
17:07
influence more in school you should
17:09
influence your friends that doesn't make
17:10
sense
17:11
you should allow allow that doesn't make
17:13
allow what uh
17:14
you should sleep more yes that's it you
17:16
should sleep more in school
17:18
no absolutely not i'm sorry
17:21
i didn't say that shh okay you should
17:24
achieve more in school
17:25
that makes sense okay that's the right
17:27
one don't sleep more in school okay i'm
17:29
just kidding
17:31
you should achieve more in school in
17:33
other words
17:34
you if somebody doesn't work hard enough
17:36
let's say your friend
17:38
is a little lazy they don't study hard
17:40
enough they get bad grades
17:42
on their on their tests you could say
17:44
you don't achieve
17:46
enough you should achieve more in school
17:49
you don't work hard enough okay so work
17:52
harder
17:52
achieve more okay number two
17:57
now don't forget number one you should
17:59
achieve more in school okay number two
18:01
that lady is beep she should be a movie
18:04
star
18:04
when you watch the movies when you when
18:06
you look at the movies
18:08
these days normally movies aren't really
18:10
real
18:11
right the people in the movies are
18:13
always
18:14
very good looking right especially it's
18:17
interesting when you look at movies
18:19
that are based on a true story right and
18:21
you look at the actors
18:23
the actors are always usually much
18:25
better looking
18:26
than the people who the story is based
18:28
on right that's very interesting
18:30
but you know that's part of
18:31
entertainment so what what can we say
18:33
that lady
18:34
is beyond beyond means she's further
18:37
away that doesn't make sense
18:39
she is beautiful ah she's beautiful
18:42
that's probably the right answer
18:44
she she is achieved you can't say
18:46
somebody is achieve
18:48
achieve is a verb not an adjective so
18:50
that doesn't make sense
18:51
that lady is perfectly no remember
18:53
perfectly describes a verb not a noun
18:57
so that wouldn't work if you said that
18:59
lady is perfect
19:00
that could be an answer but this is
19:02
perfectly so it doesn't fit
19:04
grammatically
19:05
the best answer of course is beautiful
19:07
like i said before
19:08
that's probably your answer that lady is
19:10
beautiful
19:11
she should be a movie star because
19:15
when we look at movies usually the
19:17
beautiful people
19:18
are the movie stars that's changing
19:20
recently nowadays
19:21
there are more and more people who look
19:23
like real people in the movies and
19:25
that's maybe a good thing too
19:27
because it really should be based on
19:28
talent not beauty
19:30
okay three the road
19:33
beep up ahead be ready to turn remember
19:36
when i talked about this i said if the
19:38
road is straight
19:39
you don't have to be so careful but if
19:41
the road
19:42
it does this right you have to be ready
19:45
to
19:46
turn right so what does the road do
19:49
does the road influences does it
19:51
achieves does it curves
19:53
does it fits the road of course
19:56
curves up ahead the road curves so be
19:59
ready to turn
20:01
remember a curve can be to the right or
20:03
inchokuro or it can be to the left
20:05
wenchokuro
20:06
or jayajan right still learning my
20:09
korean
20:10
okay so it can curve either direction to
20:12
the right
20:13
or to the left be ready to turn turn
20:15
right or turn left
20:17
okay four do you

20:47
do you know
20:48
if you have the information in your head
20:50
you have the answer
20:52
in your head then you know it if you
20:54

20:56
you're going to try to find it then you
20:58

do you know the information or don't you
21:06
know the information
21:07
do you know what the homework is for
21:09

21:10
and we can use many words here do you
21:13
know
21:14
how do you know where do you know
21:17
when do you know why do you know
21:21
who okay so we can use lots of these
21:23
question
21:24
words here after do you know and we want
21:27
to know if you know that information or
21:29
not do you know
21:30
how to get to school do you know where i
21:32

21:39

21:40
who our teacher is right if you know
21:42
this information
21:44
you can use these question words after
21:45
do you know to find
21:48
out that information from your friends
21:50
okay let's continue
21:52
no do you know what the homework is for
21:54
tonight okay next one number five
21:56
many people go to the new museum every
21:59
year
22:00
so when you go to a museum you go there
22:02
for a short time you don't live there
22:04
you don't stay there
22:05
you go there for a short time and then
22:07
you leave
22:08
so what types of what can we describe
22:12
that situation many environments
22:15
environments don't go to museums right
22:18
visitors ah visitors go for a short time
22:21
that's our answer
22:22
many visitors go to the new museum every
22:25
year
22:26
not faster not sea seashells go to the
22:28
museum
22:30
maybe there might be an exhibit on them
22:33
about seashells but they don't go there
22:34
every year that's kind of silly
22:36
okay let's move on to number six
22:40
where i live the beep is cold and snowy
22:44
so we're talking about the
22:47
area around you it can also be just
22:50
around you
22:50
or around your house it's the area in
22:53
which you live is
22:54
cold and snowy that's the space that
22:56
surrounds you
22:57
what word is that the furniture is cold
22:59
and snowy
23:00
furniture can't be snowy furniture can
23:03
be cold but not snowy
23:05
the the visitor is cold and snowy that
23:07
doesn't make sense
23:09
the environment ah the environment the
