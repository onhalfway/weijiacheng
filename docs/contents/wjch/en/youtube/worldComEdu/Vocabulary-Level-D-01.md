i hope to see you in level d soon
hello are you ready to begin with level

this book has many different subjects
that we are going to study

some topics
about science we'll also take a look at
social studies right
looking around the world in society

right what's healthy for you we'll also
take a look at
fine arts because that's an important
part of our lives isn't it
and of course math i'm sorry but we
should also take a look at math too
math can be exciting right and hopefully
we can study it in an exciting way
also we'll take a look at entertainment
i know that you
are excited about that aren't you okay
well
this these are the subjects that we will
cover in level d
reading for vocabulary hey kids
how are you doing it's nice to see you
again my name is brian stewart
and we are here to study from reading
for vocabulary
we're starting in level d on unit one
and our subject is architecture that's a
little bit of a
difficult word isn't it architecture
architecture our lesson one the title is
a dream job so when we think about that
what we're going to focus on is
what do you want to do in the future
have you thought about that let's think
about the job
architect architect okay
so that's what we're going to study in
this lesson let's begin
of course there are many different jobs
look at all these jobs can you find the
different names of the jobs
we don't have time to go over all of
them but we can just quickly we can see
there's a doctor
all right maybe there's a lawyer over
here there's an electrician
over here there are many different kinds
of jobs
when you think about your future what
kind of job
do you want well we're going to talk
about one
exciting job in this lesson okay but
let's talk about
a few vocabulary words first as you can
see here
a quick basic drawing can you draw
something like this are you a talented
artist if you
can draw like this you can make a sketch
this is a sketch it's a quick basic
drawing
now this doesn't look too basic this
looks a little complicated
but a quick drawing of something like
your house
a building your school that's a sketch
okay let's move on
this next word is to decide how
something will
look or work when people sit down and
they start to
think about how to draw something what
are they doing
right we can say that that is
design design we can use it as a verb
or as a noun what is the design of the
building or
he is going to design the building so we
can use it as a verb
or a noun a plan for making something
so this looks very complicated this is
not a
sketch this is a very detailed drawing
but it's a plan for making something
we call a blue print why is it blue
because the paper that they draw on
has a blue color and it's very technical
it's very detailed drawings of something
we say it's a blue
print a blueprint very technical or
detailed drawing of a building okay next
one
do you have a knife like that it's a
swiss army knife right
what something is used for what is
something used for
we can say what is its function if we
look at this knife
there are many different parts right
this
has a different function from this
this this knife its function is just to
cut
this pliers its function
is to hold something very tightly right
so
many things have different functions
what is the function
of this tool okay let's move on
oh warning you shouldn't smoke of course
you don't now
don't smoke in the future right a rule
or law
no smoking we see signs like this
many different places right no smoking
jucha kumji right
no parking right so we can say that's a
regulation
so we can call a rule a law or
regulation that's a hindura word right
regulation regulation
okay let's move on someone who works
with the law okay as you know we were
talking about
jobs before i pointed out somebody right
that was a lawyer right he was on the
side over there
a lawyer is someone who argues
for or against a position
in a court of law so they are called a
lawyer
there's somebody who argues for
something there's someone who argues
against something there's two lawyers
usually in a courtroom
at least two okay next one
what kind of crazy guy is that he's got
four arms
okay the state of being focused and
working hard
he doesn't really have four arms he's
just really busy
it looks like he has forums he's a
monster right okay
next uh this this word is dedication
if somebody is so focused on their work
they have a lot of focus and sometimes
when you do your homework you're like
this right you're very focused on your
homework
you want to do a good job you have
a lot of dedication okay that's like
you'll shim
but also energy and hard work it's
dedication
okay next one something that could
happen
okay something that could happen this is
a little bit of a dangerous position
right
possibility it's possible that she could
fall off
this is not a good idea okay so it's pos
it's a possibility something that could
happen but also
she's reading about maybe she's reading
about interesting stories and she's
saying
thinking is it possible that this could
happen maybe there's a night that she's
thinking about oh there's a knight in
shining armor
it's possible that one day i could meet
that person right
so it's a possibility what's possible in
the future
the next word have you been to one of
these do you like baseball
do you like soccer if you go to a sports
game
you will go to a large open building
where people watch
sports i hope you have the opportunity
to go to a place like this
what is this what kind of building is it
it's called a sports stadium
so we use two words sports stadium
okay so if you go there you can watch
your favorite baseball team or your
favorite soccer team
okay wow this looks like it's in
australia right the road is very
straight and doesn't curve and it's very
long we can see
really far having no end if something
has no end there's no end we say it's
end less because this
uh yeah i'll do that right there this
part of the word when you see that
less it means it doesn't have one and
less there's no end okay
endless the next one a
sudden dangerous situation okay of
course this is an
ambulance looks like somebody is hurt
what do we call that situation
we say it's an emergency it is
an emergency emergency
we can also use emergency as an
adjective it's an emergency vehicle
it's an emergency worker this is
emergency
services so emergency can be a noun
it is an emergency or it can be an
adjective it is emergency
services okay let's move on
to do the same as of course this is mama
duck and she has her baby ducks behind
her
what do baby ducks all birds right
really do this
when mama duck is walking along all the
little birds what do they do
they follow mama duck right to follow
if you do the same thing as somebody
else
you are following them to follow
okay next one maybe
okay put together in a smart and simple
way
so this person is putting together kind
of a complicated diagram
but he's thinking about how he puts it
together
so he's thinking about it in a smart way
and he's trying to make it
simple so what can we call that we say
that's
organized organized as an adjective
these plans are very organized right
we can also call people organized maybe
you know somebody in school who is
organized
they have all their books in the right
place all their pens in the other place
they're very neat they're very organized
okay next someone who designs
buildings and machines so this is a type
of job
this person is designing maybe a
building or a machine
what do we call that person we say that
that person is an
engineer engineer
so that person is an engineer
next one is working hard and completing
a lot of work
if you work really hard and you get a
lot of work done
what can we say we can say you you
are productive productive
you're productive are you productive at
night do you do all your homework really
quickly or do you play games
okay if you play games you are not
productive
but if you study hard and you get your
work done then you are
productive okay
next one is sad and having no energy
this person is happy
she has a lot of energy but these people
are not
they're sad what's going on they are
depressed
right they're sad about something if
something happens and it makes you sad
or it makes you
feel not very good we can say that you
are depressed
i hope that you don't get depressed if
you do get depressed
just think about the happy side just
think tomorrow is a new day
something good will happen so hopefully
we we aren't depressed
very long okay now let's begin with the
exercises okay
how well do you remember the words we
just
learned let's go over them um in this
exercise we need to choose the word that
best
completes the sentence our word choices
are here
and we need to fill the blank with these
word choices
so what is the sentence the sentence in
this case number one
do you think you could beep
our poster for our class so
what we're thinking about here is you're
going to be able to do something
can you can you beep our poster
for our class we need a verb all of some
of these are verbs
but some of them are nouns but we need a
verb here
because we want to do something to our
poster for art class
what will you do if you are a creative
person
maybe somebody wants you to create or
make an art poster a poster for art
class
so which word is similar to make or
create a listen that doesn't make sense
you want to listen to poster that
doesn't make sense
b function function's a noun it doesn't
doesn't make sense here design ah design
has the same meaning as make or create
that's our answer right blueprint as i
said before that's a noun
right so you don't blueprint a poster
you design a poster
so that's the answer do you think you
could design
our poster for art class
okay that's the answer there how about
number two
the question is or the sentence is i
looked
at your beep of the whale
it's really good for a new artist
so somebody did something right they
made
something that shows a whale
if you draw something or you make
something a picture right
of an object we can we can say that that
is a
picture or a drawing
or what is similar to drawing here we
have a blueprint
you make a blueprint of a whale no
because blueprint is for buildings right
you don't
make a blueprint of an animal that's
kind of weird you make a blueprint of a
building
if you're an architect or somebody who
designs buildings
b sketch ah we talked about this before
a sketch is a basic drawing so if you
very
quickly draw a picture of a whale that
is a sketch
and that's the answer b what are the
other ones
c site site is just a location
right site is like a place that doesn't
fit here
a place of the whale that doesn't make
sense i looked at your
emergency of the whale that doesn't make
sense at all right
so the only one that makes sense is
sketch i looked at your sketch
of the whale it's really good for a new
artist
that's our answer there let's move on to
number three
the question for number three is the
beep of the skull
is to protect the brain so remember when
we talked about that swiss army knife
that had many different tools
and we talked about what is the use of
each of those tools
everything has a use or what let's take
a look here
a blueprint the skull of course is the
bone in your head
right it's the hard bone what does it do
right
do we talk about the blueprint of the
skull is to protect the brain that
doesn't make sense
do we talk about the location of the
skull that doesn't make sense either
do we talk about the sketch of the skull
we're not talking about a drawing of
somebody's head we're talking about
the use or the function
what is its use you have a skull it's a
hard
bone in your head you can feel it right
now if you want to with me
right it's pretty hard what does it do
it protects
your brain your brain is inside your
skull it needs protection
so the skull's function is to protect
the brain
so the function of the skull is to
protect
the brain that's the function okay
number four
your son broke the law oh no that's
terrible
okay you need a beep okay
so if somebody breaks the law right that
person goes to
court and what do we find in court
remember there's two people
one for and one against right what type
of person do you need to help your son
do you need an engineer no an engineer
makes buildings and machines right so
that's not appropriate
we need a lawyer ah remember we talked
about lawyer
lawyers are the people in court one four
and one against
one is for the client one is against the
client or the person
who broke the law so we need a lawyer
if i hope not but if our son breaks the
law
then we need a lawyer c is
artist and d is architect right
an artist just draws pictures we don't
need them they can't help us
and architect designs buildings so they
can't help us
we need a lawyer okay
so that's the answer there your son
broke the law you need
a lawyer okay let's continue from number
five
there are many people to follow
when you drive a car now of course you
don't drive a car
but if your mom or dad is driving a car
and you're riding
remember look at the signs on the side
of the road
it says speed limit don't go too fast
it says you can't turn this way
those are rules or laws of the road
what is another word that means rule or
law let's take a look well a is
regulations that's our answer there
regulations so the answer is
there are many regulations to follow
when you drive a car
not sketches not emergencies and
sports stadiums that doesn't make any
sense the best
answer is regulations there are many
regulations
to follow when you drive a car six
if jim had more beep he would do better
in school
what does jim need to do better in
school what do you need
to do better in school does jim need
more anger
no don't be angry jim don't take that to
school
right get rid of it does he need
depression
no i hope jim is not depressed right if
he's sad
he won't do well in school does jim need
more anxiety anxiety means
worry now he maybe jim if jim worried
more he would do better in school that's
possible but a better answer is
dedication right so the better answer is
dedication
dedication means enthusiasm
you shim right he needs energy he needs
dedication
he needs to focus on his work if he had
more dedication
he would do better in school i hope you
have dedication too right
okay let's move on to its dedication of
course if jim had more dedication
he would do better in school let's move
on to number seven
there is a beep that it will rain
tomorrow
so when we're talking about tomorrow
there are many things that
could happen tomorrow rain is one of
those things that
it could happen so when we talk about
things that could happen we are talking
about what are we talking about a site
no remember site is a location a place
so it's not sight
is it possibility yes possibility
means something could happen there is a
possibility it is possible
i just use that word in a different way
you can do that
it is possible
okay so this word you can use it in
different ways
we say there is a possibility that's
noun
it is possible that's adjective
right so we use it in different ways and
these are very common ways
to use that word okay so there is a
possibility that it will rain tomorrow
okay number eight the beep for the new
school is
almost finished i'll send it to you
when i'm done this second sentence is
important why
because we're talking about something
for the new school
before a school is built you have to
draw
the design of that school what are we
looking at
we're looking at the function for the
new school that doesn't make sense
the site that could be the site for the
new school is almost finished the
location right maybe they
they pave the the the ground but the
next sentence
i'll send it to you how are you going to
send
a huge piece of ground to somebody that
doesn't make sense
next word is blueprint the blueprint ah
the drawings you can send
drawings that's no problem so blueprint
is right
the blueprint the design the plans
for the new school the blueprint is
almost
finished i'll send it to you no problem
not the sports stadium
again you can't send a sports stadium in
the mail they won't take it
okay but the best answer of course is
blueprint the blueprint for the new
school
is almost finished i'll send it to you
when i'm done okay well that wraps up
the vocabulary section
of this unit let's take a short break
we'll come back

again my name is brian stewart
02:10
and we are here to study from reading
02:13
for vocabulary
02:14
we're starting in level d on unit one
02:18
and our subject is architecture that's a
02:21
little bit of a
02:22
difficult word isn't it architecture
02:26
architecture our lesson one the title is
02:29
a dream job so when we think about that
02:33
what we're going to focus on is
02:35
what do you want to do in the future
02:39
have you thought about that let's think
02:42
about the job
02:43
architect architect okay
02:47
so that's what we're going to study in
02:48
this lesson let's begin
02:51
of course there are many different jobs
02:53
look at all these jobs can you find the
02:55
different names of the jobs
02:57
we don't have time to go over all of
02:59
them but we can just quickly we can see
03:01
there's a doctor
03:02
all right maybe there's a lawyer over
03:04
here there's an electrician
03:06
over here there are many different kinds
03:09
of jobs
03:10
when you think about your future what
03:12
kind of job
03:13
do you want well we're going to talk
03:15
about one
03:17
exciting job in this lesson okay but
03:20
let's talk about
03:21
a few vocabulary words first as you can
03:24
see here
03:25
a quick basic drawing can you draw
03:28
something like this are you a talented
03:30
artist if you
03:32
can draw like this you can make a sketch
03:35
this is a sketch it's a quick basic
03:37
drawing
03:38
now this doesn't look too basic this
03:40
looks a little complicated
03:41
but a quick drawing of something like
03:44
your house
03:45
a building your school that's a sketch
03:48
okay let's move on
03:50
this next word is to decide how
03:52
something will
03:53
look or work when people sit down and
03:56
they start to
03:57
think about how to draw something what
04:00
are they doing
04:00
right we can say that that is
04:04
design design we can use it as a verb
04:07
or as a noun what is the design of the
04:10
building or
04:11
he is going to design the building so we
04:14
can use it as a verb
04:15
or a noun a plan for making something
04:20
so this looks very complicated this is
04:23
not a
04:24
sketch this is a very detailed drawing
04:27
but it's a plan for making something
04:29
we call a blue print why is it blue
04:32
because the paper that they draw on
04:35
has a blue color and it's very technical
04:38
it's very detailed drawings of something
04:41
we say it's a blue
04:43
print a blueprint very technical or
04:46
detailed drawing of a building okay next
04:49
one
04:50
do you have a knife like that it's a
04:52
swiss army knife right
04:54
what something is used for what is
04:56
something used for
04:58
we can say what is its function if we
05:00
look at this knife
05:02
there are many different parts right
05:05
this
05:05
has a different function from this
05:09
this this knife its function is just to
05:12
cut
05:13
this pliers its function
05:16
is to hold something very tightly right
05:19
so
05:20
many things have different functions
05:23
what is the function
05:25
of this tool okay let's move on
05:28
oh warning you shouldn't smoke of course
05:31
you don't now
05:32
don't smoke in the future right a rule
05:35
or law
05:35
no smoking we see signs like this
05:39
many different places right no smoking
05:41
jucha kumji right
05:42
no parking right so we can say that's a
05:46
regulation
05:47
so we can call a rule a law or
05:50
regulation that's a hindura word right
05:53
regulation regulation
05:56
okay let's move on someone who works
06:00
with the law okay as you know we were
06:02
talking about
06:03
jobs before i pointed out somebody right
06:06
that was a lawyer right he was on the
06:09
side over there
06:10
a lawyer is someone who argues
06:13
for or against a position
06:17
in a court of law so they are called a
06:20
lawyer
06:20
there's somebody who argues for
06:22
something there's someone who argues
06:23
against something there's two lawyers
06:26
usually in a courtroom
06:27
at least two okay next one
06:30
what kind of crazy guy is that he's got
06:32
four arms
06:34
okay the state of being focused and
06:37
working hard
06:37
he doesn't really have four arms he's
06:39
just really busy
06:41
it looks like he has forums he's a
06:43
monster right okay
06:44
next uh this this word is dedication
06:48
if somebody is so focused on their work
06:52
they have a lot of focus and sometimes
06:54
when you do your homework you're like
06:56
this right you're very focused on your
06:57
homework
06:58

07:08
dedication
07:10
okay next one something that could
07:12
happen
07:13
okay something that could happen this is
07:15
a little bit of a dangerous position
07:17
right
07:18
possibility it's possible that she could
07:21
fall off
07:22
this is not a good idea okay so it's pos
07:26
it's a possibility something that could
07:28
happen but also
07:29
she's reading about maybe she's reading
07:31
about interesting stories and she's
07:33
saying
07:33
thinking is it possible that this could
07:35
happen maybe there's a night that she's
07:38
thinking about oh there's a knight in
07:39
shining armor
07:40
it's possible that one day i could meet
07:43
that person right
07:44
so it's a possibility what's possible in
07:47
the future
07:48
the next word have you been to one of
07:51
these do you like baseball
07:52
do you like soccer if you go to a sports
07:55
game
07:56
you will go to a large open building
07:59
where people watch
08:00
sports i hope you have the opportunity
08:03
to go to a place like this
08:04
what is this what kind of building is it
08:08
it's called a sports stadium
08:11
so we use two words sports stadium
08:15
okay so if you go there you can watch
08:18
your favorite baseball team or your
08:19
favorite soccer team
08:21
okay wow this looks like it's in
08:24
australia right the road is very
08:27
straight and doesn't curve and it's very
08:31
long we can see
08:32
really far having no end if something
08:36
has no end there's no end we say it's
08:39
end less because this
08:42
uh yeah i'll do that right there this
08:45
part of the word when you see that
08:46
less it means it doesn't have one and
08:50
less there's no end okay
08:53
endless the next one a
08:56
sudden dangerous situation okay of
08:59
course this is an
09:00
ambulance looks like somebody is hurt
09:02
what do we call that situation
09:04
we say it's an emergency it is
09:08
an emergency emergency
09:11
we can also use emergency as an
09:14
adjective it's an emergency vehicle
09:18
it's an emergency worker this is
09:21
emergency
09:23
services so emergency can be a noun
09:26
it is an emergency or it can be an
09:30
adjective it is emergency
09:33
services okay let's move on
09:37
to do the same as of course this is mama
09:39
duck and she has her baby ducks behind
09:42
her
09:42
what do baby ducks all birds right
09:45
really do this
09:46
when mama duck is walking along all the
09:48
little birds what do they do
09:50
they follow mama duck right to follow
09:54
if you do the same thing as somebody
09:57
else
09:57
you are following them to follow
10:01
okay next one maybe
10:04
okay put together in a smart and simple
10:08
way
10:09
so this person is putting together kind
10:11
of a complicated diagram
10:13
but he's thinking about how he puts it
10:17
together
10:18
so he's thinking about it in a smart way
10:20
and he's trying to make it
10:22
simple so what can we call that we say
10:25
that's
10:25
organized organized as an adjective
10:29
these plans are very organized right
10:32
we can also call people organized maybe
10:35
you know somebody in school who is
10:37
organized
10:38
they have all their books in the right
10:39
place all their pens in the other place
10:41
they're very neat they're very organized
10:44
okay next someone who designs
10:47
buildings and machines so this is a type
10:50
of job
10:51
this person is designing maybe a
10:54
building or a machine
10:55
what do we call that person we say that
10:58
that person is an
10:59
engineer engineer
11:02
so that person is an engineer
11:06
next one is working hard and completing
11:08
a lot of work
11:09
if you work really hard and you get a
11:11
lot of work done
11:12
what can we say we can say you you
11:16
are productive productive
11:20
you're productive are you productive at
11:23
night do you do all your homework really
11:25
quickly or do you play games
11:27
okay if you play games you are not
11:29
productive
11:30
but if you study hard and you get your
11:32
work done then you are
11:34
productive okay
11:37
next one is sad and having no energy
11:39
this person is happy
11:41
she has a lot of energy but these people
11:43
are not
11:44
they're sad what's going on they are
11:46
depressed
11:47
right they're sad about something if
11:50
something happens and it makes you sad
11:52
or it makes you
11:54
feel not very good we can say that you
11:57
are depressed
11:58
i hope that you don't get depressed if
11:59
you do get depressed
12:01
just think about the happy side just
12:03
think tomorrow is a new day
12:05
something good will happen so hopefully
12:07
we we aren't depressed
12:09
very long okay now let's begin with the
12:12
exercises okay
12:14
how well do you remember the words we
12:16
just
12:17
learned let's go over them um in this
12:20
exercise we need to choose the word that
12:22
best
12:23
completes the sentence our word choices
12:25
are here
12:26
and we need to fill the blank with these
12:28
word choices
12:29
so what is the sentence the sentence in
12:32
this case number one
12:34
do you think you could beep
12:37
our poster for our class so
12:40
what we're thinking about here is you're
12:42
going to be able to do something
12:45
can you can you beep our poster
12:48
for our class we need a verb all of some
12:51
of these are verbs
12:52
but some of them are nouns but we need a
12:55
verb here
12:56
because we want to do something to our
12:58
poster for art class
13:00
what will you do if you are a creative
13:04
person
13:04
maybe somebody wants you to create or
13:08
make an art poster a poster for art
13:11
class
13:11
so which word is similar to make or
13:14
create a listen that doesn't make sense
13:18
you want to listen to poster that
13:20
doesn't make sense
13:21
b function function's a noun it doesn't
13:24
doesn't make sense here design ah design
13:28
has the same meaning as make or create
13:31
that's our answer right blueprint as i
13:34
said before that's a noun
13:36
right so you don't blueprint a poster
13:38
you design a poster
13:39
so that's the answer do you think you
13:42
could design
13:43
our poster for art class
13:46
okay that's the answer there how about
13:48
number two
13:50
the question is or the sentence is i
13:52
looked
13:53
at your beep of the whale
13:56
it's really good for a new artist
13:59
so somebody did something right they
14:03
made
14:03
something that shows a whale
14:06
if you draw something or you make
14:09
something a picture right
14:11
of an object we can we can say that that
14:15
is a
14:16
picture or a drawing
14:19
or what is similar to drawing here we
14:21
have a blueprint
14:22
you make a blueprint of a whale no
14:24
because blueprint is for buildings right
14:27
you don't
14:27
make a blueprint of an animal that's
14:29
kind of weird you make a blueprint of a
14:32
building
14:32
if you're an architect or somebody who
14:35
designs buildings
14:37
b sketch ah we talked about this before
14:40
a sketch is a basic drawing so if you
14:43
very
14:44
quickly draw a picture of a whale that
14:46
is a sketch
14:47
and that's the answer b what are the
14:50
other ones
14:51
c site site is just a location
14:54
right site is like a place that doesn't
14:57
fit here
14:58
a place of the whale that doesn't make
14:59
sense i looked at your
15:01
emergency of the whale that doesn't make
15:03
sense at all right
15:04
so the only one that makes sense is
15:06
sketch i looked at your sketch
15:08
of the whale it's really good for a new
15:12
artist
15:13
that's our answer there let's move on to
15:15
number three
15:17
the question for number three is the
15:19
beep of the skull
15:20
is to protect the brain so remember when
15:23
we talked about that swiss army knife
15:25
that had many different tools
15:27
and we talked about what is the use of
15:30
each of those tools
15:31
everything has a use or what let's take
15:34
a look here
15:35
a blueprint the skull of course is the
15:38
bone in your head
15:39
right it's the hard bone what does it do
15:42
right
15:42
do we talk about the blueprint of the
15:44
skull is to protect the brain that
15:46
doesn't make sense
15:48
do we talk about the location of the
15:50
skull that doesn't make sense either
15:52
do we talk about the sketch of the skull
15:55
we're not talking about a drawing of
15:57
somebody's head we're talking about
15:59
the use or the function
16:03
what is its use you have a skull it's a
16:06
hard
16:06
bone in your head you can feel it right
16:08
now if you want to with me
16:09
right it's pretty hard what does it do
16:11
it protects
16:13
your brain your brain is inside your
16:15
skull it needs protection
16:17
so the skull's function is to protect
16:21
the brain
16:22
so the function of the skull is to
16:24
protect
16:25
the brain that's the function okay
16:28
number four
16:29
your son broke the law oh no that's
16:32
terrible
16:33
okay you need a beep okay
16:37
so if somebody breaks the law right that
16:40
person goes to
16:41
court and what do we find in court
16:43
remember there's two people
16:44
one for and one against right what type
16:48
of person do you need to help your son
16:50
do you need an engineer no an engineer
16:54
makes buildings and machines right so
16:56
that's not appropriate
16:57
we need a lawyer ah remember we talked
17:00
about lawyer
17:01
lawyers are the people in court one four
17:04
and one against
17:05
one is for the client one is against the
17:07
client or the person
17:08
who broke the law so we need a lawyer
17:12
if i hope not but if our son breaks the
17:14
law
17:15
then we need a lawyer c is
17:18
artist and d is architect right
17:22
an artist just draws pictures we don't
17:24
need them they can't help us
17:26
and architect designs buildings so they
17:28
can't help us
17:29
we need a lawyer okay
17:32
so that's the answer there your son
17:34
broke the law you need
17:36
a lawyer okay let's continue from number
17:39
five
17:40
there are many people to follow
17:43
when you drive a car now of course you
17:46
don't drive a car
17:48
but if your mom or dad is driving a car
17:51
and you're riding
17:52
remember look at the signs on the side
17:54
of the road
17:55
it says speed limit don't go too fast
17:58
it says you can't turn this way
18:01
those are rules or laws of the road
18:06
what is another word that means rule or
18:09
law let's take a look well a is
18:12
regulations that's our answer there
18:15
regulations so the answer is
18:16
there are many regulations to follow
18:19
when you drive a car
18:21
not sketches not emergencies and
18:24
sports stadiums that doesn't make any
18:26
sense the best
18:28
answer is regulations there are many
18:30
regulations
18:31
to follow when you drive a car six
18:35
if jim had more beep he would do better
18:38
in school
18:39
what does jim need to do better in
18:42
school what do you need
18:43
to do better in school does jim need
18:46
more anger
18:47
no don't be angry jim don't take that to
18:50
school
18:51
right get rid of it does he need
18:54
depression
18:55
no i hope jim is not depressed right if
18:58
he's sad
18:59
he won't do well in school does jim need
19:02
more anxiety anxiety means
19:05
worry now he maybe jim if jim worried
19:09
more he would do better in school that's
19:11
possible but a better answer is
19:14
dedication right so the better answer is
19:17
dedication
19:18
dedication means enthusiasm
19:21
you shim right he needs energy he needs
19:24
dedication
19:25
he needs to focus on his work if he had
19:28
more dedication
19:29
he would do better in school i hope you
19:31
have dedication too right
19:33
okay let's move on to its dedication of
19:35
course if jim had more dedication
19:37
he would do better in school let's move
19:40
on to number seven
19:41
there is a beep that it will rain
19:44
tomorrow
19:45
so when we're talking about tomorrow
19:47
there are many things that
19:49
could happen tomorrow rain is one of
19:53
those things that
19:54
it could happen so when we talk about
19:57
things that could happen we are talking
19:58
about what are we talking about a site
20:01
no remember site is a location a place
20:04
so it's not sight
20:05
is it possibility yes possibility
20:09
means something could happen there is a
20:12
possibility it is possible
20:16
i just use that word in a different way
20:18
you can do that
20:19
it is possible
20:25
okay so this word you can use it in
20:27
different ways
20:28
we say there is a possibility that's
20:32
noun
20:32
it is possible that's adjective
20:36
right so we use it in different ways and
20:38
these are very common ways
20:40
to use that word okay so there is a
20:43
possibility that it will rain tomorrow
20:47
okay number eight the beep for the new
20:50
school is
20:51
almost finished i'll send it to you
20:54
when i'm done this second sentence is
20:56
important why
20:57
because we're talking about something
21:00
for the new school
21:01
before a school is built you have to
21:03
draw
21:04
the design of that school what are we
21:07
looking at
21:08
we're looking at the function for the
21:09
new school that doesn't make sense
21:12
the site that could be the site for the
21:15
new school is almost finished the
21:17
location right maybe they
21:18
they pave the the the ground but the
21:21
next sentence
21:22
i'll send it to you how are you going to
21:25
send
21:25
a huge piece of ground to somebody that
21:28
doesn't make sense
21:29
next word is blueprint the blueprint ah
21:32
the drawings you can send
21:34
drawings that's no problem so blueprint
21:37
is right
21:37
the blueprint the design the plans
21:41
for the new school the blueprint is
21:44
almost
21:44
finished i'll send it to you no problem
21:46
not the sports stadium
21:48
again you can't send a sports stadium in
21:50
the mail they won't take it
21:51
okay but the best answer of course is
21:53
blueprint the blueprint for the new
21:55
school
21:55
is almost finished i'll send it to you
21:58
when i'm done okay well that wraps up
22:01
the vocabulary section
22:03
of this unit let's take a short break
22:05
we'll come back
22:06
and look at the reading
22:17
[Music]
22:18
you
