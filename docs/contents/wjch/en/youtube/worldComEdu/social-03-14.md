hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
we're looking at social studies book 3
lesson 14 and lesson 14 is about
our earth where we live so
in this lesson we will learn about the
different
parts of the globe and we will also
learn about different
areas on earth so let's get started
okay we always start with our vocabulary
section and the first word
in the vocabulary section is region
region region is the same as an area
it's an area that has shared
characteristics
shared characteristics what does that
mean characteristics
are qualities or things that are the
that are that you can say about
something adjectives
are usually used to describe
characteristics
for example if someone is tall that is a
characteristic about
that person if we talk about regions or
areas and we say it's rainy
they're a lot that is a characteristic
so
shared characteristics means that it's
an area
that the characteristics are true for
the whole area
and we can see that if we look at this
map for example
the southwest in america what are some
things
that are shared in this region well it's
characterized by deserts it's dry
it's hot there's it doesn't snow
during the winter those are
characteristics that's shared by the
entire region
and you can see that the region is
divided into states arizona new mexico
texas and
oklahoma and those areas do
share those same characteristics
we use the same adjectives to describe
all of those different states those
states
comprise or make up one region
and of course we have the different
regions
divided here you can divide a country by
region you can divide
the world by regions and that's kind of
what we're talking about
in this lesson another
word that's important for this lesson is
geography
geography is the study and research
of the earth's surface now here's a
little word to
remember this by geo geo
is a is a what we call a prefix a prefix
comes before the
the base word or what we call the root
word
and geo means earth so whenever you see
a word that starts with
geo you know that they're talking about
the earth for example geography
geography is
the study and research and making maps
of the earth's surface geology
is the study of the earth so geo
means earth okay good
our next word cardinal directions
cardinal just here means basic or
uh basic directions cardinal directions
are the four
basic right cardinal and basic are
similar the four
basic directions of north south east
and west i did that for me that was
opposite for you right
for you i think east is that way and
west is that way
right for me east is that way so it
flips around
but north and south okay so those are
the four
cardinal directions in other words the
four basic directions
there are other directions of course you
can combine them right
if you go in this direction you're going
north east
right by the way it's interesting if you
go this way it's
north north east right so those are not
cardinal directions those are getting
more complicated
right the four basic directions north
south east west
but when we talk about which direction
you should go sometimes people say
go north northeast or go south southwest
for example and that's in between those
four cardinal directions okay
intermediate directions that's what i
just talked about right
directions between the cardinal
directions and we see that on this map
northeast northwest southwest
and southeast those are the intermediate
directions
intermediate they come in between
the four cardinal directions and as i
said before you also have
you can also break it down even more
specifically and say north
east east right so you can also do that
okay to be more specific so cardinal
directions and
intermediate directions
the equator do you live near the equator
the equator is the middle of the earth
if you think about the earth as a big
basketball right going around in space
the line that goes around the center
right at the very um
middle of that basketball we call that
the equator
okay now that's an interesting idea it's
not real of course if you go there you
won't see a line on the ground that's
kind of crazy but it's an imaginary line
we
when we think about our environment you
know as human beings we like to divide
things we like to
measure things we like to give names to
certain
features of our environment of our
surroundings
and so we have given the imaginary idea
of an equator
it's an imaginary line around the middle
of the earth
and it goes like this and you'll notice
that it's interesting it's not
straight up and down right because the
earth as we learned in a science lesson
before
is actually tilted so the the line will
uh go around like this but it's at the
it's at the fattest
part of the earth you could say that
because you know the earth isn't
actually
a perfectly round sphere
it's more it's kind of fat around the
middle because of the way it spins
okay and the and the gravity that's
exerted on it
so it kind of bulges out a little bit at
the middle
but at that area we call it the equator
and the equator
separates the north and the south part
of the earth so if you are north of the
equator
you are in the northern hemisphere south
of the equator you're in the southern
hemisphere we'll see those ideas again
now on the pole that is as far away from
the
equator as you can get there are two
poles of course right there's only one
equator because there's only one
middle but the poles are at the top and
the bottom
of the earth okay so the pole is the
most
northern or southern points of
the earth okay and it's interesting
because
it says here the most northern or
southern points of the earth that's one
way to look at the
north pole and the south pole because
there are different poles actually
there is the magnetic pole and then
there is the uh
the physical north pole the actual top
of the earth and they're different
the magnetic north pole is quite far off
from the
actual most northern point or the top of
the globe
okay so that's interesting but the pole
we say the north pole
and the south pole they're as far away
from the equator as you can get
to divide divide is to separate into two
parts here we have a picture of a piece
of bread
sandwich bread it looks like and if you
you know kind of tear it apart you got
to be careful
i would use a knife but anyway if you
don't have a knife you just tear it
apart carefully
you divide it one for you one for me
that's to share now you don't always
divide things to share them
the equator divides the earth into two
parts i said
the northern hemisphere and the southern
hemisphere the equator will divide
or to separate the thing whether it's
the earth or a piece of bread
you divide it you separate it into two
parts
okay hemisphere now
as i said we're going to talk about this
in a little bit so the northern
hemisphere as i said
here is the equator right this line here
is the equator
now we have the northern hemisphere
anything north of that line
is in the northern hemisphere okay
and anything south of this line
is the southern hemisphere hemi means
half sphere is a
three-dimensional round ball so
hemisphere
is half of that right it's the top half
the northern
half of that the northern hemisphere and
again
for the southern hemisphere same idea
right
the southern half sphere is basically
what we're saying
so it's the southern hemisphere and the
northern hemisphere
hemisphere hemi half of the sphere
hemi is half right and it's right here
actually
a half of the earth that is cut
according to the equator
again the equator is the dividing line
it is the line that divides north
from south okay
okay those are our words for today
let's talk about the main ideas for this
unit and the first main idea is the
parts of a globe
we've already discussed some of these
already when we were discussing
vocabulary and as we saw we can see the
northern hemisphere
and the southern hemisphere so those are
you know two important parts of a globe
of course another part is the equator
now what are the characteristics of
these different regions
well first of all the equator if you
live on
or near the equator the regions around
the equator
your climate is probably quite warm it
might rain a lot
right depending on where you live it
might you might live in a rain forest
or you might live in a desert right
regions around the equator are warm
there are many kinds of plant
and animal life now that's also very
interesting if we think about
biology because around the equator
right this region around the equator
it's not just the equator
but it's also you know hundreds of
kilometers north of the equator
and hundreds of kilometers south of the
equator that is where
most of the diverse species
live why because it's warm there's lots
of water
and there's more sunlight more chances
for plant
and animal growth so the most
diversity of animal species is around
the equator there are many kinds of
plant and animal life
the further north you go the number of
animal species
declines okay
north and south pole the north and south
pole regions we're talking about these
areas these are the north pole
and the south pole regions of course
they're very cold
right animals in the polar regions
have thick fur so of course you've heard
of polar bears right polar bears have
very thick
fur and they run around up there now
there are no polar bears in the southern
pole
but there are penguins penguins don't
have thick fur but they do have thick
feathers right and they have thick skin
that keeps them warm
so animals at the north and the south
pole have to develop some sort of
natural coat right to keep them warm
and to keep their body heat next to
their body
each region on earth each region on
earth has its
own landforms and climates
right as we talked about before around
the equator it's
warm depending on whether you live in
the desert or the rain forest it could
rain a whole lot
or maybe it doesn't rain at all that's
different climate
of course in the north and south poles
it's
snows a lot there's a lot of snow
there's a lot of ice
so they have their own climate they also
have their own landforms
in the north pole the true north pole
there's no land it's just
ice but it kind of forms like a land
but it's melting every year it seems to
melt more and more
in this winter time though it is covered
with ice in the south pole as you know
there's a continent
antarctica right and that has uh
so that is land even if it if even if
all the ice melted on antarctica
which we hope it doesn't there would
still be land there
okay interesting another idea from this
unit
is that there are different kinds of
regions and i talked about this
just a little bit just on the previous
idea right we talked about
tropical regions a tropical region i
mentioned
rain forests these are near the equator
you see them in places like south
america very famous
tropical region is along the amazon
river
it's not at the equator it's south of
the equator but it's kind of
close and this area gets a lot of rain
there's a lot of there's a lot of
vegetation a lot of plants
and of course if there's a lot of plants
there's a lot of animals that can use
those plants for food
and shelter so like i said near the
equator
the animal species uh the number and
quantity
of animal species rises quite a lot
now there's also a desert region desert
regions
have no rain or very little rain it
rains but
not very often it's very dry and
strange plants grow right
that's a saguaro right that's a cactus a
type of cactus
that can grow very tall taller than your
house
and they're very heavy but they hold
water inside of them
so that's a desert region polar region
of course polar
polar we're talking about the poles
north pole south pole
it's very cold there's a lot of ice
there's a lot of snow
and you need to have warm clothing if
you're in the
if you're at the north or south pole
because it's very very cold
i get cold just looking at the picture
also we have we could say there's a
mountain region right
so it's not just climates it could also
be landforms
mountains valleys well desert is usually
flat
but you could have deserts high up in
the mountains too
but a mountain region is just an area
characterized by many mountains
the andes the andes mountain range
running through
south america it's also the rocky
mountains running through
the western united states and of course
the alps running through switzerland
very famous
so these are mountain regions can't
forget the himalayas right
very famous mountain region okay so
those are different kinds of regions
on the earth now it's time for the
reading section so
as always read along with me in your
head or
read it long out loud practice the
pronunciation
and remember the words that we talked
about
okay you ready here we go
our earth has many different regions
each region on earth has its own
landforms
climate and plant life
you can see the differences in geography
lessons
traveling in cardinal and intermediate
directions
you can see changes in the land forms
the earth is divided into the northern
and southern hemispheres by the
equator a hemisphere
is the half of the earth
northern hemisphere and southern
hemisphere
okay the equator gets a lot of sunlight
all year round therefore
around the equator the climate is warm
and there are many kinds of animal and
plant
life sorry there are many kinds of plant
and
animal life okay
but the south and north pole
regions do not get much sunlight
and the climate is very cold
okay in these regions
animals need thick fur to protect
themselves
from the cold the climate is cold
and there is not a lot of plant or
animal life okay
let's talk about the organization of the
information
in the reading and in this case we are
using the
organizational pattern of compare
and contrast now when we talked about
the globe we talked about
two main regions right we talked about
the equator
that's at the middle of the earth and we
talked about the polar regions
so we can divide those regions
and compare and contrast those compare
is when you say how things are similar
contrast is when you say how things are
different
of course in this reading passage we
mostly talked about
how these two areas are different
so let's take a look at it around the
equator
the climate is what it's
warm the climate is warm
because as they said it gets a lot of
sunlight
the equator is always that actually the
daytime
the amount of sun and night is usually
the same around the equator you usually
get about 12 hours of daylight
12 hours of night but at the polls
you know sometimes you get a lot of
sunlight but sometimes you get no
sunlight at all depending on the season
and what pole you're at so in the north
and south
poles the climate is cold
very cold burr
okay so there are
uh that's the difference that's the main
difference the climate is warm around
the equator
the climate is cold around this north
and south poles what is that
effect what's the effect of that well
the effect of that is that there are
many kinds of
plant and animal life around
the equator and there is not a lot of
plant or animal life
around the south or north poles there's
not a lot of them okay
so each region on earth has its
own landforms climate
and plant life landforms land
forms and land forms like we talked
about deserts
tropical areas polar regions mountainous
regions
these are land forms so each region on
earth has its own landforms
climate and plant life and of course
animal life as well
okay well that wraps up our lesson for
today uh it's interesting to think about
that
what kind of region do you live on the
earth do you live near the equator
or are you further north or further
south i don't think you live in the
polar regions not many people do
but hopefully you live in a nice climate
you can enjoy the outdoors
and of course when you get older or even
now
if your parents agree you can take
trips to different parts of the earth
and see the different
land forms the different plant life and
the different types of climate
by yourself okay so that would be really
that would be like a little adventure
something to look forward to okay well i
hope you enjoyed studying with me and
we'll see you in the next one
take care everybody bye bye

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading
00:11
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
00:13
we're looking at social studies book 3
00:16
lesson 14 and lesson 14 is about
00:20
our earth where we live so
00:23
in this lesson we will learn about the
00:26
different
00:26
parts of the globe and we will also
00:30
learn about different
00:31
areas on earth so let's get started
00:35
okay we always start with our vocabulary
00:37
section and the first word
00:39
in the vocabulary section is region
00:43
region region is the same as an area
00:46
it's an area that has shared
00:49
characteristics
00:51
shared characteristics what does that
00:53
mean characteristics
00:55
are qualities or things that are the
00:58
that are that you can say about
01:00
something adjectives
01:02
are usually used to describe
01:05
characteristics
01:06
for example if someone is tall that is a
01:09
characteristic about
01:10
that person if we talk about regions or
01:14
areas and we say it's rainy
01:17
they're a lot that is a characteristic
01:20
so
01:21
shared characteristics means that it's
01:23
an area
01:24
that the characteristics are true for
01:26
the whole area
01:27
and we can see that if we look at this
01:29
map for example
01:31
the southwest in america what are some
01:34
things
01:35
that are shared in this region well it's
01:38
characterized by deserts it's dry
01:41
it's hot there's it doesn't snow
01:45
during the winter those are
01:46
characteristics that's shared by the
01:49
entire region
01:50
and you can see that the region is
01:52
divided into states arizona new mexico
01:55
texas and
01:56
oklahoma and those areas do
01:59
share those same characteristics
02:02
we use the same adjectives to describe
02:05
all of those different states those
02:08
states
02:09
comprise or make up one region
02:12
and of course we have the different
02:14
regions
02:15
divided here you can divide a country by
02:18
region you can divide
02:19
the world by regions and that's kind of
02:22
what we're talking about
02:23
in this lesson another
02:26
word that's important for this lesson is
02:29
geography
02:31
geography is the study and research
02:35
of the earth's surface now here's a
02:37
little word to
02:38
remember this by geo geo
02:43
is a is a what we call a prefix a prefix
02:46
comes before the
02:48
the base word or what we call the root
02:50
word
02:51
and geo means earth so whenever you see
02:54
a word that starts with
02:55
geo you know that they're talking about
02:58
the earth for example geography
03:01
geography is
03:02
the study and research and making maps
03:06
of the earth's surface geology
03:09
is the study of the earth so geo
03:12
means earth okay good
03:17
our next word cardinal directions
03:21
cardinal just here means basic or
03:24
uh basic directions cardinal directions
03:27
are the four
03:28
basic right cardinal and basic are
03:30
similar the four
03:31
basic directions of north south east
03:35
and west i did that for me that was
03:37
opposite for you right
03:38
for you i think east is that way and
03:40
west is that way
03:42
right for me east is that way so it
03:44
flips around
03:45
but north and south okay so those are
03:48
the four
03:49
cardinal directions in other words the
03:51
four basic directions
03:52
there are other directions of course you
03:54
can combine them right
03:56
if you go in this direction you're going
03:59
north east
04:00
right by the way it's interesting if you
04:02
go this way it's
04:04
north north east right so those are not
04:07
cardinal directions those are getting
04:08
more complicated
04:10
right the four basic directions north
04:12
south east west
04:13
but when we talk about which direction
04:15
you should go sometimes people say
04:17
go north northeast or go south southwest
04:20
for example and that's in between those
04:24
four cardinal directions okay
04:28
intermediate directions that's what i
04:31
just talked about right
04:32
directions between the cardinal
04:34
directions and we see that on this map
04:37
northeast northwest southwest
04:40
and southeast those are the intermediate
04:43
directions
04:44
intermediate they come in between
04:47
the four cardinal directions and as i
04:50
said before you also have
04:52
you can also break it down even more
04:54
specifically and say north
04:56
east east right so you can also do that
05:00
okay to be more specific so cardinal
05:03
directions and
05:04
intermediate directions
05:07
the equator do you live near the equator
05:10
the equator is the middle of the earth
05:13
if you think about the earth as a big
05:15
basketball right going around in space
05:20
the line that goes around the center
05:22
right at the very um
05:24
middle of that basketball we call that
05:27
the equator
05:29
okay now that's an interesting idea it's
05:31
not real of course if you go there you
05:33
won't see a line on the ground that's
05:35
kind of crazy but it's an imaginary line
05:38
we
05:39
when we think about our environment you
05:41
know as human beings we like to divide
05:43
things we like to
05:44
measure things we like to give names to
05:48
certain
05:49
features of our environment of our
05:51
surroundings
05:52
and so we have given the imaginary idea
05:55
of an equator
05:57
it's an imaginary line around the middle
05:59
of the earth
06:01
and it goes like this and you'll notice
06:02
that it's interesting it's not
06:04
straight up and down right because the
06:06
earth as we learned in a science lesson
06:08
before
06:08
is actually tilted so the the line will
06:12
uh go around like this but it's at the
06:14
it's at the fattest
06:16
part of the earth you could say that
06:18
because you know the earth isn't
06:19
actually
06:20
a perfectly round sphere
06:23
it's more it's kind of fat around the
06:26
middle because of the way it spins
06:28
okay and the and the gravity that's
06:30
exerted on it
06:32
so it kind of bulges out a little bit at
06:34
the middle
06:35
but at that area we call it the equator
06:37
and the equator
06:38
separates the north and the south part
06:41
of the earth so if you are north of the
06:44
equator
06:45
you are in the northern hemisphere south
06:47
of the equator you're in the southern
06:48
hemisphere we'll see those ideas again
06:52
now on the pole that is as far away from
06:55
the
06:56
equator as you can get there are two
06:59
poles of course right there's only one
07:00
equator because there's only one
07:02
middle but the poles are at the top and
07:04
the bottom
07:05
of the earth okay so the pole is the
07:08
most
07:08
northern or southern points of
07:12
the earth okay and it's interesting
07:14
because
07:15
it says here the most northern or
07:18
southern points of the earth that's one
07:20
way to look at the
07:21
north pole and the south pole because
07:24
there are different poles actually
07:26
there is the magnetic pole and then
07:28
there is the uh
07:30
the physical north pole the actual top
07:33
of the earth and they're different
07:34
the magnetic north pole is quite far off
07:37
from the
07:38
actual most northern point or the top of
07:41
the globe
07:42
okay so that's interesting but the pole
07:44
we say the north pole
07:45
and the south pole they're as far away
07:47
from the equator as you can get
07:51
to divide divide is to separate into two
07:54
parts here we have a picture of a piece
07:56
of bread
07:56
sandwich bread it looks like and if you
07:59
you know kind of tear it apart you got
08:00
to be careful
08:01
i would use a knife but anyway if you
08:03
don't have a knife you just tear it
08:04
apart carefully
08:05
you divide it one for you one for me
08:09
that's to share now you don't always
08:11
divide things to share them
08:12
the equator divides the earth into two
08:16
parts i said
08:17
the northern hemisphere and the southern
08:19
hemisphere the equator will divide
08:22
or to separate the thing whether it's
08:26
the earth or a piece of bread
08:28
you divide it you separate it into two
08:31
parts
08:32
okay hemisphere now
08:35
as i said we're going to talk about this
08:36
in a little bit so the northern
08:38
hemisphere as i said
08:39
here is the equator right this line here
08:41
is the equator
08:42
now we have the northern hemisphere
08:44
anything north of that line
08:47
is in the northern hemisphere okay
08:50
and anything south of this line
08:53
is the southern hemisphere hemi means
08:57
half sphere is a
09:00
three-dimensional round ball so
09:03
hemisphere
09:04
is half of that right it's the top half
09:06
the northern
09:07
half of that the northern hemisphere and
09:10
again
09:11
for the southern hemisphere same idea
09:13
right
09:14
the southern half sphere is basically
09:17
what we're saying
09:18
so it's the southern hemisphere and the
09:20
northern hemisphere
09:21
hemisphere hemi half of the sphere
09:24
hemi is half right and it's right here
09:27
actually
09:28
a half of the earth that is cut
09:30
according to the equator
09:33
again the equator is the dividing line
09:36
it is the line that divides north
09:39
from south okay
09:42
okay those are our words for today
09:47
let's talk about the main ideas for this
09:50
unit and the first main idea is the
09:52
parts of a globe
09:53
we've already discussed some of these
09:54
already when we were discussing
09:56
vocabulary and as we saw we can see the
09:59
northern hemisphere
10:00
and the southern hemisphere so those are
10:04
you know two important parts of a globe
10:07
of course another part is the equator
10:09
now what are the characteristics of
10:12
these different regions
10:13
well first of all the equator if you
10:15
live on
10:16
or near the equator the regions around
10:19
the equator
10:20
your climate is probably quite warm it
10:23
might rain a lot
10:25
right depending on where you live it
10:26
might you might live in a rain forest
10:29
or you might live in a desert right
10:32
regions around the equator are warm
10:34
there are many kinds of plant
10:36
and animal life now that's also very
10:38
interesting if we think about
10:40
biology because around the equator
10:43
right this region around the equator
10:45
it's not just the equator
10:46
but it's also you know hundreds of
10:49
kilometers north of the equator
10:50
and hundreds of kilometers south of the
10:52
equator that is where
10:54
most of the diverse species
10:57
live why because it's warm there's lots
11:00
of water
11:01
and there's more sunlight more chances
11:04
for plant
11:05
and animal growth so the most
11:09
diversity of animal species is around
11:11
the equator there are many kinds of
11:13
plant and animal life
11:14
the further north you go the number of
11:17
animal species
11:18
declines okay
11:21
north and south pole the north and south
11:23
pole regions we're talking about these
11:25
areas these are the north pole
11:27
and the south pole regions of course
11:29
they're very cold
11:30
right animals in the polar regions
11:34
have thick fur so of course you've heard
11:36
of polar bears right polar bears have
11:38
very thick
11:39
fur and they run around up there now
11:42
there are no polar bears in the southern
11:44
pole
11:45
but there are penguins penguins don't
11:46
have thick fur but they do have thick
11:49
feathers right and they have thick skin
11:51
that keeps them warm
11:53
so animals at the north and the south
11:55
pole have to develop some sort of
11:57
natural coat right to keep them warm
12:00
and to keep their body heat next to
12:03
their body
12:04
each region on earth each region on
12:08
earth has its
12:09
own landforms and climates
12:12
right as we talked about before around
12:15
the equator it's
12:15
warm depending on whether you live in
12:18
the desert or the rain forest it could
12:20
rain a whole lot
12:21
or maybe it doesn't rain at all that's
12:24
different climate
12:25
of course in the north and south poles
12:27
it's
12:29
snows a lot there's a lot of snow
12:30
there's a lot of ice
12:32
so they have their own climate they also
12:34
have their own landforms
12:36
in the north pole the true north pole
12:39
there's no land it's just
12:40
ice but it kind of forms like a land
12:43
but it's melting every year it seems to
12:46
melt more and more
12:49
in this winter time though it is covered
12:51
with ice in the south pole as you know
12:53
there's a continent
12:54
antarctica right and that has uh
12:58
so that is land even if it if even if
13:01
all the ice melted on antarctica
13:03
which we hope it doesn't there would
13:05
still be land there
13:07
okay interesting another idea from this
13:11
unit
13:11
is that there are different kinds of
13:13
regions and i talked about this
13:14
just a little bit just on the previous
13:16
idea right we talked about
13:18
tropical regions a tropical region i
13:21
mentioned
13:22
rain forests these are near the equator
13:26
you see them in places like south
13:28
america very famous
13:30
tropical region is along the amazon
13:32
river
13:34
it's not at the equator it's south of
13:36
the equator but it's kind of
13:37
close and this area gets a lot of rain
13:41
there's a lot of there's a lot of
13:43
vegetation a lot of plants
13:45
and of course if there's a lot of plants
13:47
there's a lot of animals that can use
13:49
those plants for food
13:50
and shelter so like i said near the
13:53
equator
13:54
the animal species uh the number and
13:57
quantity
13:58
of animal species rises quite a lot
14:02
now there's also a desert region desert
14:05
regions
14:05
have no rain or very little rain it
14:08
rains but
14:09
not very often it's very dry and
14:12
strange plants grow right
14:16
that's a saguaro right that's a cactus a
14:18
type of cactus
14:19
that can grow very tall taller than your
14:22
house
14:23
and they're very heavy but they hold
14:25
water inside of them
14:26
so that's a desert region polar region
14:29
of course polar
14:30
polar we're talking about the poles
14:32
north pole south pole
14:33
it's very cold there's a lot of ice
14:36
there's a lot of snow
14:37
and you need to have warm clothing if
14:40
you're in the
14:41
if you're at the north or south pole
14:43
because it's very very cold
14:46
i get cold just looking at the picture
14:48
also we have we could say there's a
14:50
mountain region right
14:51
so it's not just climates it could also
14:53
be landforms
14:54
mountains valleys well desert is usually
14:57
flat
14:58
but you could have deserts high up in
15:00
the mountains too
15:02
but a mountain region is just an area
15:04
characterized by many mountains
15:06
the andes the andes mountain range
15:09
running through
15:09
south america it's also the rocky
15:13
mountains running through
15:14
the western united states and of course
15:17
the alps running through switzerland
15:19
very famous
15:20
so these are mountain regions can't
15:23
forget the himalayas right
15:25
very famous mountain region okay so
15:27
those are different kinds of regions
15:29
on the earth now it's time for the
15:32
reading section so
15:34
as always read along with me in your
15:36
head or
15:37
read it long out loud practice the
15:39
pronunciation
15:40
and remember the words that we talked
15:43
about
15:43
okay you ready here we go
15:47
our earth has many different regions
15:52
each region on earth has its own
15:55
landforms
15:56
climate and plant life
16:00
you can see the differences in geography
16:03
lessons
16:07
traveling in cardinal and intermediate
16:10
directions
16:12
you can see changes in the land forms
16:17
the earth is divided into the northern
16:21
and southern hemispheres by the
16:24
equator a hemisphere
16:28
is the half of the earth
16:32
northern hemisphere and southern
16:35
hemisphere
16:36
okay the equator gets a lot of sunlight
16:42
all year round therefore
16:45
around the equator the climate is warm
16:48
and there are many kinds of animal and
16:51
plant
16:52
life sorry there are many kinds of plant
16:55
and
16:55
animal life okay
17:00
but the south and north pole
17:03
regions do not get much sunlight
17:07
and the climate is very cold
17:11
okay in these regions
17:15
animals need thick fur to protect
17:18
themselves
17:19
from the cold the climate is cold
17:22
and there is not a lot of plant or
17:26
animal life okay
17:30
let's talk about the organization of the
17:32
information
17:33
in the reading and in this case we are
17:35
using the
17:37
organizational pattern of compare
17:40
and contrast now when we talked about
17:42
the globe we talked about
17:44
two main regions right we talked about
17:46
the equator
17:47
that's at the middle of the earth and we
17:49
talked about the polar regions
17:51
so we can divide those regions
17:54
and compare and contrast those compare
17:58
is when you say how things are similar
18:02
contrast is when you say how things are
18:04
different
18:05
of course in this reading passage we
18:07
mostly talked about
18:09
how these two areas are different
18:12
so let's take a look at it around the
18:14
equator
18:15
the climate is what it's
18:19
warm the climate is warm
18:22
because as they said it gets a lot of
18:25
sunlight
18:26
the equator is always that actually the
18:29
daytime
18:30
the amount of sun and night is usually
18:32
the same around the equator you usually
18:34
get about 12 hours of daylight
18:36
12 hours of night but at the polls
18:39
you know sometimes you get a lot of
18:40
sunlight but sometimes you get no
18:42
sunlight at all depending on the season
18:44
and what pole you're at so in the north
18:47
and south
18:48
poles the climate is cold
18:51
very cold burr
18:54
okay so there are
18:58
uh that's the difference that's the main
19:00
difference the climate is warm around
19:01
the equator
19:02
the climate is cold around this north
19:04
and south poles what is that
19:06
effect what's the effect of that well
19:07
the effect of that is that there are
19:09
many kinds of
19:10
plant and animal life around
19:13
the equator and there is not a lot of
19:17
plant or animal life
19:20
around the south or north poles there's
19:22
not a lot of them okay
19:24
so each region on earth has its
19:27
own landforms climate
19:30
and plant life landforms land
19:34
forms and land forms like we talked
19:37
about deserts
19:40
tropical areas polar regions mountainous
19:43
regions
19:43
these are land forms so each region on
19:45
earth has its own landforms
19:47
climate and plant life and of course
19:50
animal life as well
19:52
okay well that wraps up our lesson for
19:55
today uh it's interesting to think about
19:57
that
19:57
what kind of region do you live on the
20:00
earth do you live near the equator
20:01
or are you further north or further
20:03
south i don't think you live in the
20:04
polar regions not many people do
20:07
but hopefully you live in a nice climate
20:09
you can enjoy the outdoors
20:11
and of course when you get older or even
20:14
now
20:14
if your parents agree you can take
20:17
trips to different parts of the earth
20:19
and see the different
20:20
land forms the different plant life and
20:23
the different types of climate
20:25
by yourself okay so that would be really
20:28
that would be like a little adventure
20:30
something to look forward to okay well i
20:32
hope you enjoyed studying with me and
20:33
we'll see you in the next one
20:35
take care everybody bye bye
