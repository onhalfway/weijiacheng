hello everybody how are you today
welcome back to american textbook
reading
i'm brian stewart today we're studying
from science book
number three and we're on lesson five
plant adaptations so we're taking a look
at how plants have
changed over time and over
different environments so you will
discover how plants
change and the types of environments
in which plants live there are many
different environments we'll talk about
those in
the unit today so as usual let's begin
with the vocabulary
what are the words that we can use to
help us talk about these things
first we can see harry
hairy plants can plants be hairy
normally when we think about hair right
we think about the hair
on our heads or the hair on an animal
like a dog
or a horse right but hairy plants
yes it's possible that some plants seem
to have
hair we'll see that okay so hairy means
having a lot of
hair but plants of course don't have
hair
but it may look like they have hair so
we'll see that in a little while so
hairy flat
flat is you could say maybe
some people probably say boring
countryside sorry
if you live in a flat area but flat just
means
that the land is flat
there's no change it doesn't go down it
doesn't go up
there are no mountains no valleys it's
just flat
a flat land having no high or curved
parts
or curved i guess would be curved in the
land like this
no it's all flat so if you live in an
area like
farmland many people live in farmland
where the farms need to be flat
so it's easy for the farmer to grow
plants there
many states in america are famous for
being flat
like kansas nebraska
now people in kansas and nebraska might
get mad at me but i'm sorry
but you know i i grew up in
mostly western states there are many
mountains there it's not flat you know
you have huge mountains
so um injured but there are many parts
of the area country
that are flat and that's just what it
means no mountains no valleys flat
lose lose i hope you don't experience
this but
it's part of life usually we lose
something you can't avoid it
lose means you do not have something any
longer
right if you have something in your hand
like
coins or your favorite toy uh
and it drops out of your hand maybe
you're not paying attention
you you lose it somewhere like oh no
where did it go
i can't find it i lost it right that
means
it uh to lose means that you have
lost the thing that you had before
it also happens in the environment in
this picture lose what does this picture
have to do with
lose well maybe they're talking about
water over time
the land has lost the water so that
could be
an idea for this picture okay
freeze in the winter time
we know this word very well that's when
it becomes
so cold that water changes
from a liquid to a solid
it becomes hard and solid because the
temperature
goes below zero degrees celsius
that is the temperature at which water
turns from liquid to ice right
and ice is a hard cold substance right
it's solid
right so to freeze that's basically what
it means to freeze of course it's very
cold
to do that of course in your home you
can find an example of freezing
just go to your refrigerator and open
the freezer side
of your refrigerator not the
refrigerator side that's just cold
open the freezer part where it's really
cold and you keep
ice and your mom keeps the food that's
frozen
for later okay good
here we have a video uh or yeah a video
of something freezing well actually
i could say this is melting really this
is the opposite of freezing
but it's hard to show a video of
freezing because you know it's
you have to sit there and watch it and
you may not notice the change
very quickly but here we have a picture
of many what do we call these things
by the way when water drips down and
it's so cold that it
it freezes as it's dripping down that's
an
interesting word we call these things
here we call them
ice cold and there's more than one so we
say
i circled two so icicles is the plural
but ice ice icicles like ice
and ickle not a popsicle popsicles those
are delicious
but popsicles are frozen fruit uh
drink right uh instead of drinking the
fruit juice you
freeze it and it becomes a popsicle
ah you see the similar similarity in the
words popsicle is
frozen fruit drink so if you have a
grape popsicle
or a watermelon popsicle right that's
frozen watermelon juice
and it's nice to eat on a hot summer day
but
that's that liquid has frozen
into these shapes in this case icicle
okay our next word is conserve
very important word conserve means to
save
right to keep and protect from loss
or waste same as i said to
save save it don't
waste it waste is the opposite of
conserve
you don't want to waste clean water
unfortunately clean water is rare
in some parts of the world some people
have a hard time
getting clean water that they can drink
and we don't want to waste
our resources we want to conserve them
we want to keep them
just use them when you need them don't
just waste them because
one day they may not be available so
easily
and it may be difficult to get them so
we should conserve
and we should keep and protect the
things that are valuable
to us so conserve save or to keep
okay environment of course we should
protect the environment
people can say conserve the environment
save the environment
keep the environment clean so
the environment is the natural world
it's the world that's around you
although yeah that's what
many people normally the traditional old
thinking of the environment is the
natural world
but environment can also mean uh an
industrial or city
that's also an environment you can say
urban environment
that would be a city environment so
environment isn't just the natural world
although many people when they think
about the environment they talk about
let's save the environment let's protect
the environment
they're talking about the natural world
right
trees uh ponds lakes
waterfalls in this case let's don't
destroy it
don't change it let's preserve it let's
conserve it
okay so environment
close now there's be careful
be careful about this word because
there's two pronunciations two different
meanings right
in this case it's close that means
nearby next to not far from
but don't get confused because you could
also pronounce this word as
close which is a different meaning
completely different meaning
if the door is open right you close the
door
so it's the same spelling but different
pronunciations
close or close in this case we're
talking about
close it's close by it's
nearby it's next to not
far from so hopefully your school
is close to your house maybe you can
walk
to your school you don't have to take a
long bus ride
if so then the school is close to your
home
right your parents room is close
to your room right you just walk a few
steps and you can get to one or the
other
so close not close okay
here okay next needle
be careful with needles they're very
sharp
right a needle is what maybe your mom
uses
to sew close together or
if there's a rip you know sometimes
people want to conserve their clothing
or
save their clothing they don't want to
throw it away so they might
sew up that rip in your jeans or your
shirt
or whatever and they use a needle
because a needle you can go
in and out through the through the
fabric
and you can use a a thread
with a needle and you can close a hole
so the thread the thread will go here
right right through there and this is an
interesting part of the needle by the
way
we call that the eye
the eye of a needle right a needle of
course is a
thin sharp be careful this
is sharp that's very sharp point that's
dangerous that is
sharp so be careful with needles
it can it can enter your skin and ouch
it hurts so be careful with needles it's
a thin
sharp object usually usually can be used
for other things but
usually used in sewing like i said
sewing
that's to repair your clothes so you put
the
thread this is the thread
you put the thread through the eye of
the needle and you use the sharp end
to poke through the cloth and you can
sew up a hole
in your clothing okay that's a needle
okay let's talk about plant adaptations
and we can see how
plants there are different plant
adaptations to habitats now we just went
over the vocabulary
but there's two more words i'd like to
introduce to you guys
and the first one is adapt
adapt means to change
but it means to change to
fit or to match
especially your surroundings right so
you adapt you can adapt to groups of
people too
you could adapt to the things that are
around you you fit in with them
so if you uh you know if you grow up you
change
according to how the things are
your environment or the people around
you you adapt
okay and you can adapt you know maybe if
you you go from playing with your
your brothers and sisters and then you
start school you have to adapt
to school you have to change according
to the school and the rules at the
school so you change
adapt needs to change the other word is
habitat what is
habitat that's kind of an interesting
word it's a little bit of a difficult
word but it's okay it's not that hard
habitat is like
remember the word we just learned
environment
okay habitat is where a thing lives
where does it live
right in this case we're talking about
plants and plant habitats
so habitat is like the environment in
which the plants grow up environment
notice how i pronounce
environment to for spelling
n m but don't pronounce it like that
it's environment environment
um so environment is that same as
habitat you know
we can talk about different types of
habitats
this is one type of habitat this is
another type of habitat these are three
types of habitats
areas natural areas that have certain
characteristics
okay so how do plants change according
to where they live
according to their environment according
to their habitat
now the first habitat is tundra
what is tundra when i hear the word
tundra i think
cold right because tundra means that the
ground
is frozen right it's very cold ground
but plants still live there
where do we find tundra we find tanja in
very if you go far north like very far
north in canada
or in russia above the arctic circle you
can find tundra
but you can also find tundra in very
tall mountains
right i used to live in colorado for a
couple of years when i was a kid
and you could go hiking in the rocky
mountains you get
so far you get so high that trees don't
grow there it's too cold for the trees
right we call that tundra right and just
uh
these types of plants live there what
kinds of plants
hairy plants wait hairy right we talked
about that before
how can plants be hairy but some plants
it looks like hair
these plants they're they're not trees
right like i said it's too cold for the
trees
but some types of plants that grow close
to each other because
it's warmer if they do that but they're
very close to each other and they might
have very thin
leaves that stick up and the leaves
aren't very strong so they might move
back and forth in the wind
and if you look at it on the tundra it
looks like hair
moving back and forth in the wind so it
looks like hairy plants
another example of hairy plants not in
tundra
but in a different habitat is the desert
because i also kind of spent some time i
was growing up in
arizona and in arizona there's a cactus
with needles and there's the cactus is
covered with these needles there are
lots of them and they're very close
together
and they're white and and it looks funny
uh people call it the teddy bear cactus
that's not the formal name but it's just
kind of a
common name for cactus the teddy bear
cactus because the needles are so many
it looks like hair of course very
dangerous don't
you know don't touch it because it'll
it'll it'll grab on to your skin
it might hurt but it's called teddy bear
teddy bear cholla teddy bear cactus
and so yeah sometimes plants can look
like they have hair
it's not really hair it just looks like
hair so we say oh it looks hairy right
looks like it has hair
okay so tundra is one type of habitat
prairie is another type of habitat what
is prairie
prairie you remember the word we learned
flat
right like i said kansas and nebraska
those states there's no mountains
there's no valleys
the land is just straight and flat and
if
you go there and you look especially in
the springtime you look at the ground
the uh the grass and the the flowers not
many trees
grow in the prairie prairie is open
right but it does have grass it has
little plants growing up
and as far as you can see it's green
green green green grass
and the spring sometimes yellow with
flowers blue
flowers very beautiful but as far as you
can see as
far as you can see it's flat and just
covered with this green grass that's
prairie prairie is very famous in the
american west
of course as settlers move from the east
to the west many american indian tribes
lived on the prairie the prairie indian
tribes
and also buffalo lived on the praise
imagine these
huge huge herds of buffalo
moving up and down these prairies eating
the grass and the indians
followed the buffalo and that's how they
got their food
and many of the things they needed for
their life that's prairie
okay so in the prairie plants with
narrow leaves grow
there the the narrow leaves uh
uh plants and also small plants you
don't see if it if it's full of trees
that's not prairie it's
forest right and another word for forest
is
woodland woodland so woodland of course
can be
on flat land it can be in mountains it
can be in valleys just an
area covered with trees we call it
woodland now in a woodland
you notice two different types of trees
look at the
leaves on the picture on the left under
woodland you see these these leaves here
they are wide flat leaves
canada is famous for they for their
maple tree right where they
they get syrup and maple leaf is on
their flag and that's the type of leaf
that we're talking about
canada is covered with woodlands there's
many woodlands many forests in canada
and they have these types of trees that
have wide flat leaves they catch the
rain as they fall as the rain falls
it also catches sunlight but notice
these leaves are not green
they are yellow and some of them are red
what's going on well in the fall
these leaves well they're green most of
the year right in the springtime they
grow new leaves they're green
summertime they're green but in the fall
they turn
different colors they're very beautiful
right in the fall many people go to the
forest to the woodlands to look at the
trees
the changing of the leaves but the
leaves are dying
and as they die they turn color and they
fall to the ground
the tree doesn't die right the tree
remains alive right
but in the winter time the tree looks
dead it looks like a stick you know with
these sticks sticking off it
it's not very pretty right but in the
spring new leaves will grow
and that cycle will repeat so that's one
type of tree
on the right side you see a different
type of tree
and you see these little needles on
instead of leaves they don't have leaves
they have needles
now this type of tree it we call it a
special name we call that tree an
evergreen ever green
and that's an interesting word it's easy
to remember ever
because it's always ever always it's
always green
spring summer fall winter doesn't matter
it's always green
pine trees are very common or
typical evergreens and we find those
usually in the mountains
so plants with narrow needle shaped
leaves
those are usually evergreens
good word okay next
how are some plants adapted or how do
some plants adapt to their environment
well like i said before in the desert
which is another type of habitat i
already put that up there
desert uh here we see
the word saguaro saguaro not
not saguaro okay again i
i grew up in arizona and we had these
cactus
in our backyard in our home when i was
growing up when i was in uh
um last of elementary school and during
middle school
i lived in arizona we moved around a lot
so that was middle school
and end of uh elementary school we had
we had a home in
tucson arizona and we had these big
cactus imagine looking out your back
door of your home
and seeing these big cactus in your
backyard that's what it was like in
arizona
they grow all over the place but they're
very tall they're
really tall they're taller than three
people three
grown men on top of each other that's
how tall they can get
and they're very heavy because a lot of
it is water
but they protect that water how do they
protect that water
because they have the needles right we
talked about the needles so on the
evergreens the needles
they're not too sharp you don't have to
worry about it they look like needles
but the needles on a cactus yes be
careful because they can prick you
they can go into your skin so you got to
be careful don't
don't run into a if you run into and
bump into a swarov
ow you're going to be in pain for weeks
afterwards thankfully i never did that
nobody i knew ever did that but you got
to be careful okay so
anyway saguaro's these big cactus they
have a lot of water in them so they're
very heavy
but they protect that water they don't
want animals coming and drinking the
water eating them
to get the water so they protect
themselves with
needles okay that's saguaro
okay goldenrod plant that's a uh
a type of plant usually not in the
desert more maybe more prairie or
maybe in woodlands goldenrod plants it's
stiff stems
and leaves help the plant keep the water
it needs to live
so the golden rod has stiff stiff means
it's strong
the stem is of course the main part of
the plant and it's stiff it doesn't bend
easily in the wind it's stiff it's
strong
it and the leaves it also has stiff
leaves
they help the plant keep the water save
the water
inside of it because the plant needs
that water the water it needs to live
over here we have stinging nettle sting
ah that doesn't sound very nice does it
sting
means you know like i said on the um the
cactus needles if they poke you it's
like
stinging right but normally when we
think of sting we think of a b
like the b has a needle on its bottom
right
and it can sting you or a scorpion you
can find scorpions
where you find swirl cactuses you find
scorpions or the insect with the tail
and it has a stinger on the end so it
can sting you
a stinging nettle is a plant that can
sting you right
it has tiny sharp hairs again not like
hair like mammals but
you know like a needle like like a
cactus but it's not a cactus but the
they have very small thorns or needles
on the stem protect the plant from
animals and in fact
if you talk about short
needles on the stem of a plant those
are usually what we call thorns
and of course roses are famous for
having
thorns so it's not really hair it's more
like a thorn
and they can stick you and you don't
want to get it on your skin it's not
it's not as long or as dangerous as a
cactus needle
but they can prick your skin and then
there's not comfortable so
those are nettles we call them nettles
thin sharp hairs on the stem
to protect the plant from animals so
plants change
in many ways depending on the
environment that they are
in does it have a lot of water in the
environment not a lot of water
does it have animals that are going to
try to eat it for its water or not
how do they change according to their
environment
okay well we're going to read a passage
next
about these different types of plants
and how they adapt okay that'll be next
okay let's get into the reading for
plant adaptations
as i read read along with me you can
read out loud or in your head
practice the pronunciation here we go
plants have adapted to live in their
habitats
tundras are cold and windy
habitats you see the picture of the
tundra here looks like it's way up north
maybe in alaska or very far
north in canada okay anyway
those are tundras most
tundra plants are hairy this
adaptation helps keep the plants
warm the plants grow close
to each other and to the ground and that
protects them from the wind
right so in a very cold area plants will
be very close together
and they're warm so they keep help keep
each other warm they don't grow tall
you don't find many trees in the tundra
they're low plants
okay a prairie
is a flat habitat with a lot of grass
it is hot and dry in summer
prairie plants have narrow leaves
this helps the plant keep
water leaves
lose water but wide leaves
lose water faster than narrow leaves
woodland trees have adapted to the
environment
in winter water can freeze
and plants cannot use it
okay if the water's ice the plants can't
take it
into their bodies
maple trees have wide flat
leaves the leaves drop off
in fall this helps the maple
to conserve water conserve
keep water right pine trees
have narrow needle shaped leaves
they do not drop off and they lose
little water aha
so that's why some trees with the wide
leaves
the leaves drop they don't need them in
the winter because they can't get the
water it's too cold
the water is frozen but pine trees don't
care
okay their leaves are small they don't
lose a lot of water
so they can keep them all year round
okay let's get into the reading skill
now in this case we're talking about the
main idea
and the details the main idea is that
plants
adapt to different habitats
plants have adapted to live in their
habitats
right now the details we can see
different habitats
and what are those changes what are
those
adaptations adaptations changes
okay so the first we talk about tundra
plants
tundra plants are beep and grow close to
each other now we talked about tundra
plants
tundra plants need to have leaves that
are
wide broad are they tall plants no
they're short plants
and their leaves look like what they
look like hair
so tundra plants are hairy
they are hairy oops harry there we go
hairy and grow close to each other why
because it's warmer that way okay good
that's tundra prairie plants
prairie plants have peep leaves to help
keep water now we didn't really go over
this in the vocabulary but
it was in the reading it's you know if
we have wide
right some plants like maple trees have
wide leaves
but prairie plants don't have wide
leaves what is the opposite of
wide in the reading we saw the word
narrow so prairie plants have
narrow leaves nero
nero is the opposite of wide prairie
plants have
narrow leaves because it keeps the water
right
big leaves there's a lot of water can
evaporate
from the leaves if it's very sunny and
very dry and as we saw
in the summertime on the prairie it's
hot and dry not a lot of water
so plants need to keep their water they
have narrow leaves
okay good now next we have maple trees
and we're talking about
woodlands of course in woodlands and
where we see maple trees
maple trees beep water when
leaves drop off in the fall so i just
talked about
prairie plants having narrow leaves
because they want to
save water they want to keep their water
maple leaves have big
wide leaves so they lose water right
when uh
when the sun's out when it's hot and dry
but in the winter they can't use
water right the leaves can't take in
water so they don't really need their
leaves anyway so
if they can't take in the water but
they're losing water
right they're not saving their water so
what do maple trees do
they conserve water they keep their
water they save their water
when leaves drop off in the fall and
conserve is our vocabulary word
conserve and that is why
maple trees elm trees oak trees
the wide leaf trees lose the leaves in
the fall
it's very beautiful in the fall so maple
trees conserve
water when leaves drop off in the fall
turn color
and drop off now pine trees don't worry
about that
they're not worried because they don't
have wide leaves pine trees
have narrow leaves so they beep
little water so what is the opposite of
conserve
they don't have to worry about
conserving water because they don't
lose water they lose little water they
lose
little not a lot they lose a little bit
not a big deal
we don't have to worry right our leaves
are very small they're like needles
they're not wide
we don't lose a lot of water we lose
little water
lose little water is the opposite of
lose a lot of water
so pine trees don't worry they have the
leaves the green leaves
all year round so they are called
evergreens they are always green
evergreen trees okay so in this
unit we talked about different types of
plants we talked about you know
grasses we talked about trees different
types of trees and we talked about
how they change and how they are
different how they adapt
to their environments their habitats so
plant adaptations how do plants
change according to their environments
how do plants adapt to their habitats
okay so as an interesting lesson we
learned a lot about different types of
plants and ways plants change
according to the environment which is
basically part of the natural world
everything you see in nature is adapted
or has adapted over a
very long time to suit itself to
match itself to the environment in which
it lives okay interesting lesson i hope
you learned a lot with me
we'll see you next time take care
everybody bye bye

hello everybody how are you today
00:12
welcome back to american textbook
00:14
reading
00:15
i'm brian stewart today we're studying
00:17
from science book
00:19
number three and we're on lesson five
00:22
plant adaptations so we're taking a look
00:26
at how plants have
00:27
changed over time and over
00:30
different environments so you will
00:32
discover how plants
00:34
change and the types of environments
00:39
in which plants live there are many
00:41
different environments we'll talk about
00:43
those in
00:44
the unit today so as usual let's begin
00:47
with the vocabulary
00:49
what are the words that we can use to
00:51
help us talk about these things
00:54
first we can see harry
00:58
hairy plants can plants be hairy
01:01
normally when we think about hair right
01:04
we think about the hair
01:05
on our heads or the hair on an animal
01:09
like a dog
01:10
or a horse right but hairy plants
01:14
yes it's possible that some plants seem
01:16
to have
01:17
hair we'll see that okay so hairy means
01:20
having a lot of
01:21
hair but plants of course don't have
01:24
hair
01:25
but it may look like they have hair so
01:28
we'll see that in a little while so
01:30
hairy flat
01:34
flat is you could say maybe
01:37
some people probably say boring
01:39
countryside sorry
01:41
if you live in a flat area but flat just
01:43
means
01:44
that the land is flat
01:47
there's no change it doesn't go down it
01:50
doesn't go up
01:50
there are no mountains no valleys it's
01:52
just flat
01:54
a flat land having no high or curved
01:57
parts
01:58
or curved i guess would be curved in the
02:00
land like this
02:01
no it's all flat so if you live in an
02:03
area like
02:04
farmland many people live in farmland
02:07
where the farms need to be flat
02:09
so it's easy for the farmer to grow
02:11
plants there
02:12
many states in america are famous for
02:15
being flat
02:16
like kansas nebraska
02:20
now people in kansas and nebraska might
02:22
get mad at me but i'm sorry
02:24
but you know i i grew up in
02:27
mostly western states there are many
02:28
mountains there it's not flat you know
02:30
you have huge mountains
02:32
so um injured but there are many parts
02:34
of the area country
02:36
that are flat and that's just what it
02:37
means no mountains no valleys flat
02:41
lose lose i hope you don't experience
02:44
this but
02:45
it's part of life usually we lose
02:47
something you can't avoid it
02:49
lose means you do not have something any
02:52
longer
02:53
right if you have something in your hand
02:55
like
02:56
coins or your favorite toy uh
02:59
and it drops out of your hand maybe
03:02
you're not paying attention
03:04
you you lose it somewhere like oh no
03:06
where did it go
03:07
i can't find it i lost it right that
03:11
means
03:11
it uh to lose means that you have
03:15
lost the thing that you had before
03:18
it also happens in the environment in
03:20
this picture lose what does this picture
03:22
have to do with
03:23
lose well maybe they're talking about
03:25
water over time
03:26
the land has lost the water so that
03:29
could be
03:30
an idea for this picture okay
03:34
freeze in the winter time
03:37
we know this word very well that's when
03:40
it becomes
03:40
so cold that water changes
03:44
from a liquid to a solid
03:48
it becomes hard and solid because the
03:51
temperature
03:52
goes below zero degrees celsius
03:55
that is the temperature at which water
03:59
turns from liquid to ice right
04:02
and ice is a hard cold substance right
04:06
it's solid
04:07
right so to freeze that's basically what
04:10
it means to freeze of course it's very
04:11
cold
04:12
to do that of course in your home you
04:14
can find an example of freezing
04:16
just go to your refrigerator and open
04:19
the freezer side
04:21
of your refrigerator not the
04:22
refrigerator side that's just cold
04:24
open the freezer part where it's really
04:27
cold and you keep
04:28
ice and your mom keeps the food that's
04:30
frozen
04:31
for later okay good
04:35
here we have a video uh or yeah a video
04:38
of something freezing well actually
04:40
i could say this is melting really this
04:42
is the opposite of freezing
04:44
but it's hard to show a video of
04:46
freezing because you know it's
04:48
you have to sit there and watch it and
04:49
you may not notice the change
04:51
very quickly but here we have a picture
04:54
of many what do we call these things
04:56
by the way when water drips down and
04:58
it's so cold that it
05:00
it freezes as it's dripping down that's
05:02
an
05:03
interesting word we call these things
05:05
here we call them
05:06
ice cold and there's more than one so we
05:10
say
05:10
i circled two so icicles is the plural
05:14
but ice ice icicles like ice
05:18
and ickle not a popsicle popsicles those
05:21
are delicious
05:21
but popsicles are frozen fruit uh
05:25
drink right uh instead of drinking the
05:27
fruit juice you
05:28
freeze it and it becomes a popsicle
05:35
ah you see the similar similarity in the
05:38
words popsicle is
05:40
frozen fruit drink so if you have a
05:42
grape popsicle
05:43
or a watermelon popsicle right that's
05:46
frozen watermelon juice
05:47
and it's nice to eat on a hot summer day
05:50
but
05:51
that's that liquid has frozen
05:54
into these shapes in this case icicle
05:57
okay our next word is conserve
06:00
very important word conserve means to
06:03
save
06:04
right to keep and protect from loss
06:08
or waste same as i said to
06:11
save save it don't
06:14
waste it waste is the opposite of
06:17
conserve
06:18
you don't want to waste clean water
06:22
unfortunately clean water is rare
06:26
in some parts of the world some people
06:28
have a hard time
06:29
getting clean water that they can drink
06:33
and we don't want to waste
06:35
our resources we want to conserve them
06:37
we want to keep them
06:38
just use them when you need them don't
06:40
just waste them because
06:42
one day they may not be available so
06:46
easily
06:46
and it may be difficult to get them so
06:49
we should conserve
06:50
and we should keep and protect the
06:53
things that are valuable
06:54
to us so conserve save or to keep
06:59
okay environment of course we should
07:02
protect the environment
07:03
people can say conserve the environment
07:06
save the environment
07:07
keep the environment clean so
07:11
the environment is the natural world
07:13
it's the world that's around you
07:14
although yeah that's what
07:17
many people normally the traditional old
07:20
thinking of the environment is the
07:22
natural world
07:23
but environment can also mean uh an
07:26
industrial or city
07:27
that's also an environment you can say
07:29
urban environment
07:31
that would be a city environment so
07:32
environment isn't just the natural world
07:35
although many people when they think
07:36
about the environment they talk about
07:38
let's save the environment let's protect
07:41
the environment
07:42
they're talking about the natural world
07:45
right
07:46
trees uh ponds lakes
07:50
waterfalls in this case let's don't
07:53
destroy it
07:54
don't change it let's preserve it let's
07:56
conserve it
07:58
okay so environment
08:01
close now there's be careful
08:04
be careful about this word because
08:05
there's two pronunciations two different
08:07
meanings right
08:08
in this case it's close that means
08:11
nearby next to not far from
08:14
but don't get confused because you could
08:17
also pronounce this word as
08:18
close which is a different meaning
08:21
completely different meaning
08:22
if the door is open right you close the
08:25
door
08:26
so it's the same spelling but different
08:29
pronunciations
08:30
close or close in this case we're
08:33
talking about
08:34
close it's close by it's
08:37
nearby it's next to not
08:41
far from so hopefully your school
08:44
is close to your house maybe you can
08:47
walk
08:47
to your school you don't have to take a
08:49
long bus ride
08:51
if so then the school is close to your
08:54
home
08:55
right your parents room is close
08:58
to your room right you just walk a few
09:01
steps and you can get to one or the
09:03
other
09:03
so close not close okay
09:07
here okay next needle
09:11
be careful with needles they're very
09:14
sharp
09:15
right a needle is what maybe your mom
09:17
uses
09:18
to sew close together or
09:22
if there's a rip you know sometimes
09:23
people want to conserve their clothing
09:26
or
09:26
save their clothing they don't want to
09:28
throw it away so they might
09:30
sew up that rip in your jeans or your
09:33
shirt
09:34
or whatever and they use a needle
09:36
because a needle you can go
09:38
in and out through the through the
09:40
fabric
09:41
and you can use a a thread
09:44
with a needle and you can close a hole
09:47
so the thread the thread will go here
09:51
right right through there and this is an
09:53
interesting part of the needle by the
09:55
way
09:55
we call that the eye
09:59
the eye of a needle right a needle of
10:03
course is a
10:03
thin sharp be careful this
10:07
is sharp that's very sharp point that's
10:09
dangerous that is
10:11
sharp so be careful with needles
10:14
it can it can enter your skin and ouch
10:17
it hurts so be careful with needles it's
10:20
a thin
10:21
sharp object usually usually can be used
10:24
for other things but
10:25
usually used in sewing like i said
10:28
sewing
10:28
that's to repair your clothes so you put
10:31
the
10:31
thread this is the thread
10:35
you put the thread through the eye of
10:38
the needle and you use the sharp end
10:40
to poke through the cloth and you can
10:43
sew up a hole
10:44
in your clothing okay that's a needle
10:48
okay let's talk about plant adaptations
10:50
and we can see how
10:52
plants there are different plant
10:54
adaptations to habitats now we just went
10:57
over the vocabulary
10:58
but there's two more words i'd like to
11:00
introduce to you guys
11:02
and the first one is adapt
11:05
adapt means to change
11:08
but it means to change to
11:12
fit or to match
11:15
especially your surroundings right so
11:17
you adapt you can adapt to groups of
11:19
people too
11:20
you could adapt to the things that are
11:22
around you you fit in with them
11:24
so if you uh you know if you grow up you
11:27
change
11:28
according to how the things are
11:31
your environment or the people around
11:33
you you adapt
11:35
okay and you can adapt you know maybe if
11:37
you you go from playing with your
11:39
your brothers and sisters and then you
11:40
start school you have to adapt
11:42
to school you have to change according
11:44
to the school and the rules at the
11:46
school so you change
11:47
adapt needs to change the other word is
11:49
habitat what is
11:50
habitat that's kind of an interesting
11:52
word it's a little bit of a difficult
11:53
word but it's okay it's not that hard
11:55
habitat is like
11:56
remember the word we just learned
11:58
environment
12:00
okay habitat is where a thing lives
12:03
where does it live
12:05
right in this case we're talking about
12:06
plants and plant habitats
12:09
so habitat is like the environment in
12:11
which the plants grow up environment
12:15
notice how i pronounce
12:16
environment to for spelling
12:19
n m but don't pronounce it like that
12:22
it's environment environment
12:25
um so environment is that same as
12:27
habitat you know
12:29
we can talk about different types of
12:31
habitats
12:32
this is one type of habitat this is
12:34
another type of habitat these are three
12:36
types of habitats
12:38
areas natural areas that have certain
12:40
characteristics
12:41
okay so how do plants change according
12:45
to where they live
12:46
according to their environment according
12:48
to their habitat
12:50
now the first habitat is tundra
12:53
what is tundra when i hear the word
12:55
tundra i think
12:56
cold right because tundra means that the
12:59
ground
13:00
is frozen right it's very cold ground
13:03
but plants still live there
13:04
where do we find tundra we find tanja in
13:08
very if you go far north like very far
13:10
north in canada
13:12
or in russia above the arctic circle you
13:14
can find tundra
13:15
but you can also find tundra in very
13:19
tall mountains
13:20
right i used to live in colorado for a
13:22
couple of years when i was a kid
13:24
and you could go hiking in the rocky
13:25
mountains you get
13:27
so far you get so high that trees don't
13:29
grow there it's too cold for the trees
13:32
right we call that tundra right and just
13:35
uh
13:35
these types of plants live there what
13:37
kinds of plants
13:39
hairy plants wait hairy right we talked
13:42
about that before
13:43
how can plants be hairy but some plants
13:46
it looks like hair
13:48
these plants they're they're not trees
13:51
right like i said it's too cold for the
13:53
trees
13:53
but some types of plants that grow close
13:56
to each other because
13:57
it's warmer if they do that but they're
13:59
very close to each other and they might
14:01
have very thin
14:02
leaves that stick up and the leaves
14:04
aren't very strong so they might move
14:05
back and forth in the wind
14:07
and if you look at it on the tundra it
14:09
looks like hair
14:10
moving back and forth in the wind so it
14:13
looks like hairy plants
14:15
another example of hairy plants not in
14:17
tundra
14:18
but in a different habitat is the desert
14:21
because i also kind of spent some time i
14:24
was growing up in
14:24
arizona and in arizona there's a cactus
14:28
with needles and there's the cactus is
14:31
covered with these needles there are
14:33
lots of them and they're very close
14:34
together
14:35
and they're white and and it looks funny
14:38
uh people call it the teddy bear cactus
14:41
that's not the formal name but it's just
14:43
kind of a
14:44
common name for cactus the teddy bear
14:46
cactus because the needles are so many
14:49
it looks like hair of course very
14:51
dangerous don't
14:52
you know don't touch it because it'll
14:54
it'll it'll grab on to your skin
14:56
it might hurt but it's called teddy bear
14:58
teddy bear cholla teddy bear cactus
15:01
and so yeah sometimes plants can look
15:04
like they have hair
15:05
it's not really hair it just looks like
15:08
hair so we say oh it looks hairy right
15:11
looks like it has hair
15:12
okay so tundra is one type of habitat
15:16
prairie is another type of habitat what
15:19
is prairie
15:20
prairie you remember the word we learned
15:22
flat
15:23
right like i said kansas and nebraska
15:25
those states there's no mountains
15:26
there's no valleys
15:28
the land is just straight and flat and
15:31
if
15:31
you go there and you look especially in
15:33
the springtime you look at the ground
15:36
the uh the grass and the the flowers not
15:39
many trees
15:40
grow in the prairie prairie is open
15:43
right but it does have grass it has
15:44
little plants growing up
15:46
and as far as you can see it's green
15:48
green green green grass
15:51
and the spring sometimes yellow with
15:52
flowers blue
15:54
flowers very beautiful but as far as you
15:56
can see as
15:57
far as you can see it's flat and just
16:00
covered with this green grass that's
16:02
prairie prairie is very famous in the
16:04
american west
16:05
of course as settlers move from the east
16:07
to the west many american indian tribes
16:10
lived on the prairie the prairie indian
16:12
tribes
16:12
and also buffalo lived on the praise
16:15
imagine these
16:16
huge huge herds of buffalo
16:19
moving up and down these prairies eating
16:22
the grass and the indians
16:23
followed the buffalo and that's how they
16:26
got their food
16:26
and many of the things they needed for
16:28
their life that's prairie
16:30
okay so in the prairie plants with
16:33
narrow leaves grow
16:34
there the the narrow leaves uh
16:37
uh plants and also small plants you
16:39
don't see if it if it's full of trees
16:41
that's not prairie it's
16:43
forest right and another word for forest
16:45
is
16:46
woodland woodland so woodland of course
16:49
can be
16:50
on flat land it can be in mountains it
16:52
can be in valleys just an
16:54
area covered with trees we call it
16:56
woodland now in a woodland
16:58
you notice two different types of trees
17:01
look at the
17:01
leaves on the picture on the left under
17:04
woodland you see these these leaves here
17:07
they are wide flat leaves
17:10
canada is famous for they for their
17:13
maple tree right where they
17:14
they get syrup and maple leaf is on
17:17
their flag and that's the type of leaf
17:19
that we're talking about
17:20
canada is covered with woodlands there's
17:23
many woodlands many forests in canada
17:25
and they have these types of trees that
17:28
have wide flat leaves they catch the
17:30
rain as they fall as the rain falls
17:32
it also catches sunlight but notice
17:34
these leaves are not green
17:37
they are yellow and some of them are red
17:40
what's going on well in the fall
17:44
these leaves well they're green most of
17:46
the year right in the springtime they
17:48
grow new leaves they're green
17:49
summertime they're green but in the fall
17:52
they turn
17:53
different colors they're very beautiful
17:54
right in the fall many people go to the
17:57
forest to the woodlands to look at the
17:58
trees
17:59
the changing of the leaves but the
18:02
leaves are dying
18:03
and as they die they turn color and they
18:05
fall to the ground
18:06
the tree doesn't die right the tree
18:08
remains alive right
18:10
but in the winter time the tree looks
18:12
dead it looks like a stick you know with
18:14
these sticks sticking off it
18:15
it's not very pretty right but in the
18:18
spring new leaves will grow
18:19
and that cycle will repeat so that's one
18:22
type of tree
18:23
on the right side you see a different
18:26
type of tree
18:27
and you see these little needles on
18:30
instead of leaves they don't have leaves
18:31
they have needles
18:32
now this type of tree it we call it a
18:35
special name we call that tree an
18:36
evergreen ever green
18:40
and that's an interesting word it's easy
18:42
to remember ever
18:43
because it's always ever always it's
18:46
always green
18:48
spring summer fall winter doesn't matter
18:51
it's always green
18:53
pine trees are very common or
18:56
typical evergreens and we find those
18:58
usually in the mountains
19:00
so plants with narrow needle shaped
19:02
leaves
19:03
those are usually evergreens
19:06
good word okay next
19:09
how are some plants adapted or how do
19:12
some plants adapt to their environment
19:15
well like i said before in the desert
19:17
which is another type of habitat i
19:19
already put that up there
19:20
desert uh here we see
19:24
the word saguaro saguaro not
19:27
not saguaro okay again i
19:30
i grew up in arizona and we had these
19:33
cactus
19:34
in our backyard in our home when i was
19:36
growing up when i was in uh
19:38
um last of elementary school and during
19:41
middle school
19:42
i lived in arizona we moved around a lot
19:44
so that was middle school
19:45
and end of uh elementary school we had
19:48
we had a home in
19:49
tucson arizona and we had these big
19:52
cactus imagine looking out your back
19:54
door of your home
19:55
and seeing these big cactus in your
19:57
backyard that's what it was like in
19:59
arizona
19:59
they grow all over the place but they're
20:01
very tall they're
20:03
really tall they're taller than three
20:04
people three
20:06
grown men on top of each other that's
20:08
how tall they can get
20:10
and they're very heavy because a lot of
20:12
it is water
20:13
but they protect that water how do they
20:16
protect that water
20:17
because they have the needles right we
20:20
talked about the needles so on the
20:21
evergreens the needles
20:22
they're not too sharp you don't have to
20:24
worry about it they look like needles
20:26
but the needles on a cactus yes be
20:28
careful because they can prick you
20:30
they can go into your skin so you got to
20:31
be careful don't
20:33
don't run into a if you run into and
20:35
bump into a swarov
20:38
ow you're going to be in pain for weeks
20:41
afterwards thankfully i never did that
20:42
nobody i knew ever did that but you got
20:45
to be careful okay so
20:46
anyway saguaro's these big cactus they
20:48
have a lot of water in them so they're
20:50
very heavy
20:51
but they protect that water they don't
20:53
want animals coming and drinking the
20:54
water eating them
20:56
to get the water so they protect
20:58
themselves with
20:59
needles okay that's saguaro
21:02
okay goldenrod plant that's a uh
21:05
a type of plant usually not in the
21:07
desert more maybe more prairie or
21:10
maybe in woodlands goldenrod plants it's
21:13
stiff stems
21:14
and leaves help the plant keep the water
21:17
it needs to live
21:18
so the golden rod has stiff stiff means
21:21
it's strong
21:22
the stem is of course the main part of
21:24
the plant and it's stiff it doesn't bend
21:27
easily in the wind it's stiff it's
21:29
strong
21:30
it and the leaves it also has stiff
21:33
leaves
21:34
they help the plant keep the water save
21:37
the water
21:37
inside of it because the plant needs
21:40
that water the water it needs to live
21:43
over here we have stinging nettle sting
21:46
ah that doesn't sound very nice does it
21:48
sting
21:49
means you know like i said on the um the
21:52
cactus needles if they poke you it's
21:54
like
21:54
stinging right but normally when we
21:57
think of sting we think of a b
21:59
like the b has a needle on its bottom
22:02
right
22:02
and it can sting you or a scorpion you
22:04
can find scorpions
22:06
where you find swirl cactuses you find
22:08
scorpions or the insect with the tail
22:10
and it has a stinger on the end so it
22:13
can sting you
22:14
a stinging nettle is a plant that can
22:16
sting you right
22:17
it has tiny sharp hairs again not like
22:20
hair like mammals but
22:22
you know like a needle like like a
22:24
cactus but it's not a cactus but the
22:27
they have very small thorns or needles
22:30
on the stem protect the plant from
22:33
animals and in fact
22:34
if you talk about short
22:39
needles on the stem of a plant those
22:42
are usually what we call thorns
22:46
and of course roses are famous for
22:49
having
22:50
thorns so it's not really hair it's more
22:52
like a thorn
22:53
and they can stick you and you don't
22:55
want to get it on your skin it's not
22:57
it's not as long or as dangerous as a
23:00
cactus needle
23:01
but they can prick your skin and then
23:03
there's not comfortable so
23:05
those are nettles we call them nettles
23:07
thin sharp hairs on the stem
23:09
to protect the plant from animals so
23:11
plants change
23:12
in many ways depending on the
23:14
environment that they are
23:16
in does it have a lot of water in the
23:18
environment not a lot of water
23:20
does it have animals that are going to
23:22
try to eat it for its water or not
23:24
how do they change according to their
23:26
environment
23:27
okay well we're going to read a passage
23:29
next
23:30
about these different types of plants
23:32
and how they adapt okay that'll be next
23:39
okay let's get into the reading for
23:42
plant adaptations
23:45
as i read read along with me you can
23:47
read out loud or in your head
23:49
practice the pronunciation here we go
23:54
plants have adapted to live in their
23:57
habitats
23:58
tundras are cold and windy
24:02
habitats you see the picture of the
24:05
tundra here looks like it's way up north
24:07
maybe in alaska or very far
24:09
north in canada okay anyway
24:12
those are tundras most
24:15
tundra plants are hairy this
24:19
adaptation helps keep the plants
24:23
warm the plants grow close
24:27
to each other and to the ground and that
24:30
protects them from the wind
24:34
right so in a very cold area plants will
24:36
be very close together
24:38
and they're warm so they keep help keep
24:40
each other warm they don't grow tall
24:42
you don't find many trees in the tundra
24:44
they're low plants
24:46
okay a prairie
24:49
is a flat habitat with a lot of grass
24:54
it is hot and dry in summer
24:58
prairie plants have narrow leaves
25:02
this helps the plant keep
25:05
water leaves
25:09
lose water but wide leaves
25:13
lose water faster than narrow leaves
25:18
woodland trees have adapted to the
25:21
environment
25:23
in winter water can freeze
25:26
and plants cannot use it
25:30
okay if the water's ice the plants can't
25:33
take it
25:34
into their bodies
25:37
maple trees have wide flat
25:41
leaves the leaves drop off
25:44
in fall this helps the maple
25:47
to conserve water conserve
25:51
keep water right pine trees
25:55
have narrow needle shaped leaves
25:58
they do not drop off and they lose
26:02
little water aha
26:05
so that's why some trees with the wide
26:08
leaves
26:09
the leaves drop they don't need them in
26:10
the winter because they can't get the
26:12
water it's too cold
26:14
the water is frozen but pine trees don't
26:16
care
26:17
okay their leaves are small they don't
26:20
lose a lot of water
26:21
so they can keep them all year round
26:25
okay let's get into the reading skill
26:28
now in this case we're talking about the
26:29
main idea
26:30
and the details the main idea is that
26:33
plants
26:34
adapt to different habitats
26:37
plants have adapted to live in their
26:39
habitats
26:40
right now the details we can see
26:43
different habitats
26:44
and what are those changes what are
26:47
those
26:48
adaptations adaptations changes
26:51
okay so the first we talk about tundra
26:54
plants
26:56
tundra plants are beep and grow close to
26:59
each other now we talked about tundra
27:00
plants
27:01
tundra plants need to have leaves that
27:04
are
27:05
wide broad are they tall plants no
27:07
they're short plants
27:09
and their leaves look like what they
27:12
look like hair
27:13
so tundra plants are hairy
27:17
they are hairy oops harry there we go
27:21
hairy and grow close to each other why
27:25
because it's warmer that way okay good
27:28
that's tundra prairie plants
27:31
prairie plants have peep leaves to help
27:35
keep water now we didn't really go over
27:37
this in the vocabulary but
27:38
it was in the reading it's you know if
27:41
we have wide
27:42
right some plants like maple trees have
27:45
wide leaves
27:46
but prairie plants don't have wide
27:48
leaves what is the opposite of
27:50
wide in the reading we saw the word
27:53
narrow so prairie plants have
27:56
narrow leaves nero
28:00
nero is the opposite of wide prairie
28:03
plants have
28:04
narrow leaves because it keeps the water
28:06
right
28:07
big leaves there's a lot of water can
28:09
evaporate
28:10
from the leaves if it's very sunny and
28:13
very dry and as we saw
28:14
in the summertime on the prairie it's
28:17
hot and dry not a lot of water
28:19
so plants need to keep their water they
28:21
have narrow leaves
28:23
okay good now next we have maple trees
28:26
and we're talking about
28:26
woodlands of course in woodlands and
28:29
where we see maple trees
28:31
maple trees beep water when
28:34
leaves drop off in the fall so i just
28:36
talked about
28:37
prairie plants having narrow leaves
28:40
because they want to
28:41
save water they want to keep their water
28:43
maple leaves have big
28:45
wide leaves so they lose water right
28:47
when uh
28:49
when the sun's out when it's hot and dry
28:51
but in the winter they can't use
28:53
water right the leaves can't take in
28:55
water so they don't really need their
28:56
leaves anyway so
28:58
if they can't take in the water but
29:00
they're losing water
29:01
right they're not saving their water so
29:04
what do maple trees do
29:05
they conserve water they keep their
29:08
water they save their water
29:10
when leaves drop off in the fall and
29:12
conserve is our vocabulary word
29:15
conserve and that is why
29:18
maple trees elm trees oak trees
29:22
the wide leaf trees lose the leaves in
29:25
the fall
29:26
it's very beautiful in the fall so maple
29:28
trees conserve
29:29
water when leaves drop off in the fall
29:32
turn color
29:33
and drop off now pine trees don't worry
29:36
about that
29:37
they're not worried because they don't
29:38
have wide leaves pine trees
29:40
have narrow leaves so they beep
29:43
little water so what is the opposite of
29:47
conserve
29:48
they don't have to worry about
29:49
conserving water because they don't
29:52
lose water they lose little water they
29:55
lose
29:56
little not a lot they lose a little bit
29:59
not a big deal
30:00
we don't have to worry right our leaves
30:02
are very small they're like needles
30:04
they're not wide
30:05
we don't lose a lot of water we lose
30:08
little water
30:09
lose little water is the opposite of
30:10
lose a lot of water
30:12
so pine trees don't worry they have the
30:14
leaves the green leaves
30:15
all year round so they are called
30:17
evergreens they are always green
30:21
evergreen trees okay so in this
30:24
unit we talked about different types of
30:26
plants we talked about you know
30:28
grasses we talked about trees different
30:30
types of trees and we talked about
30:32
how they change and how they are
30:34
different how they adapt
30:36
to their environments their habitats so
30:40
plant adaptations how do plants
30:43
change according to their environments
30:46
how do plants adapt to their habitats
30:50
okay so as an interesting lesson we
30:52
learned a lot about different types of
30:54
plants and ways plants change
30:57
according to the environment which is
30:59
basically part of the natural world
31:01
everything you see in nature is adapted
31:04
or has adapted over a
31:05
very long time to suit itself to
31:09
match itself to the environment in which
31:12
it lives okay interesting lesson i hope
31:15
you learned a lot with me
31:17
we'll see you next time take care
31:18
everybody bye bye
