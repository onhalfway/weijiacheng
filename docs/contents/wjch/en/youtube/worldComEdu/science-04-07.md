hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading my name is brian stewart
and in this lesson we're looking at
science book four
lesson seven and lesson seven is about
changes on earth so in this lesson you
will discover
how the earth's surface changes
and also how ice can change
rocks so let's begin
in the vocabulary section our first
item is actually two words it is a
phrasal verb soak into
what is a phrasal verb a verb
plus a preposition
so verb plus preposition is a phrasal
verb and english has a lot of phrasal
verbs
that correspond to a certain specific
idea in this case we have soak
into right you could just say soak but
into kind of gives it a more special
meaning it means
for a liquid to move into something
and make it wet so if it's raining
and the water soaks into your clothes
then you are thoroughly wet it's not
good it's miserable right so soak into
for a liquid to move into something and
make it completely wet
with that liquid okay
next we have another phrasal verb wow
this lesson has many
phrasal verbs here we have where
away so where is our verb
away is the preposition where
away where away means to cause something
to become
thinner smaller or weaker
over time so really everything wears
away right if you have an a toy for
example
and there's a new paint job on the toy
so
the paint is shiny and new at the
beginning but over time
as you leave your toy out in the sun or
maybe it gets
wet or as you play with it it rubs up
against the
walls of your room or the carpet or the
floor of your room
and over time you know the paint
wears away it becomes thinner it becomes
weaker and sometimes the paint will
wear away completely and then you can
see the metal
underneath the paint by the way most
phrasal verbs
in english preposition plus
i'm sorry verb plus preposition have
another
more formal word that corresponds to
them and i should mention
it for this word where away has a more
scientific word that we usually use it's
very common
and that is erode it's
one word erode and from a road
that's a verb we get the noun erosion
and that's exactly what we are talking
about
in this unit when we talk about wind
water other forces
acting on for example rocks and the
rocks over time they fall down they
become
smaller they become weaker or the rock
layer becomes thinner
we call that erosion that process is
called erosion
and we can say the rocks erode but it
means that they
wear away all similar ideas
okay good next we have
glacier now glacier is a noun right
glacier is a large body of ice
that moves slowly over land
did you know that about 10 000 years ago
before 10 000 years ago most of the
earth was covered with ice
there were huge glaciers
covering large surfaces
of the earth and of course this ice
moved very slowly of course if the ice
forms up high in the mountains
it will slowly move downwards
because of gravity obviously and as it
moves
it might carve it actually pushes rock
out of the way and so glaciers are very
important
nowadays it glaciers are becoming harder
and harder to find because the earth
is getting warmer year by year so there
are glaciers
for example in the alps in europe but
these glaciers are getting smaller
there are glaciers in the rocky
mountains in northern america
and also many in canada and of course if
you go to alaska
you can see glaciers next to the ocean
but these glaciers
are getting smaller and smaller every
year
as it gets warmer
next we have earthquake i hope you live
in an
area that does not have many earthquakes
but an earthquake this is the after
effect of an
earthquake an earthquake is the shaking
of the ground
caused by the earth's crust moving
the earth's crust now in the previous
lesson we talked about the three parts
of the earth right crust mantle and core
and we said that the continents on the
crust is moving very slowly
it's moving very slowly sure but it does
move
and what happens is when the earth's
crust moves
right it might hit another part of the
earth's crust
there's many cracks in the earth's crust
and sometimes the earth
the one crust will go down underneath
one or
it might go over another one or
sometimes they butt up
against each other and do this that's
how the himalayas
were formed between india and china
because two
parts of the earth's surface were moving
very slowly
but they're moving up against each other
and that's why the land is so high there
so anyway sometimes when the earth you
know whether it's moving
under or over sometimes it gets stuck
right because it's rock right it's not
smooth it doesn't smoothly go over each
other
but it will stick and for many years
that pressure's building up right
all this other rock is moving behind it
and it's just stuck because
you know some parts don't move together
very well and then all of a sudden that
pressure is so much
that something breaks and then that
causes a big shock wave
especially at that area and that shock
wave is called an
earthquake and that's why it causes a
lot of damage in certain areas
okay but that's an earthquake okay
volcano
is another interesting feature remember
again we talked about the crust the
mantle and the core
now in the crust of the earth is very
deep usually but in some parts
of the of the earth the crust is thin
and the mantle is relatively close to
the surface of the earth now remember we
talked about the mantle
it's very hot in the mantle and part of
the mantle is liquid rock
now that liquid rock is under a lot of
pressure and that pressure wants to be
relieved
so if it finds a way to come up through
the crust
of the earth's surface that will form a
volcano
and a volcano is basically a mountain
which
lava can come out of remember in the
previous lesson
i said lava is molten or melted rock
it's rock that is liquid it's very hot
and this
is a typical shape of a volcano
usually it has a flat top because inside
there's a crater
and there are many cracks that the lava
can come
up and you see the smoke because it's so
hot right
so that it creates smoke and when it
when it
erupts lava comes out
land form land form is a natural shape
on the earth's
surface so if you go to certain parts of
the world like the american west or
certain parts of deserts in china
you can see some very interesting
uh patterns in the rock look at this
this looks strange doesn't it
it looks like somebody you know the flat
earth somehow got tilted
how did it happen well remember when we
talked about
you know i gave you the example the two
parts of the crust hitting each other
and rising up
and forming the himalayas well that
pressure is enough
to make the flat rock turn up like that
and then when water or the rock erodes
or washes away
we can see the different layers of the
soil that
once were flat are now like this
and you can see that's very interesting
part of geology
the study of the earth and so you can
see that
in many places in the world especially
dry places
where the bushes and the trees and the
grass don't cover the ground or the dirt
you can see it very easily okay next we
have a landslide now landslides are
disasters right
this is when a large amount of rocks
fall
down a mountain or a slope
so again you know our earth is very big
there's a lot of pressures
on the crust of the earth and
as you know a mountain
which is made of rock or dirt over time
right
things wash away things erode things get
weaker so the support
that's holding rocks and dirt on a
mountain slot
on a mountain slope that support might
wear away and then all of a sudden those
rocks
or whatever it is will fall and that's a
landslide
it could be mud too if there's a lot of
rain
the the dirt becomes very wet
it has a lot of water in it it becomes
heavier if it's
on a slope of course it gets heavier it
might suddenly fall down
and if there's a village or town down
below that is a terrible
disaster sometimes we read about those
in the news
next we have erupt i mentioned that
earlier erupt
is like an explosion right there
eruption
oh erupt is the verb
eruption is the noun eruption so when a
volcano
erupts we call that an eruption
it's when the lava and the very hot
molten rocks and rocks of course are
also
forced out of a volcano because of all
that pressure in the mantle all that
heat
comes up to the surface and sometimes it
comes out
very violently with a lot of force
and that of course is an eruption we
have a video of that
check this video out this is a video of
a volcano
erupting look at how much power there is
let's take a look
so look it's it's kind of looks like
slow motion but
we don't really see the lava or the
rocks what we do see is a lot of
ash and a lot of smoke by the way that
can be very deadly
so if there is a volcano in the area you
have to worry about a lot of different
things
you don't want to be caught in that ash
because it's very hot it could burn your
lungs
also if you're caught in it there's not
enough oxygen to breathe so you could
you know you could die because you don't
get enough oxygen and of course it's
very hot there's hot rocks being thrown
out of it
there's a lot of lava coming out of it
it's a very dangerous
situation a very famous eruption in
history
was the eruption over pompeii an ancient
roman city and that eruption happened so
fast and the lava came down
so quickly that people died when they
were running away
from the volcano and many people just
died in their homes
they were just overcome by the fumes and
now it's a very famous
archaeological site but that's also so
volcanoes are
are very uh terrible disasters but they
have also been present
in human history for a long time okay
lava we've talked about lava several
times already
so here we have the word lava is hot
liquid
liquid rock it's rock that is a liquid
imagine that it has to be really really
hot
for rock to turn into a liquid
and you can see the liquid here it's red
and there's a lot of steam coming off it
because any moisture in the air that
touches that it turns into steam right
away
it's very hot and in fact you can see
lava flows
you can see lava flows that's what we
call them this is a lava flow
you can see lava flows sometimes in
hawaii it's kind of a tourist attraction
some people go to hawaii
because hawaii has many volcanoes and
the lava flows
go down to the ocean and they create a
lot of steam it's a very amazing sight
so a lava is a hot liquid that comes out
of a volcano okay those are our words
for the lesson
let's continue the first idea of this
lesson the first main idea
is that there are different changes on
the earth or
of the earth and there are slow changes
but there are also
rapid changes now remember the earth has
been around
for a very very very very
very long time okay i can't i can't put
enough varies
you can't even imagine four and a half
billion years
that is something that is
incomprehensible to most humans right
but so and it has changed over that time
but very slowly
however there are some times when the
earth changes very quickly
and we can see it so what are slow
changes on the earth
well wind and rain cause slow changes of
course
there's we've all experienced wind we've
all experienced rain
if you look around after a rain storm
everything seems pretty much the same
but a hundred years or a thousand years
or ten thousand years of wind and rain
on the same mountain will change that
mountain
it will wear away the rock and the rock
of the mountain will change
shape over thousands of years because of
erosion
we talked about that earlier now
glaciers are also very
slow causes of
change on the earth and of course a
glacier is a big body of ice and these
big bodies of ice they do move but they
move very slowly
and they can like i said they can change
the shape of the earth
below the great the glacier the weight
of that glacier can change
the shape it can also change the
material
under the glacier a lot of glaciers in
north america that moved from high spots
to low spots
they carried a lot of nutrients or rich
soil underneath them
and spread them out over the plains of
north america
and that's why there's very good farming
in
some states in northern america very
good soil
but that soil was carried there by
glaciers
okay so slow changes on earth what are
some rapid changes on earth we already
know we saw some in the vocabulary
first of all we have the earthquake
right when there's a sudden break in
that pressure
and the earth shakes the shock wave
makes the earth shake
that is an earthquake and that's very
rapid unfortunately
we can see that in in happen
over just a matter of minutes
a landslide is also something that can
happen in just a few
seconds right when a bunch of mud or
rocks
or dirt just suddenly loses support and
falls down the slope
of a hill or a mountain we call that a
landslide
and then of course the other example we
talked about when we were talking about
lava
is a volcano when a volcano erupts of
course we can see that
in real time we don't have to sit there
and watch it for a thousand years
we can't do that anyway but we can see a
volcano erupt
in just a few hours or maybe over days
but
when it does erupt it's just a few
seconds we can see it really
just a few minutes so there are slow
changes on earth
and there are rapid changes on earth
so when we look in detail at one of
those changes like for example glaciers
glaciers or ice how can ice change
rocks that's an interesting idea ice is
really just frozen water
water isn't as strong as a rock a rock
is heavier and stronger right
but ice can change rocks how well
remember water changes into ice when
it's cold
and then it melts when it's warm
so this contraction and expansion
especially if the water is in
cracks in the rock imagine that
expansion and contraction going on
so it's sometimes the water changes into
ice in cold weather so when the water
changes into ice
right ice expands and it's pushing the
rocks
apart right but then the ice later on in
the springtime
it gets warmer so the ice melts
and it drains away so after
you know the ice uh expanded it makes
the crack
bigger and it gets bigger and then the
water washes away maybe the water takes
some of the soil or rock with it
so the crack gets bigger and then rocks
with
large cracks as you know and this
happens over many years right
contraction
expansion contraction expansion so the
cracks are getting bigger
and then rocks with large cracks finally
they lose support uh holding each other
together and the rocks fall apart so
where you had one rock
now you have maybe two rocks or three
rocks or several different
smaller rocks of course this process
takes
many years it takes probably more years
than you are alive so we don't really
see
this we don't notice it but it does
happen over
long periods of time and rocks will
break apart
especially if the rocks are on a
mountainside and they break apart well
of course they're going to fall down
make a landslide so there are
these slow changes in the earth can also
cause
rapid changes in the earth's surface
okay let's move on to the reading
and as usual i'll read out loud repeat
after me
or repeat along in your mind and focus
on pronunciation
and also think about the vocabulary
of the words that we learned today let's
begin
earth's earth's that's a little hymduro
to pronounce right
earth so you stick your tongue out
between your
your teeth earth earth and then you
slowly
bring it back in to make the s sound
earth's
earth i'm sorry i'm doing it too too
much earth's
landforms are always changing
they usually change very very
slowly when continents
move against each other land
can be moved upwards this
is how mountains are made
weathering can change landforms
weathering is caused by rain and wind
rain soaks into rock
and the rock wears away the wind
also wears away rock
mountains can be worn down to become
hills
a glacier moves down a mountain very
slowly it wears away the mountain
[Music]
and takes rock with it glaciers
can make valleys by the way that's very
interesting i'm sorry to interrupt here
but you know i grew up partly
in the american west and when you go
hiking in the mountains
there are different types of valleys you
might have a v-shaped valley like this
and there's a stream running through the
valley right
and these are these are mountains right
however in other places you might be
hiking through
a valley and you look up and you see
that there is a u-shaped
valley now if you see a and then maybe
there's a little waterfall here because
this is still high land right here's the
valley floor
if you see a u-shaped valley like this
that means it was formed by a glacier
because the ice is very thick
and wide and moving through the mountain
if it's a v-shape like this
that's just the valley was formed by the
water
flowing through or by through the
mountains through the rock and carving
the river bed gets lower and lower it
makes a v shape that's just
liquid water but this shape is caused by
frozen water okay i just drew a happy
face okay
so that's interesting but you have
u-shaped valleys those are caused by
glaciers okay interesting
sometimes landforms can change
quickly the moving continents can cause
earthquakes the land moves up and down
quickly an earthquake can cause
a landslide many rocks fall down
and land forms change
when a volcano erupts lava comes up
from the earth's mantle lava can make
new land and land forms quickly
the islands of hawaii were made
by a volcano and that's an interesting
point too
okay i i i don't know the geography or
the geology of
hawaii very well or the geography
actually but you know you have many
different islands and i'm
horrible at drawing
but i'll just do this very quickly so
hawaii is actually kind of a string of
islands and they kind of follow a line
and that line represents the volcano
imagine this
there's a volcano at the bottom of the
pacific ocean
the pacific ocean is very deep so for a
volcano
to grow and grow and grow
to come up above the surface of the
pacific ocean
that is a very very huge
mountain and we don't see all of it we
just see the top of it
and those are the islands of hawaii now
it's interesting because
this volcano is moving or actually the
volcano really isn't moving the landmass
is moving
but the the crust is moving and that hot
spot where the
lava is coming up is moving and that's
why it causes
it creates many volcanoes and that's why
hawaii is on a line
because and it they're hawaii the
islands are getting bigger
every year because more lava is coming
out and flowing down and creating more
rock
that sits at the top of the surface of
course it also falls into the ocean
and builds the mountain bigger and
bigger so the islands of hawaii
keep growing of course very little year
by year
but over thousands of years they will
grow more and more and maybe there will
be a new island coming up
in the next few thousand years who knows
i'd have to do more studies on that but
it's very interesting
that the islands of hawaii were made by
a volcano
or a series of volcanoes really okay
well that's our reading passage let's
take a look
at how it is organized
here we have cause and effect so this is
a very good
subject to talk about cause and effect
because we can see that there are slow
causes
and rapid causes to change the earth's
form what are some of them well first of
all cause
rain soaks into rocks wind blows on
rocks
now we talked about rain especially when
it's freezing
and melting but wind also of course
blows on the rock and that's a constant
force
that's you know slowly taking little
bits of the rock away
so what happens rocks what
they i said it already rocks where
away now if you're going to be
scientific you're going to say
rocks erode same thing right we talked
about that
in the vocabulary so you could say wear
away or you could say
rocks erode and then
next we have a beep moves down a
mountain and a valley can be made and
remember
i i talked about this in the reading if
you see a u-shaped valley
that is because of a glacier a glacier
came through there
thousands of years ago and
carved the rock out of it carried a lot
of rock took a lot of rock with it
as it moved down the mountain and it
created a u-shape in the rock
and that is a valley a valley
can be made the moving continents can
cause what remember when the moving
contents
especially when they move up against
each other and they get stuck
right all that pressure builds up builds
up and then all sudden it's released
right or something gives way
then that can cause what that can cause
an
earthquake earth quake
and an earthquake what is an earthquake
what is the effect of an earthquake
well the land moves up and down very
quickly and of course if it's in a
mountainous area
and the land is moving up and down very
quickly
anything on the mountain if it's not
very well supported will fall down
and you have landslides and that can
cause the earth
to change as well of course you can also
see big cracks can open up
in the earth as well okay finally
the cause lava we're talking about what
what
what carries lava to the surface it's a
big mountain
with a flat top we call that a volcano
volcano a volcano
uh carries lava from the
mantle to the surface lava erupts
because it doesn't come out
sometimes lava will come out slowly but
unfortunately sometimes lava comes out
with a lot of force and it erupts
and you have to be well away from the
volcano when that happens
of course geologists have very
sophisticated instruments and equipment
nowadays
they can predict when a volcano is going
to erupt
so pay attention to the scientists to
the geologists in your area
because they can warn you if there is a
volcano nearby if it's going to erupt
so lava erupts out of a volcano and lava
is molten rock right it comes out it
causes a lava flow
but it's cooling and if it cools enough
it'll stop
and create more land right it could
create a new island
like the islands of hawaii so variant
yeah if you do get a chance go to hawaii
and look at the active volcanoes be
careful stay
you know stay a good distance away from
them but it's a very amazing thing to
see
as the lava comes out and it flows down
to the ocean
and remember the hawaii is just a series
of volcanoes
that are so big they're sticking up
above the ocean's
surface okay very uh interesting
lesson i hope you learned a lot i hope
that it was interesting to you and
it kind of inspires you to learn more
about the earth and how it is changed
and
of course inspires you to learn more
about geology
which is the study of the earth and if
you study geology
you will study these ideas and these
causes and these effects
so anyway thanks for staying with me of
course and of course i hope you learned
uh some good words in english and that
you
help uh that it is helpful for you to
improve your english
language ability so anyway thanks for
studying with me as always
and we'll see you in the next lesson
take care everybody bye-bye
[Music]
you

hello everybody
00:09
welcome back to american textbook
00:11
reading my name is brian stewart
00:13
and in this lesson we're looking at
00:14
science book four
00:16
lesson seven and lesson seven is about
00:19
changes on earth so in this lesson you
00:22
will discover
00:24
how the earth's surface changes
00:27
and also how ice can change
00:30
rocks so let's begin
00:36
in the vocabulary section our first
00:39
item is actually two words it is a
00:42
phrasal verb soak into
00:46
what is a phrasal verb a verb
00:49
plus a preposition
00:52
so verb plus preposition is a phrasal
00:56
verb and english has a lot of phrasal
00:58
verbs
00:59
that correspond to a certain specific
01:02
idea in this case we have soak
01:06
into right you could just say soak but
01:09
into kind of gives it a more special
01:11
meaning it means
01:12
for a liquid to move into something
01:16
and make it wet so if it's raining
01:20
and the water soaks into your clothes
01:23
then you are thoroughly wet it's not
01:26
good it's miserable right so soak into
01:30
for a liquid to move into something and
01:32
make it completely wet
01:34
with that liquid okay
01:37
next we have another phrasal verb wow
01:40
this lesson has many
01:41
phrasal verbs here we have where
01:44
away so where is our verb
01:48
away is the preposition where
01:51
away where away means to cause something
01:54
to become
01:55
thinner smaller or weaker
01:59
over time so really everything wears
02:03
away right if you have an a toy for
02:07
example
02:08
and there's a new paint job on the toy
02:10
so
02:11
the paint is shiny and new at the
02:13
beginning but over time
02:15
as you leave your toy out in the sun or
02:17
maybe it gets
02:18
wet or as you play with it it rubs up
02:21
against the
02:22
walls of your room or the carpet or the
02:25
floor of your room
02:26
and over time you know the paint
02:30
wears away it becomes thinner it becomes
02:33
weaker and sometimes the paint will
02:36
wear away completely and then you can
02:38
see the metal
02:40
underneath the paint by the way most
02:43
phrasal verbs
02:44
in english preposition plus
02:47
i'm sorry verb plus preposition have
02:50
another
02:51
more formal word that corresponds to
02:54
them and i should mention
02:55
it for this word where away has a more
02:58
scientific word that we usually use it's
03:02
very common
03:03
and that is erode it's
03:06
one word erode and from a road
03:10
that's a verb we get the noun erosion
03:13
and that's exactly what we are talking
03:16
about
03:17
in this unit when we talk about wind
03:20
water other forces
03:24
acting on for example rocks and the
03:27
rocks over time they fall down they
03:29
become
03:29
smaller they become weaker or the rock
03:32
layer becomes thinner
03:33
we call that erosion that process is
03:37
called erosion
03:38
and we can say the rocks erode but it
03:41
means that they
03:41
wear away all similar ideas
03:45
okay good next we have
03:48
glacier now glacier is a noun right
03:52
glacier is a large body of ice
03:55
that moves slowly over land
03:59
did you know that about 10 000 years ago
04:04
before 10 000 years ago most of the
04:08
earth was covered with ice
04:12
there were huge glaciers
04:15
covering large surfaces
04:18
of the earth and of course this ice
04:21
moved very slowly of course if the ice
04:24
forms up high in the mountains
04:26
it will slowly move downwards
04:29
because of gravity obviously and as it
04:32
moves
04:33
it might carve it actually pushes rock
04:36
out of the way and so glaciers are very
04:39
important
04:40
nowadays it glaciers are becoming harder
04:44
and harder to find because the earth
04:47
is getting warmer year by year so there
04:50
are glaciers
04:51
for example in the alps in europe but
04:54
these glaciers are getting smaller
04:56
there are glaciers in the rocky
04:58
mountains in northern america
05:00
and also many in canada and of course if
05:04
you go to alaska
05:05
you can see glaciers next to the ocean
05:08
but these glaciers
05:09
are getting smaller and smaller every
05:11
year
05:12
as it gets warmer
05:16
next we have earthquake i hope you live
05:19
in an
05:20
area that does not have many earthquakes
05:23
but an earthquake this is the after
05:25
effect of an
05:26
earthquake an earthquake is the shaking
05:29
of the ground
05:30
caused by the earth's crust moving
05:33
the earth's crust now in the previous
05:36
lesson we talked about the three parts
05:38
of the earth right crust mantle and core
05:40
and we said that the continents on the
05:43
crust is moving very slowly
05:46
it's moving very slowly sure but it does
05:48
move
05:49
and what happens is when the earth's
05:52
crust moves
05:53
right it might hit another part of the
05:56
earth's crust
05:56
there's many cracks in the earth's crust
05:59
and sometimes the earth
06:00
the one crust will go down underneath
06:03
one or
06:04
it might go over another one or
06:06
sometimes they butt up
06:07
against each other and do this that's
06:09
how the himalayas
06:11
were formed between india and china
06:13
because two
06:14
parts of the earth's surface were moving
06:16
very slowly
06:17
but they're moving up against each other
06:19
and that's why the land is so high there
06:21
so anyway sometimes when the earth you
06:24
know whether it's moving
06:25
under or over sometimes it gets stuck
06:27
right because it's rock right it's not
06:29
smooth it doesn't smoothly go over each
06:31
other
06:32
but it will stick and for many years
06:35
that pressure's building up right
06:36
all this other rock is moving behind it
06:38
and it's just stuck because
06:40
you know some parts don't move together
06:42
very well and then all of a sudden that
06:44
pressure is so much
06:45
that something breaks and then that
06:48
causes a big shock wave
06:50
especially at that area and that shock
06:52
wave is called an
06:54
earthquake and that's why it causes a
06:56
lot of damage in certain areas
06:58
okay but that's an earthquake okay
07:01
volcano
07:02
is another interesting feature remember
07:04
again we talked about the crust the
07:05
mantle and the core
07:06
now in the crust of the earth is very
07:09
deep usually but in some parts
07:11
of the of the earth the crust is thin
07:14
and the mantle is relatively close to
07:17
the surface of the earth now remember we
07:19
talked about the mantle
07:20
it's very hot in the mantle and part of
07:23
the mantle is liquid rock
07:25
now that liquid rock is under a lot of
07:27
pressure and that pressure wants to be
07:29
relieved
07:30
so if it finds a way to come up through
07:32
the crust
07:34
of the earth's surface that will form a
07:36
volcano
07:37
and a volcano is basically a mountain
07:40
which
07:40
lava can come out of remember in the
07:43
previous lesson
07:44
i said lava is molten or melted rock
07:48
it's rock that is liquid it's very hot
07:50
and this
07:51
is a typical shape of a volcano
07:55
usually it has a flat top because inside
07:58
there's a crater
07:59
and there are many cracks that the lava
08:02
can come
08:02
up and you see the smoke because it's so
08:05
hot right
08:06
so that it creates smoke and when it
08:08
when it
08:09
erupts lava comes out
08:13
land form land form is a natural shape
08:16
on the earth's
08:17
surface so if you go to certain parts of
08:20
the world like the american west or
08:22
certain parts of deserts in china
08:24
you can see some very interesting
08:28
uh patterns in the rock look at this
08:30
this looks strange doesn't it
08:32
it looks like somebody you know the flat
08:34
earth somehow got tilted
08:36
how did it happen well remember when we
08:38
talked about
08:39
you know i gave you the example the two
08:41
parts of the crust hitting each other
08:42
and rising up
08:43
and forming the himalayas well that
08:45
pressure is enough
08:46
to make the flat rock turn up like that
08:50
and then when water or the rock erodes
08:53
or washes away
08:55
we can see the different layers of the
08:58
soil that
08:59
once were flat are now like this
09:02
and you can see that's very interesting
09:04
part of geology
09:05
the study of the earth and so you can
09:08
see that
09:08
in many places in the world especially
09:11
dry places
09:12
where the bushes and the trees and the
09:14
grass don't cover the ground or the dirt
09:17
you can see it very easily okay next we
09:22
have a landslide now landslides are
09:24
disasters right
09:26
this is when a large amount of rocks
09:28
fall
09:29
down a mountain or a slope
09:32
so again you know our earth is very big
09:34
there's a lot of pressures
09:37
on the crust of the earth and
09:40
as you know a mountain
09:43
which is made of rock or dirt over time
09:47
right
09:48
things wash away things erode things get
09:50
weaker so the support
09:51
that's holding rocks and dirt on a
09:53
mountain slot
09:54
on a mountain slope that support might
09:57
wear away and then all of a sudden those
09:59
rocks
10:00
or whatever it is will fall and that's a
10:02
landslide
10:03
it could be mud too if there's a lot of
10:05
rain
10:06
the the dirt becomes very wet
10:10
it has a lot of water in it it becomes
10:12
heavier if it's
10:13
on a slope of course it gets heavier it
10:15
might suddenly fall down
10:17
and if there's a village or town down
10:19
below that is a terrible
10:21
disaster sometimes we read about those
10:23
in the news
10:26
next we have erupt i mentioned that
10:28
earlier erupt
10:30
is like an explosion right there
10:33
eruption
10:34
oh erupt is the verb
10:37
eruption is the noun eruption so when a
10:40
volcano
10:41
erupts we call that an eruption
10:45
it's when the lava and the very hot
10:48
molten rocks and rocks of course are
10:51
also
10:52
forced out of a volcano because of all
10:53
that pressure in the mantle all that
10:55
heat
10:56
comes up to the surface and sometimes it
10:58
comes out
10:59
very violently with a lot of force
11:02
and that of course is an eruption we
11:04
have a video of that
11:06
check this video out this is a video of
11:08
a volcano
11:09
erupting look at how much power there is
11:12
let's take a look
11:14
so look it's it's kind of looks like
11:16
slow motion but
11:19
we don't really see the lava or the
11:21
rocks what we do see is a lot of
11:22
ash and a lot of smoke by the way that
11:25
can be very deadly
11:26
so if there is a volcano in the area you
11:29
have to worry about a lot of different
11:30
things
11:31
you don't want to be caught in that ash
11:33
because it's very hot it could burn your
11:35
lungs
11:36
also if you're caught in it there's not
11:38
enough oxygen to breathe so you could
11:40
you know you could die because you don't
11:42
get enough oxygen and of course it's
11:44
very hot there's hot rocks being thrown
11:46
out of it
11:46
there's a lot of lava coming out of it
11:49
it's a very dangerous
11:50
situation a very famous eruption in
11:53
history
11:54
was the eruption over pompeii an ancient
11:57
roman city and that eruption happened so
12:00
fast and the lava came down
12:01
so quickly that people died when they
12:04
were running away
12:06
from the volcano and many people just
12:08
died in their homes
12:09
they were just overcome by the fumes and
12:11
now it's a very famous
12:12
archaeological site but that's also so
12:15
volcanoes are
12:16
are very uh terrible disasters but they
12:19
have also been present
12:20
in human history for a long time okay
12:24
lava we've talked about lava several
12:26
times already
12:27
so here we have the word lava is hot
12:30
liquid
12:30
liquid rock it's rock that is a liquid
12:34
imagine that it has to be really really
12:36
hot
12:37
for rock to turn into a liquid
12:40
and you can see the liquid here it's red
12:42
and there's a lot of steam coming off it
12:44
because any moisture in the air that
12:46
touches that it turns into steam right
12:48
away
12:49
it's very hot and in fact you can see
12:51
lava flows
12:53
you can see lava flows that's what we
12:55
call them this is a lava flow
12:57
you can see lava flows sometimes in
12:59
hawaii it's kind of a tourist attraction
13:01
some people go to hawaii
13:03
because hawaii has many volcanoes and
13:05
the lava flows
13:06
go down to the ocean and they create a
13:08
lot of steam it's a very amazing sight
13:10
so a lava is a hot liquid that comes out
13:13
of a volcano okay those are our words
13:16
for the lesson
13:18
let's continue the first idea of this
13:22
lesson the first main idea
13:23
is that there are different changes on
13:25
the earth or
13:26
of the earth and there are slow changes
13:29
but there are also
13:30
rapid changes now remember the earth has
13:32
been around
13:33
for a very very very very
13:37
very long time okay i can't i can't put
13:39
enough varies
13:40
you can't even imagine four and a half
13:43
billion years
13:44
that is something that is
13:46
incomprehensible to most humans right
13:49
but so and it has changed over that time
13:51
but very slowly
13:52
however there are some times when the
13:54
earth changes very quickly
13:56
and we can see it so what are slow
13:59
changes on the earth
14:00
well wind and rain cause slow changes of
14:04
course
14:04
there's we've all experienced wind we've
14:07
all experienced rain
14:08
if you look around after a rain storm
14:10
everything seems pretty much the same
14:12
but a hundred years or a thousand years
14:16
or ten thousand years of wind and rain
14:19
on the same mountain will change that
14:21
mountain
14:22
it will wear away the rock and the rock
14:24
of the mountain will change
14:26
shape over thousands of years because of
14:28
erosion
14:30
we talked about that earlier now
14:31
glaciers are also very
14:33
slow causes of
14:36
change on the earth and of course a
14:38
glacier is a big body of ice and these
14:41
big bodies of ice they do move but they
14:43
move very slowly
14:44
and they can like i said they can change
14:47
the shape of the earth
14:48
below the great the glacier the weight
14:51
of that glacier can change
14:52
the shape it can also change the
14:55
material
14:56
under the glacier a lot of glaciers in
14:59
north america that moved from high spots
15:02
to low spots
15:03
they carried a lot of nutrients or rich
15:05
soil underneath them
15:06
and spread them out over the plains of
15:09
north america
15:10
and that's why there's very good farming
15:12
in
15:13
some states in northern america very
15:16
good soil
15:16
but that soil was carried there by
15:18
glaciers
15:20
okay so slow changes on earth what are
15:22
some rapid changes on earth we already
15:24
know we saw some in the vocabulary
15:26
first of all we have the earthquake
15:27
right when there's a sudden break in
15:29
that pressure
15:30
and the earth shakes the shock wave
15:32
makes the earth shake
15:33
that is an earthquake and that's very
15:35
rapid unfortunately
15:37
we can see that in in happen
15:40
over just a matter of minutes
15:44
a landslide is also something that can
15:46
happen in just a few
15:47
seconds right when a bunch of mud or
15:50
rocks
15:51
or dirt just suddenly loses support and
15:54
falls down the slope
15:55
of a hill or a mountain we call that a
15:58
landslide
15:59
and then of course the other example we
16:00
talked about when we were talking about
16:02
lava
16:03
is a volcano when a volcano erupts of
16:06
course we can see that
16:07
in real time we don't have to sit there
16:09
and watch it for a thousand years
16:11
we can't do that anyway but we can see a
16:13
volcano erupt
16:15
in just a few hours or maybe over days
16:18
but
16:18
when it does erupt it's just a few
16:20
seconds we can see it really
16:21
just a few minutes so there are slow
16:24
changes on earth
16:24
and there are rapid changes on earth
16:29
so when we look in detail at one of
16:31
those changes like for example glaciers
16:34
glaciers or ice how can ice change
16:37
rocks that's an interesting idea ice is
16:39
really just frozen water
16:41
water isn't as strong as a rock a rock
16:43
is heavier and stronger right
16:45
but ice can change rocks how well
16:49
remember water changes into ice when
16:51
it's cold
16:53
and then it melts when it's warm
16:56
so this contraction and expansion
16:59
especially if the water is in
17:00
cracks in the rock imagine that
17:03
expansion and contraction going on
17:05
so it's sometimes the water changes into
17:09
ice in cold weather so when the water
17:12
changes into ice
17:13
right ice expands and it's pushing the
17:16
rocks
17:17
apart right but then the ice later on in
17:20
the springtime
17:21
it gets warmer so the ice melts
17:25
and it drains away so after
17:28
you know the ice uh expanded it makes
17:31
the crack
17:31
bigger and it gets bigger and then the
17:34
water washes away maybe the water takes
17:36
some of the soil or rock with it
17:38
so the crack gets bigger and then rocks
17:41
with
17:41
large cracks as you know and this
17:44
happens over many years right
17:45
contraction
17:46
expansion contraction expansion so the
17:49
cracks are getting bigger
17:50
and then rocks with large cracks finally
17:53
they lose support uh holding each other
17:57
together and the rocks fall apart so
17:59
where you had one rock
18:01
now you have maybe two rocks or three
18:02
rocks or several different
18:04
smaller rocks of course this process
18:07
takes
18:08
many years it takes probably more years
18:11
than you are alive so we don't really
18:13
see
18:14
this we don't notice it but it does
18:16
happen over
18:17
long periods of time and rocks will
18:20
break apart
18:21
especially if the rocks are on a
18:22
mountainside and they break apart well
18:24
of course they're going to fall down
18:25
make a landslide so there are
18:29
these slow changes in the earth can also
18:32
cause
18:33
rapid changes in the earth's surface
18:36
okay let's move on to the reading
18:39
and as usual i'll read out loud repeat
18:42
after me
18:43
or repeat along in your mind and focus
18:46
on pronunciation
18:47
and also think about the vocabulary
18:50
of the words that we learned today let's
18:53
begin
18:54
earth's earth's that's a little hymduro
18:57
to pronounce right
18:58
earth so you stick your tongue out
19:02
between your
19:02
your teeth earth earth and then you
19:05
slowly
19:06
bring it back in to make the s sound
19:08
earth's
19:10
earth i'm sorry i'm doing it too too
19:12
much earth's
19:14
landforms are always changing
19:18
they usually change very very
19:22
slowly when continents
19:25
move against each other land
19:28
can be moved upwards this
19:31
is how mountains are made
19:35
weathering can change landforms
19:38
weathering is caused by rain and wind
19:43
rain soaks into rock
19:46
and the rock wears away the wind
19:50
also wears away rock
19:53
mountains can be worn down to become
19:57
hills
20:01
a glacier moves down a mountain very
20:04
slowly it wears away the mountain
20:09
[Music]
20:11
and takes rock with it glaciers
20:15
can make valleys by the way that's very
20:18
interesting i'm sorry to interrupt here
20:20
but you know i grew up partly
20:23
in the american west and when you go
20:26
hiking in the mountains
20:27
there are different types of valleys you
20:30
might have a v-shaped valley like this
20:32
and there's a stream running through the
20:34
valley right
20:35
and these are these are mountains right
20:38
however in other places you might be
20:41
hiking through
20:42
a valley and you look up and you see
20:44
that there is a u-shaped
20:46
valley now if you see a and then maybe
20:48
there's a little waterfall here because
20:51
this is still high land right here's the
20:53
valley floor
20:54
if you see a u-shaped valley like this
20:57
that means it was formed by a glacier
20:59
because the ice is very thick
21:01
and wide and moving through the mountain
21:03
if it's a v-shape like this
21:05
that's just the valley was formed by the
21:07
water
21:08
flowing through or by through the
21:11
mountains through the rock and carving
21:13
the river bed gets lower and lower it
21:15
makes a v shape that's just
21:16
liquid water but this shape is caused by
21:20
frozen water okay i just drew a happy
21:22
face okay
21:23
so that's interesting but you have
21:25
u-shaped valleys those are caused by
21:28
glaciers okay interesting
21:32
sometimes landforms can change
21:35
quickly the moving continents can cause
21:39
earthquakes the land moves up and down
21:43
quickly an earthquake can cause
21:47
a landslide many rocks fall down
21:51
and land forms change
21:56
when a volcano erupts lava comes up
21:59
from the earth's mantle lava can make
22:03
new land and land forms quickly
22:06
the islands of hawaii were made
22:10
by a volcano and that's an interesting
22:13
point too
22:14
okay i i i don't know the geography or
22:17
the geology of
22:18
hawaii very well or the geography
22:20
actually but you know you have many
22:22
different islands and i'm
22:23
horrible at drawing
22:26
but i'll just do this very quickly so
22:29
hawaii is actually kind of a string of
22:31
islands and they kind of follow a line
22:33
and that line represents the volcano
22:36
imagine this
22:37
there's a volcano at the bottom of the
22:39
pacific ocean
22:41
the pacific ocean is very deep so for a
22:44
volcano
22:45
to grow and grow and grow
22:48
to come up above the surface of the
22:50
pacific ocean
22:52
that is a very very huge
22:55
mountain and we don't see all of it we
22:58
just see the top of it
22:59
and those are the islands of hawaii now
23:02
it's interesting because
23:03
this volcano is moving or actually the
23:06
volcano really isn't moving the landmass
23:08
is moving
23:08
but the the crust is moving and that hot
23:11
spot where the
23:12
lava is coming up is moving and that's
23:15
why it causes
23:16
it creates many volcanoes and that's why
23:19
hawaii is on a line
23:21
because and it they're hawaii the
23:23
islands are getting bigger
23:25
every year because more lava is coming
23:27
out and flowing down and creating more
23:29
rock
23:30
that sits at the top of the surface of
23:31
course it also falls into the ocean
23:33
and builds the mountain bigger and
23:35
bigger so the islands of hawaii
23:37
keep growing of course very little year
23:40
by year
23:40
but over thousands of years they will
23:44
grow more and more and maybe there will
23:46
be a new island coming up
23:47
in the next few thousand years who knows
23:50
i'd have to do more studies on that but
23:52
it's very interesting
23:53
that the islands of hawaii were made by
23:56
a volcano
23:56
or a series of volcanoes really okay
24:00
well that's our reading passage let's
24:02
take a look
24:03
at how it is organized
24:07
here we have cause and effect so this is
24:09
a very good
24:10
subject to talk about cause and effect
24:12
because we can see that there are slow
24:13
causes
24:14
and rapid causes to change the earth's
24:18
form what are some of them well first of
24:20
all cause
24:21
rain soaks into rocks wind blows on
24:24
rocks
24:24
now we talked about rain especially when
24:26
it's freezing
24:28
and melting but wind also of course
24:30
blows on the rock and that's a constant
24:32
force
24:33
that's you know slowly taking little
24:35
bits of the rock away
24:37
so what happens rocks what
24:40
they i said it already rocks where
24:44
away now if you're going to be
24:46
scientific you're going to say
24:48
rocks erode same thing right we talked
24:51
about that
24:52
in the vocabulary so you could say wear
24:54
away or you could say
24:55
rocks erode and then
24:58
next we have a beep moves down a
25:01
mountain and a valley can be made and
25:03
remember
25:03
i i talked about this in the reading if
25:06
you see a u-shaped valley
25:08
that is because of a glacier a glacier
25:11
came through there
25:13
thousands of years ago and
25:16
carved the rock out of it carried a lot
25:19
of rock took a lot of rock with it
25:21
as it moved down the mountain and it
25:23
created a u-shape in the rock
25:25
and that is a valley a valley
25:29
can be made the moving continents can
25:32
cause what remember when the moving
25:34
contents
25:34
especially when they move up against
25:36
each other and they get stuck
25:38
right all that pressure builds up builds
25:39
up and then all sudden it's released
25:41
right or something gives way
25:43
then that can cause what that can cause
25:47
an
25:47
earthquake earth quake
25:52
and an earthquake what is an earthquake
25:54
what is the effect of an earthquake
25:56
well the land moves up and down very
25:58
quickly and of course if it's in a
26:00
mountainous area
26:01
and the land is moving up and down very
26:04
quickly
26:05
anything on the mountain if it's not
26:07
very well supported will fall down
26:09
and you have landslides and that can
26:10
cause the earth
26:12
to change as well of course you can also
26:14
see big cracks can open up
26:16
in the earth as well okay finally
26:19
the cause lava we're talking about what
26:22
what
26:23
what carries lava to the surface it's a
26:26
big mountain
26:26
with a flat top we call that a volcano
26:31
volcano a volcano
26:34
uh carries lava from the
26:38
mantle to the surface lava erupts
26:40
because it doesn't come out
26:43
sometimes lava will come out slowly but
26:45
unfortunately sometimes lava comes out
26:47
with a lot of force and it erupts
26:50
and you have to be well away from the
26:52
volcano when that happens
26:54
of course geologists have very
26:55
sophisticated instruments and equipment
26:58
nowadays
26:58
they can predict when a volcano is going
27:01
to erupt
27:02
so pay attention to the scientists to
27:04
the geologists in your area
27:06
because they can warn you if there is a
27:09
volcano nearby if it's going to erupt
27:12
so lava erupts out of a volcano and lava
27:15
is molten rock right it comes out it
27:18
causes a lava flow
27:19
but it's cooling and if it cools enough
27:21
it'll stop
27:22
and create more land right it could
27:25
create a new island
27:26
like the islands of hawaii so variant
27:30
yeah if you do get a chance go to hawaii
27:32
and look at the active volcanoes be
27:34
careful stay
27:35
you know stay a good distance away from
27:37
them but it's a very amazing thing to
27:39
see
27:40
as the lava comes out and it flows down
27:42
to the ocean
27:43
and remember the hawaii is just a series
27:45
of volcanoes
27:46
that are so big they're sticking up
27:48
above the ocean's
27:50
surface okay very uh interesting
27:53
lesson i hope you learned a lot i hope
27:55
that it was interesting to you and
27:57
it kind of inspires you to learn more
28:00
about the earth and how it is changed
28:03
and
28:03
of course inspires you to learn more
28:05
about geology
28:07
which is the study of the earth and if
28:09
you study geology
28:10
you will study these ideas and these
28:13
causes and these effects
28:15
so anyway thanks for staying with me of
28:17
course and of course i hope you learned
28:19
uh some good words in english and that
28:22
you
28:22
help uh that it is helpful for you to
28:25
improve your english
28:27
language ability so anyway thanks for
28:29
studying with me as always
28:30
and we'll see you in the next lesson
28:32
take care everybody bye-bye
28:48
[Music]
28:54
you
