hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary
we're on unit 4 we're talking about
world connections
lesson 10 is talking about going places
how about you have you traveled in your
life or
have you moved your house from one place
to another
maybe you grew up in one city and moved
and lived in another city
well we're going to focus on the history
of transportation right because human
beings have been around for a very long
time
and human beings like to travel right
it's part of who we are okay so that's
what we're going to talk about
in this lesson but first let's learn
some vocabulary words
the first word we're going to go over
wow this
is very exciting right it's going very
fast of course this
is what kind of thing it's a long
vehicle
a long very long vehicle that travels
on rails these are rails
what do we call that of course you know
it's called
a train right korea has a very good
train system ktx right
the bullet train it's very fast you can
go from seoul
to busan in three and a half hours very
good
okay but that's a train okay the second
word here
anything anything that carries people
over land water or sea of course we can
see a plane here
we talked about train but we're talking
about anything it could be a plane
a train a car a boat
all of these things what do we call
these things they carry people
over land water or sea carry people
anywhere in the world we call this
system
transportation
long word so trans poor
tay shun for syllables
let's say it a little bit more quickly
though like a native speaker
transportation transportation
okay transportation okay that is
basically anything that carries people
from one place to another
but transportation is usually thought of
as a system
right or uh a type of uh
vehicle right it's a type for example a
train
is a type of transportation
a plane is a type of transportation
so when we talk about transportation
we're not talking about
one vehicle or a specific vehicle
we're talking about any all types
of vehicles anything okay but if you're
going to talk about specific type
then say boat or car train or plane
but you could also to use transportation
you can say
transportation is very good in korea for
example
the transportation system is very good
in korea okay next one three
whoa what's this this looks a little
strange but if you look carefully
and closely you get it pretty quickly
of course you find this in your car if
your family has a car of course
probably do you open the hood of the car
and you can see this this is what makes
the car go
it's a machine that provides power it
provides
power to your car right it's called an
engine but engines of course are also in
trains they're in planes
and they're in automobiles right planes
trains and automobiles
boats all types of transportation not
all types a bicycle
is a type of transportation but it
doesn't have an engine
right so you think of the powerful types
of transportation
they have an engine but other types of
transportation that are slower
we use our our power human power
or animal power horses and carts
right but most modern transportation
uses
an engine okay next one well this is
very
interesting it's very g car right a very
cute
car useful and sensible so this is a
useful car
it's sensible because it doesn't waste a
lot of
gas it only uses enough gas that it
needs
so we say something is practical it's
practical
it's enough to get the job done we don't
waste time
we don't waste money it's practical
okay useful and sensible
next one a great achievement something
that is a great achievement
we say it is a feat not your
pal right pal anio not feet f-e-t
but feet f-e-a-t pronunciation
is the same as feet right
but feet means achievement if you
have done something spectacular you have
done something great
maybe you won an award that was a great
feat you accomplished an impressive feat
f-e-a-t not nam say right
not not that okay not feet okay next one
six to move through the sky on the wind
so birds do this some kinds of airplanes
do this
people can do this too if they have a
certain device
it's called a hang glider but anyway
when birds are doing this they're not
moving their wings they're just have
their wings out
and the wind helps them keep in the air
and they're just
floating they're like floating around we
say they are
soaring to soar some types of airplanes
right they don't have an engine
they go up in the air they're being
pulled up in the air by another plane
and then they're released and then they
just kind of glide down
back to the earth they're soaring
through the air to
soar a vehicle that travels through the
air
i was talking about it already quite a
lot i've mentioned it already many times
of course it is an a plane or an
aircraft
so remember we can say airplane or just
plane we can also say aircraft it's a
vehicle
that travels through the air now
aircraft
many different types of aircraft right a
hang glider
you can say is a type of aircraft but
it's not a plane
a hang glider right that's where the
people get in they just have a bar
and there's this big wing above them and
they just float they soar through the
air
right that's a type of aircraft but
mostly we're talking about planes
mostly when we talk about aircraft we're
talking about planes and of course
passenger planes fighter jet planes
small stunt planes there's many
different types of planes
okay hot water in the air when you cook
tea
when you cook tea when you make tea when
you make don't say cooked
when you make tea of course you want the
water to
boil right so hot water will come out in
the air once it's boiling
and we call that steam be careful right
steam apa right joshua be careful
because steam can be dangerous
right of course in this situation maybe
not so dangerous
but in a factory or something be careful
right because there's a lot of steam
there can be a lot of steam nine to make
disappear and then appear in a different
place
to make something disappear and then
disappear here
and then make it appear in another place
so basically i move it
from here to there very quickly this is
not real
we only see this in science fiction
movies nowadays
of course star trek was very famous for
their
what teleporter teleporter okay
they could teleport people uh from their
ship to
the planet down below okay
so that's called teleport that's not
real it's only in our imagination
nobody can do this yet people are trying
to figure out how to do it
but it's not possible to do it now okay
teleport
okay next one a vehicle that can travel
into space what is that of course you're
very excited about
reading about these and hearing about
these astronauts will go into space
on these vehicles they are also a type
of aircraft but we call them
a rocket rocket okay so a rocket is
a type of aircraft right we saw that
word before
many types of aircraft mostly we talk
about planes but rocket
is also another type of aircraft but
this one
goes into space okay
remember i was talking to you about this
one before i wrote it on the uh
board a one or two person aircraft
with no engine it is a hang
glider i taught that to you before this
is a very
interesting very exciting aircraft right
it's a little dangerous
right if you do this you have to be an
adult to do this and you
have to have a lot of training to be
able to do this
but this is very amazing isn't it it
would be really cool to be able to do
this
and this is a one or two person two
people can sometimes fly in it
there's no engine you jump off a
mountain and you fly
you soar through the air next one a
thing that spins and pulls air or water
so on older airplanes on older airplanes
there we have this this is called a
propeller
propeller propeller
propeller that might be a little
difficult to pronounce
pro pel er
propeller and these are of course on
older airplanes right nowadays most
airplanes use
jet engines jets
most airplanes are jets nowadays
especially the big airplanes that you
travel to another country
they use jets but smaller airplanes and
older airplanes
they'll use propellers okay next one
a basic vehicle with four wheels right
before when i was talking about
engines right not all transportation
has engines there's no engine on this
vehicle
right but what do we call this we call
this a carriage
carriage carriage now you may know about
carriages
from fairy tales right when you read the
fairy tale about
cinderella right a carriage comes to
take her to the ball
and then the carriage comes is supposed
to bring her back home
before it turns into the little mice and
the pumpkin right so we know about
carriages from fairy tales
carriages were very common hundreds of
years ago
before the invention of the car rich
people
would ride around in carriages
okay a fuel that powers
cars of course if you are with your mom
or dad you're driving around they have
to stop
at a jew you sow right a gas station
once in a while
so a fuel that powers car is gas
gas station in korean you say juyuso
right
but we say gas station in america
in england in britain they say petrol
petrol so british english they will say
i need some petrol for my car
but americans don't use the word petrol
they
if you say petrol in america people will
know what you're talking about
but they hardly ever use that word so
think that's kind of strange did you
learn
english in britain right so most
americans will say just gas
i need gas for my car let's go to a gas
station british people say we need to
get some petrol let's go to a petrol
station
okay so gas next one
a large balloon filled with hot air that
carries
people okay this is also very exciting
that would be fun to ride in right
of course it's a safer than a hang
glider right you don't have to have as
much training
you just have to be with a person who
knows what he's doing or she's doing
so what we call this we call this a hot
air
balloon and of course we see all the
words there hot air
balloon right it's a big balloon not a
balloon that you hold in your hand at a
birthday party no
this is really big and it uses hot air
to go up in the sky right so it's a hot
air balloon okay last one
having to do with sunlight so these are
becoming more and more
popular these days right this is like
future
technology maybe the future will depend
on this type of technology what are
these these are like
panels panel
right a panel is just a flat surface
right but these are what kinds of panel
they have to do with sunlight
we call them solar panels but
this word here is an adjective and we
use that word
in front of anything that uses sunlight
solar panel solar car
solar whatever okay this is an adjective
that we use
in front of nouns to describe that they
have to do
with sunlight or usually nowadays that
they get their
energy from the sun solar panel gets its
energy
from the sun from sunlight okay those
are our words
let's go over the exercises for that
vocabulary
the first problem here is after a hot
shower
hot shower is good in the morning on a
winter day isn't it
okay a hot shower the bathroom air fills
with
what so of course if it's winter you're
taking a hot
shower in the morning or at night before
you go to bed well actually that's
may make you go to sleep but anyway in
the bathroom you notice
i can't see right if you have glass you
have to wipe the glass
why because the water is hot it gets in
the air
and what do we call that is it gas is it
smoke
is it steam or is it soap okay
we might say oh it's smoke no it's not
smoke smoke is from a fire right
this is water water vapor it's not gas
it's not soap right be careful don't get
soap in your eyes
what is it of course we know it's steam
right
hot air sorry water that gets very hot
hot water if it's very hot it will
become
steam and of course when you're taking a
hot shower there's a lot of steam
in the bathroom if you go to a sauna
there's a lot of steam people like it
it's healthy for them okay three
a hammer is not very beep for cooking
food
so we're talking about something that is
useful
or sensible to use for something else
do we use a hammer to cook food
a hammer we use to pound a nail into
wood
you don't use a hammer for cooking food
that's crazy right
so how do we use that those an adjective
a hammer is not very
beep is not very what for cooking food
so it's
not a silly be practical
c big d useless remember the word
not here if we said a hammer is not very
silly you might choose silly because oh
that's silly to use a hammer
for cooking food but we're using not so
not silly
means that it's okay but that's not
right a hammer is not okay
to use for cooking food so silly doesn't
work
what about practical not practical
ah not practical practical means useful
sensible right a hammer is not pr not
practical it's not useful it's not
sensible
so that's our answer b is not big that
doesn't
fit and useless remember not
not useless if we got rid of not we said
a hammer is
useless for cooking food that's okay if
we said a hammer
is silly for cooking food that would be
okay
but we're using not so the adjective
has to be appropriate not practical for
cooking food
it's not useful okay okay next one
five we took the beep it was faster than
the car
or bus and cheaper than a plane so
that's interesting this uh problem kind
of
eliminates choices for you
so you took something in other words you
took some type of transportation
we take transportation you can take a
plane you can take a boat you can take a
taxi
you can take a car or whatever so we
take some type of transportation
but what kind of transportation well we
know what it's not
we know it's not a car not a bus
and we know it's not a plane okay but we
also know a couple more clues
it was faster than faster than a car
faster than a bus not faster than a
plane
just cheaper than a plane interesting so
those are the clues
not a car not a bus not a plane faster
than a car faster than a bus
and cheaper not as expensive as a plane
what could it be
our choices are horse rocket train or
bicycle
well let's look at them a horse is a
horse faster
than a car or a bus no of course not
cars are much faster than horses they
can go much longer distances
and much quicker so it's not a horse
a rocket okay faster than a car bus yeah
a rocket is faster than a car or bus
is it cheaper than a plane no rockets
are really really
expensive okay you have to be a
millionaire to go into space on a rocket
if you're going to pay for it
okay what about a train a train is
faster than a car bus
that's true it's cheaper than a plane
yeah train tickets are usually
a lot cheaper than plane tickets that's
our answer
train we took the train faster than a
car
bus and cheaper than a plane it's not
faster than a plane
it's just cheaper than a plane and
bicycle
we know bicycles not faster than a car
or bus so that's not the answer either
okay number seven rockets are the
fastest
beep in the world rockets are the
fastest
what our choices are trains b aircraft
c flight d steam so right away we see
that
flight doesn't work because flight is
not a
type of vehicle neither is steam steam
is not a type of vehicle
that leaves us with trains or aircrafts
is a rocket a type of train
no it's not a type of train it's a type
of aircraft
so rockets are the fastest aircraft in
the world
remember i said before aircraft there
are many many different types of
aircraft
planes hang gliders and also rockets
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
section for this unit
let's take a short break we'll come back
and look at the reading don't go away

00:30
and lived in another city
00:32
well we're going to focus on the history
00:36
of transportation right because human
00:38
beings have been around for a very long
00:40
time
00:41
and human beings like to travel right
00:44
it's part of who we are okay so that's
00:47
what we're going to talk about
00:48
in this lesson but first let's learn
00:51
some vocabulary words
00:53
the first word we're going to go over
00:55
wow this
00:56
is very exciting right it's going very
00:58
fast of course this
00:59
is what kind of thing it's a long
01:02
vehicle
01:03
a long very long vehicle that travels
01:07
on rails these are rails
01:10
what do we call that of course you know
01:13
it's called
01:14
a train right korea has a very good
01:17
train system ktx right
01:19
the bullet train it's very fast you can
01:21
go from seoul
01:23
to busan in three and a half hours very
01:25
good
01:26
okay but that's a train okay the second
01:29
word here
01:30
anything anything that carries people
01:34
over land water or sea of course we can
01:37
see a plane here
01:38
we talked about train but we're talking
01:40
about anything it could be a plane
01:42
a train a car a boat
01:45
all of these things what do we call
01:47
these things they carry people
01:49
over land water or sea carry people
01:52
anywhere in the world we call this
01:54
system
01:58
transportation
02:00
long word so trans poor
02:04
tay shun for syllables
02:08
let's say it a little bit more quickly
02:09
though like a native speaker
02:12
transportation transportation
02:15
okay transportation okay that is
02:19
basically anything that carries people
02:21
from one place to another
02:23
but transportation is usually thought of
02:25
as a system
02:26
right or uh a type of uh
02:30
vehicle right it's a type for example a
02:32
train
02:33
is a type of transportation
02:36
a plane is a type of transportation
02:40
so when we talk about transportation
02:42
we're not talking about
02:43
one vehicle or a specific vehicle
02:46
we're talking about any all types
02:50
of vehicles anything okay but if you're
02:52
going to talk about specific type
02:54
then say boat or car train or plane
02:57
but you could also to use transportation
03:00
you can say
03:01
transportation is very good in korea for
03:05
example
03:05
the transportation system is very good
03:09
in korea okay next one three
03:12
whoa what's this this looks a little
03:13
strange but if you look carefully
03:15
and closely you get it pretty quickly
03:18
of course you find this in your car if
03:22
your family has a car of course
03:23
probably do you open the hood of the car
03:27
and you can see this this is what makes
03:29
the car go
03:30
it's a machine that provides power it
03:33
provides
03:34
power to your car right it's called an
03:37
engine but engines of course are also in
03:40
trains they're in planes
03:42
and they're in automobiles right planes
03:44
trains and automobiles
03:46
boats all types of transportation not
03:49
all types a bicycle
03:50
is a type of transportation but it
03:52
doesn't have an engine
03:54
right so you think of the powerful types
03:56
of transportation
03:57
they have an engine but other types of
03:59
transportation that are slower
04:02
we use our our power human power
04:05
or animal power horses and carts
04:08
right but most modern transportation
04:11
uses
04:11
an engine okay next one well this is
04:14
very
04:15
interesting it's very g car right a very
04:18
cute
04:18
car useful and sensible so this is a
04:22
useful car
04:23
it's sensible because it doesn't waste a
04:25
lot of
04:26
gas it only uses enough gas that it
04:28
needs
04:29
so we say something is practical it's
04:32
practical
04:32
it's enough to get the job done we don't
04:36
waste time
04:36
we don't waste money it's practical
04:40
okay useful and sensible
04:43
next one a great achievement something
04:47
that is a great achievement
04:48
we say it is a feat not your
04:51
pal right pal anio not feet f-e-t
04:55
but feet f-e-a-t pronunciation
04:59
is the same as feet right
05:03
but feet means achievement if you
05:06
have done something spectacular you have
05:08
done something great
05:09
maybe you won an award that was a great
05:13
feat you accomplished an impressive feat
05:16
f-e-a-t not nam say right
05:20
not not that okay not feet okay next one
05:24
six to move through the sky on the wind
05:28
so birds do this some kinds of airplanes
05:31
do this
05:32
people can do this too if they have a
05:34
certain device
05:36
it's called a hang glider but anyway
05:38
when birds are doing this they're not
05:40
moving their wings they're just have
05:41
their wings out
05:42
and the wind helps them keep in the air
05:46
and they're just
05:46
floating they're like floating around we
05:49
say they are
05:49
soaring to soar some types of airplanes
05:53
right they don't have an engine
05:54
they go up in the air they're being
05:56
pulled up in the air by another plane
05:58
and then they're released and then they
06:00
just kind of glide down
06:02
back to the earth they're soaring
06:03
through the air to
06:05
soar a vehicle that travels through the
06:08
air
06:09
i was talking about it already quite a
06:11
lot i've mentioned it already many times
06:13
of course it is an a plane or an
06:16
aircraft
06:17
so remember we can say airplane or just
06:20
plane we can also say aircraft it's a
06:24
vehicle
06:24
that travels through the air now
06:27
aircraft
06:28
many different types of aircraft right a
06:31
hang glider
06:32
you can say is a type of aircraft but
06:35
it's not a plane
06:37
a hang glider right that's where the
06:40
people get in they just have a bar
06:42
and there's this big wing above them and
06:45
they just float they soar through the
06:47
air
06:47
right that's a type of aircraft but
06:49
mostly we're talking about planes
06:51
mostly when we talk about aircraft we're
06:53
talking about planes and of course
06:55
passenger planes fighter jet planes
06:59
small stunt planes there's many
07:02
different types of planes
07:05
okay hot water in the air when you cook
07:08
tea
07:09
when you cook tea when you make tea when
07:11
you make don't say cooked
07:12
when you make tea of course you want the
07:15
water to
07:16
boil right so hot water will come out in
07:19
the air once it's boiling
07:20
and we call that steam be careful right
07:23
steam apa right joshua be careful
07:26
because steam can be dangerous
07:28
right of course in this situation maybe
07:31
not so dangerous
07:32
but in a factory or something be careful
07:34
right because there's a lot of steam
07:36
there can be a lot of steam nine to make
07:39
disappear and then appear in a different
07:42
place
07:42
to make something disappear and then
07:45
disappear here
07:46
and then make it appear in another place
07:48
so basically i move it
07:50
from here to there very quickly this is
07:52
not real
07:53
we only see this in science fiction
07:55
movies nowadays
07:56
of course star trek was very famous for
07:59
their
08:00
what teleporter teleporter okay
08:04
they could teleport people uh from their
08:06
ship to
08:07
the planet down below okay
08:10
so that's called teleport that's not
08:13
real it's only in our imagination
08:15
nobody can do this yet people are trying
08:18
to figure out how to do it
08:19
but it's not possible to do it now okay
08:22
teleport
08:24
okay next one a vehicle that can travel
08:27
into space what is that of course you're
08:30
very excited about
08:31
reading about these and hearing about
08:33
these astronauts will go into space
08:36
on these vehicles they are also a type
08:38
of aircraft but we call them
08:41
a rocket rocket okay so a rocket is
08:44
a type of aircraft right we saw that
08:47
word before
08:48
many types of aircraft mostly we talk
08:50
about planes but rocket
08:51
is also another type of aircraft but
08:55
this one
08:55
goes into space okay
08:59
remember i was talking to you about this
09:01
one before i wrote it on the uh
09:03
board a one or two person aircraft
09:06
with no engine it is a hang
09:10
glider i taught that to you before this
09:13
is a very
09:13
interesting very exciting aircraft right
09:17
it's a little dangerous
09:18
right if you do this you have to be an
09:20
adult to do this and you
09:22
have to have a lot of training to be
09:24
able to do this
09:25
but this is very amazing isn't it it
09:27
would be really cool to be able to do
09:28
this
09:29
and this is a one or two person two
09:31
people can sometimes fly in it
09:33
there's no engine you jump off a
09:36
mountain and you fly
09:38
you soar through the air next one a
09:40
thing that spins and pulls air or water
09:43
so on older airplanes on older airplanes
09:47
there we have this this is called a
09:49
propeller
09:52
propeller propeller
09:55
propeller that might be a little
09:56
difficult to pronounce
09:58
pro pel er
10:01
propeller and these are of course on
10:04
older airplanes right nowadays most
10:07
airplanes use
10:09
jet engines jets
10:12
most airplanes are jets nowadays
10:14
especially the big airplanes that you
10:16
travel to another country
10:17
they use jets but smaller airplanes and
10:20
older airplanes
10:21
they'll use propellers okay next one
10:25
a basic vehicle with four wheels right
10:28
before when i was talking about
10:29
engines right not all transportation
10:32
has engines there's no engine on this
10:35
vehicle
10:36
right but what do we call this we call
10:38
this a carriage
10:40
carriage carriage now you may know about
10:44
carriages
10:44
from fairy tales right when you read the
10:46
fairy tale about
10:47
cinderella right a carriage comes to
10:50
take her to the ball
10:52
and then the carriage comes is supposed
10:54
to bring her back home
10:55
before it turns into the little mice and
10:57
the pumpkin right so we know about
10:59
carriages from fairy tales
11:01
carriages were very common hundreds of
11:04
years ago
11:05
before the invention of the car rich
11:08
people
11:08
would ride around in carriages
11:12
okay a fuel that powers
11:15
cars of course if you are with your mom
11:18
or dad you're driving around they have
11:20
to stop
11:21
at a jew you sow right a gas station
11:23
once in a while
11:25
so a fuel that powers car is gas
11:28
gas station in korean you say juyuso
11:31
right
11:31
but we say gas station in america
11:35
in england in britain they say petrol
11:40
petrol so british english they will say
11:42
i need some petrol for my car
11:44
but americans don't use the word petrol
11:47
they
11:47
if you say petrol in america people will
11:50
know what you're talking about
11:51
but they hardly ever use that word so
11:54
think that's kind of strange did you
11:55
learn
11:56
english in britain right so most
11:58
americans will say just gas
12:00
i need gas for my car let's go to a gas
12:03
station british people say we need to
12:06
get some petrol let's go to a petrol
12:08
station
12:08
okay so gas next one
12:12
a large balloon filled with hot air that
12:15
carries
12:15
people okay this is also very exciting
12:18
that would be fun to ride in right
12:20
of course it's a safer than a hang
12:22
glider right you don't have to have as
12:24
much training
12:25
you just have to be with a person who
12:27
knows what he's doing or she's doing
12:29
so what we call this we call this a hot
12:32
air
12:32
balloon and of course we see all the
12:34
words there hot air
12:36
balloon right it's a big balloon not a
12:38
balloon that you hold in your hand at a
12:40
birthday party no
12:42
this is really big and it uses hot air
12:45
to go up in the sky right so it's a hot
12:49
air balloon okay last one
12:52
having to do with sunlight so these are
12:55
becoming more and more
12:57
popular these days right this is like
12:59
future
13:00
technology maybe the future will depend
13:04
on this type of technology what are
13:06
these these are like
13:07
panels panel
13:10
right a panel is just a flat surface
13:14
right but these are what kinds of panel
13:16
they have to do with sunlight
13:18
we call them solar panels but
13:21
this word here is an adjective and we
13:24
use that word
13:25
in front of anything that uses sunlight
13:29
solar panel solar car
13:32
solar whatever okay this is an adjective
13:36
that we use
13:37
in front of nouns to describe that they
13:40
have to do
13:41
with sunlight or usually nowadays that
13:44
they get their
13:44
energy from the sun solar panel gets its
13:48
energy
13:48
from the sun from sunlight okay those
13:51
are our words
13:52
let's go over the exercises for that
13:56
vocabulary
13:57
the first problem here is after a hot
14:00
shower
14:01
hot shower is good in the morning on a
14:03
winter day isn't it
14:04
okay a hot shower the bathroom air fills
14:07
with
14:08
what so of course if it's winter you're
14:10
taking a hot
14:11
shower in the morning or at night before
14:13
you go to bed well actually that's
14:15
may make you go to sleep but anyway in
14:18
the bathroom you notice
14:19
i can't see right if you have glass you
14:22
have to wipe the glass
14:24
why because the water is hot it gets in
14:27
the air
14:27
and what do we call that is it gas is it
14:30
smoke
14:31
is it steam or is it soap okay
14:35
we might say oh it's smoke no it's not
14:36
smoke smoke is from a fire right
14:39
this is water water vapor it's not gas
14:42
it's not soap right be careful don't get
14:44
soap in your eyes
14:46
what is it of course we know it's steam
14:48
right
14:49
hot air sorry water that gets very hot
14:52
hot water if it's very hot it will
14:55
become
14:56
steam and of course when you're taking a
14:58
hot shower there's a lot of steam
15:00
in the bathroom if you go to a sauna
15:02
there's a lot of steam people like it
15:04
it's healthy for them okay three
15:08
a hammer is not very beep for cooking
15:11
food
15:12
so we're talking about something that is
15:15
useful
15:16
or sensible to use for something else
15:19
do we use a hammer to cook food
15:22
a hammer we use to pound a nail into
15:26
wood
15:26
you don't use a hammer for cooking food
15:28
that's crazy right
15:30
so how do we use that those an adjective
15:33
a hammer is not very
15:35
beep is not very what for cooking food
15:39
so it's
15:40
not a silly be practical
15:43
c big d useless remember the word
15:46
not here if we said a hammer is not very
15:50
silly you might choose silly because oh
15:52
that's silly to use a hammer
15:54
for cooking food but we're using not so
15:57
not silly
15:58
means that it's okay but that's not
16:00
right a hammer is not okay
16:02
to use for cooking food so silly doesn't
16:04
work
16:05
what about practical not practical
16:08
ah not practical practical means useful
16:12
sensible right a hammer is not pr not
16:15
practical it's not useful it's not
16:17
sensible
16:18
so that's our answer b is not big that
16:21
doesn't
16:22
fit and useless remember not
16:25
not useless if we got rid of not we said
16:28
a hammer is
16:29
useless for cooking food that's okay if
16:32
we said a hammer
16:33
is silly for cooking food that would be
16:36
okay
16:37
but we're using not so the adjective
16:41
has to be appropriate not practical for
16:44
cooking food
16:44
it's not useful okay okay next one
16:48
five we took the beep it was faster than
16:52
the car
16:52
or bus and cheaper than a plane so
16:56
that's interesting this uh problem kind
16:59
of
16:59
eliminates choices for you
17:02
so you took something in other words you
17:05
took some type of transportation
17:07
we take transportation you can take a
17:09
plane you can take a boat you can take a
17:11
taxi
17:12
you can take a car or whatever so we
17:14
take some type of transportation
17:17
but what kind of transportation well we
17:20
know what it's not
17:21
we know it's not a car not a bus
17:24
and we know it's not a plane okay but we
17:28
also know a couple more clues
17:30
it was faster than faster than a car
17:33
faster than a bus not faster than a
17:36
plane
17:37
just cheaper than a plane interesting so
17:40
those are the clues
17:41
not a car not a bus not a plane faster
17:44
than a car faster than a bus
17:46
and cheaper not as expensive as a plane
17:48
what could it be
17:49
our choices are horse rocket train or
17:52
bicycle
17:53
well let's look at them a horse is a
17:55
horse faster
17:56
than a car or a bus no of course not
17:59
cars are much faster than horses they
18:02
can go much longer distances
18:04
and much quicker so it's not a horse
18:07
a rocket okay faster than a car bus yeah
18:10
a rocket is faster than a car or bus
18:13
is it cheaper than a plane no rockets
18:16
are really really
18:16
expensive okay you have to be a
18:18
millionaire to go into space on a rocket
18:21
if you're going to pay for it
18:23
okay what about a train a train is
18:25
faster than a car bus
18:26
that's true it's cheaper than a plane
18:28
yeah train tickets are usually
18:30
a lot cheaper than plane tickets that's
18:34
our answer
18:34
train we took the train faster than a
18:37
car
18:37
bus and cheaper than a plane it's not
18:40
faster than a plane
18:42
it's just cheaper than a plane and
18:44
bicycle
18:45
we know bicycles not faster than a car
18:48
or bus so that's not the answer either
18:51
okay number seven rockets are the
18:53
fastest
18:54
beep in the world rockets are the
18:56
fastest
18:57
what our choices are trains b aircraft
19:00
c flight d steam so right away we see
19:04
that
19:04
flight doesn't work because flight is
19:07
not a
19:07
type of vehicle neither is steam steam
19:11
is not a type of vehicle
19:13
that leaves us with trains or aircrafts
19:15
is a rocket a type of train
19:18
no it's not a type of train it's a type
19:20
of aircraft
19:21
so rockets are the fastest aircraft in
19:24
the world
19:25
remember i said before aircraft there
19:27
are many many different types of
19:29
aircraft
19:30
planes hang gliders and also rockets
19:34
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
19:36
section for this unit
19:38
let's take a short break we'll come back
19:40
and look at the reading don't go away
20:00
[Music]
20:01
you
