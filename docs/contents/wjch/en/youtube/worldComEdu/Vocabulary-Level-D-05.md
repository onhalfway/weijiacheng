hello kids
how are you today welcome back to
reading for vocabulary

you like sports
do you like to play sports or do you
like to watch
sports maybe you like to do both okay
well we're going to talk about sports in
this lesson
and we're going to be focusing on the
ancient
olympics so let's learn about the
history
of the olympics so you know about the
olympics right
the olympics where every country in the
world competes and there's television
and you can watch it on tv and you can
cheer
for your own nation of course that
happens every four
years but we're not talking about the
modern
olympics we're talking about the ancient
olympics in this lesson ancient means
a long long time ago
thousands of years ago before television
right
before many nations in the world
there was the ancient olympics and these
were held
in greece okay athletes athletes
from different cities in ancient greece
would get together and they would
compete
they would have a contest in many
different sports
where would they do it they would do it
under mount
olympus mount olympus is where the
greeks thought
the gods lived at the top of the
mountain
and the mountain was called olympus and
so they called it the olympic games
and like i said from many different
cities in greece
the athletes would come and compete and
of course
ancient greece is very famous right for
not only
many old buildings and many impressive
and beautiful
structures but also because of their
culture and their way of thinking
but they were the ones who created the
olympics in the beginning
thousands of years ago the ancient
olympics
so that's what we're going to read about
in this lesson
but before we do that let's learn some
vocabulary
okay and our first word is a
person who is very famous
of course you know many people who are
famous singers
actors on television actors in the movie
what do we call these people it starts
with a
c it is celebrity
celebrity is a person who is very
very famous and everybody knows who that
person is
okay what's the next word the next word
is a bird no it's not a bird it's a
thing
or idea that can represent another idea
the example is a bird the example
is a dove when people see a dove what do
they
think of they think of peace so the dove
is a symbol a symbol of
peace so if you can look at animals
you can look at flags the teguki the
korean flag
is a symbol for korea right so it's a
thing
or idea that can represent
another idea right so this thing here
the dove represents the idea of
peace okay next word
is very angry be careful joshua
right he looks like very very uh
dangerous dog
right strong and dangerous right joshua
hale
so what is the word that we use we use
it's not dog it's fierce okay
fierce now i have a dog a beagle
but she's not fierce she's very lovable
and cute
but this dog joshua right this dog is
very
fierce strong and dangerous
okay next one four no smoking
to let someone do something to let
someone do something
is to allow them to do something
but if you have a sign that says no
smoking
this would be not allow someone to do
something so the picture
and the word a little bit mismatched but
that's okay
because if we allow people to smoke
here then there's no sign right that
means we let them do something
if your mother lets you play video games
after dinner then she's allowing you to
do that
but do your homework first okay okay
next one
ah a race to be part of a race or
other competition what do we say
we say it is compete to be
part this is a verb right because you
are
part of a race or other competition if
you are in a race or another
competition it doesn't have to be a race
it could be a chess game
maybe a chess tournament or it could be
a soccer game
right it could be anything where you
compete compete is a verb you
it's like you're not really fighting
against somebody
but you're using your skill against
another person
to win you are competing okay
and of course compete is a verb and we
have competition
right competition is the noun and
competition is a game or any other
contest
where you use your skill to win
okay next one a feeling of doing well
so others can see a feeling of doing
well so others can see we say this is
pride right if he's on the football team
he's very young
football player he won right he has the
trophy his
team won the competition
so he has a lot of pride he
has pride but be careful he is
proud so pride is the noun
we can say um
he shows
his pride
in this case pride is a noun but
be careful we can also say he is
proud which is also very common but in
this case
proud is an adjective right this
is noun okay so he shows his pride
or he has pride next he is
proud adjective so be careful with the
word form
okay next more than normal
if something is more than normal what do
we say
we say especially especially
is kind of like when you want to point
out something
in particular some special case
right then we use especially
okay to go somewhere well
perhaps when you're older you can travel
around the world like this young girl is
doing here
she's traveling looks like she's in
france in paris
to go somewhere is to travel right
to travel you can travel around the
world
next one this is a sport where
athletes wear gloves and hit each other
you know this sport right you've seen
this before
these guys are being safe they're
wearing gloves and they're wearing a
padded
helmet right what are they doing right
they're doing this sport
it's not wrestling not wrestling it is
boxing boxing
now be careful boxing is a
noun it's the name of the sport
a few days ago i was in my neighborhood
and i saw a poster somebody opened a
boxing gym
and they wanted to be funny do you know
the movie shall we dance
well they used that idea for the movie
title
and on their on their poster they put
shall we boxing
and i thought what shall we boxing no it
should
be shall we
box because
box is a verb boxing
is a noun right the movie is not called
shall we dancing no shall we dance
shall we box okay because box is the
verb
so be careful again of the word form ing
is a noun boxing i like
boxing can you box okay
next word parts of a plant tied together
in a circle at christmas time we can see
these
many people put them on their doors they
hang them on their doors it's like happy
christmas or merry christmas right
we call it a wreath okay but it's not
just for christmas wreaths can be used
for other occasions but
most common people think of a wreath at
christmas time this is a christmas
wreath
but we'll see another kind of wreath in
the reading okay next one
oh don't look you muscle
a little baby right but usually babies
they don't wear any clothes
it's obviously of course when they're
first born they're not wearing clothes
right so what do we say they are naked
we come into this world
naked right we come into the world
naked and usually not so peaceful
but this baby is very peaceful very cute
right so not wearing any clothes
somebody is naked we'll see that in the
reading okay
next one being a girl or
woman not male so if we talk about you
know there's
there's about 50 of the people in the
world
are one sex or the other sex right
there's male
and then there's female female
right so male and female
basically everybody in the world is
either male or female
so about maybe a little more than half
of the people
in the world are female okay so being a
girl woman not male
next one of course this is korea
and you probably know where this is the
dmz right
an agreement that all fighting is
stopped
right it's just an agreement and maybe
the fighting has stopped for just a
short time
but there hasn't been a formal agreement
to stop it
forever right that's what korea is under
right now a truce
you know south korea and north korea
they never had a peace agreement
they're just under a truce technically
they're still at war right but they have
had a truce for
more than 60 years so a truce is just a
it's like a temporary stop to the
fighting
hopefully it will be permanent but a
truce and it's not just in korea
anywhere in the world where two groups
are fighting
and they say let's have a truce that
means a temporary
a short period where there's no fighting
okay
a flat piece of metal given as a prize
he's proud too
right he is proud he has pride because
why he has a medal
if you do something great whether in
school or
you in sports you win a game or you win
a tournament they might give you a medal
soldiers wear metals on their chest
right
so a metal is a small piece of metal
it's usually decorated looks nice
and it's given as a prize it shows
you were excellent in doing something
okay next one is to shout for something
good i talked about this before of
course it's to cheer
when i talked about the olympics i say
you cheer
for your country don't you of course
when you watch the olympics every four
years
you cheer for korea right uh deihan
minguk right you say
go korea right so you cheer for
your country or you cheer for your
team you shout you yell you go crazy
right okay next one a box that shows us
moving pictures
a box that shows it what what is that
i've
have you ever seen one of those before
what could that be
oh it's a television of course very
common i'm just kidding of course
everybody knows what a television is
it's like a box
well not anymore it used to be a box now
it's a very
thin screen right but it used to be like
a big box that was very heavy
but thankfully technology has moved on
so anyway television
you're watching a video screen right now
maybe you're watching this on television
you're probably watching it on your
computer screen but anyway television
is where you watch tv shows and movies
okay let's move on let's
go over the words the vocabulary
okay let's see how well you remember
these words choose the word that best
completes the sentence
we have words down here we have a blank
we need to complete the sentence
with these words let's take a look i
won't
be you to leave you haven't done your
homework
so mom says this when the boy or girl
wants to go out and play but mom says i
want
what you to leave you need to stay here
and finish your homework
you haven't done your homework you need
to stay here do your homework
and then you can leave then i will beep
you to leave
what i will give you to leave that
doesn't make sense
i will honor you to leave that doesn't
make sense
i will compete you to leave or i will
allow you to leave aha allow
sounds like it would be a good choice
right i won't
allow you to leave that's the answer i
won't
allow you to leave i won't let you leave
because you haven't done your homework
when you finish your homework
then i will allow you then you can go
then you are able to leave right i will
give you permission okay number two
there is a beep storm outside let's stay
in so you want to stay inside because
there's a storm outside
it's raining or it's snowing the wind is
blowing very strongly
it's very it could be dangerous strong
and dangerous
so what can we say there is a fierce
storm
fierce means dangerous right strong and
dangerous
right so there's a fierce storm outside
that sounds good let's check the others
there's a peaceful storm oh peaceful
it's very nice
why would we stay inside and have you
ever heard of a storm that is peaceful
that doesn't make sense there is a rude
storm
the wind's going by going yeah get out
of my way right
that's crazy okay so c doesn't work
d there's a slow storm outside let's
stay in
in that's a little bit eson hail the
best word
is fierce there's a fierce storm outside
let's stay in if there's a fierce storm
it means the wind is blowing really
strong it's very dangerous
okay so stay inside stay warm and stay
safe i was beep tired today
i only slept for four hours so
maybe you were playing video games late
last night no not video games
you were studying right you were
studying late last night
so you only slept for four hours
so if you if you only sleep for four
hours you're really tired right
so how do we what word means kind of
like
really or very does less no less doesn't
mean really or very
b slowly that doesn't make sense c
quickly i was quickly tired today
that's strange so d i was
especially aha especially means more
than normal
like very or really i was especially
tired today
i only slept for four hours so the
answer of course is especially
i was especially tired today
okay next one number four that flag is
the beep
of our nation i talked about this before
right when we saw the picture of the
dove but i
also gave you another example i said the
teguki
the korean flag is the beep of korea
just like the stars and stripes is the
beep for
america right a flag is a what a flag is
a symbol
of a nation so that flag is the symbol
of our nation
not the treat not the top not the
celebrity
but the symbol you see it and you think
of something else
it's the symbol of our nation okay next
one number five
i don't want to beep in the soccer game
maybe you feel sick or you're injured so
you don't want to play soccer right
you don't want to participate what word
means
play in a game or participate in a
contest
i don't want to forget in the soccer
game that doesn't make sense because we
don't use forget and in
i don't want to compete in the soccer
game compete
remember compete means to use your
skills
to try to win in a contest and that's
what they're doing
so compete is probably our word but
let's just check
i don't want to enjoy in the soccer game
that doesn't make sense because again we
don't say enjoy
in if in bego in begohamyan right if
in was gone right we could use i don't
want to forget the soccer game
i don't want to enjoy the soccer game
those would make sense
but because of in they don't make sense
i don't want to allow the soccer game
also if
in was not there then we could say yeah
it's possible i don't want to
allow the soccer game it's too noisy
for example i don't want to allow it but
because of
in because of in this one this one
this one and this one they don't make
sense the only one that makes sense is
compete
we compete in a game we compete
in a contest so that's a good thing to
remember
when you use the word compete use the
preposition
in i want to compete in the soccer game
i want to compete in the chess
tournament i want to compete in the
tennis championships you compete
in something okay number six
that singer is my favorite beep she is
so
famous right we talked about what do we
call
very famous people engineer no
well some engineers can be famous but
engineers aren't
normally famous right a veterinarian
no a veterinarian is just an animal
doctor not a famous person
c a celebrity aha that's the word we
talked about before
someone who's very very famous is a
celebrity
that's the answer right and d doctor
no because doctor is very similar to
veterinarian this one this one and this
one
are names of specific jobs
engineer builds buildings or make sure
things are working like machines and
things like that
veterinarian is a doctor who takes care
of animals and of course a doctor takes
care of people
they're just normal jobs but a celebrity
doesn't really mean a job it means a
person who is very famous
but it could be for anything singing
acting or for something
that they did that was bad right usually
celebrities are positive though
right somebody who's famous but we don't
know what they do for a
job they're just very famous okay next
one
number seven do you want to beep to
india with me
what word makes sense ask travel
enjoy compete do you want to compete to
india with me that sounds funny
actually the what's the best answer here
if you choose
be you're right do you want to travel to
india with me
because that means let's go to another
country or go
on a long journey do you want to travel
before i said
you can travel around the world be
careful don't say
trip right trip is a noun let's
take a trip take a
trip trip is a noun it's not a verb
right unless trip means you you hit your
foot on something
and you fall down then you trip but you
don't want to trip to india because
that's very painful
you want to travel to india that's the
verb
travel to india trip is a noun
okay take a trip to india but do you
want to travel
to india okay number eight you did very
well in school
your parents will be so what
if you do well in school your parents
how will they feel
will they feel calm angry
proud or bored
of course your parents will be proud
right you did very well in school your
parents will be so
proud they won't be angry that's crazy
right
they'll be very proud of you they'll say
that's my kid right
joe or sally did well in school i'm very
proud of my child okay okay well that
wraps it up for the vocabulary section

01:03
a long long time ago
01:06
thousands of years ago before television

before many nations in the world
01:13

01:17
were held
01:17
in greece okay athletes athletes
01:21
from different cities in ancient greece
01:25

ancient greece is very famous right for
01:59
not only
02:00
many old buildings and many impressive
02:04
and beautiful
02:06
structures but also because of their
02:08
culture and their way of thinking
02:10
but they were the ones who created the
02:12
olympics in the beginning
02:14
thousands of years ago the ancient
02:16
olympics
02:17
so that's what we're going to read about
02:19
in this lesson
02:21
but before we do that let's learn some
02:24
vocabulary
02:25
okay and our first word is a
02:28
person who is very famous
02:31
of course you know many people who are
02:34
famous singers
02:36
actors on television actors in the movie
02:39
what do we call these people it starts
02:42
with a
02:43
c it is celebrity
02:46
celebrity is a person who is very
02:50
very famous and everybody knows who that
02:53
person is
02:54
okay what's the next word the next word
02:57
is a bird no it's not a bird it's a
03:00
thing
03:00
or idea that can represent another idea
03:04
the example is a bird the example
03:07
is a dove when people see a dove what do
03:11
they
03:11
think of they think of peace so the dove
03:15
is a symbol a symbol of
03:19
peace so if you can look at animals
03:22
you can look at flags the teguki the
03:25
korean flag
03:27
is a symbol for korea right so it's a
03:30
thing
03:31
or idea that can represent
03:34
another idea right so this thing here
03:37
the dove represents the idea of
03:40
peace okay next word
03:44
is very angry be careful joshua
03:47
right he looks like very very uh
03:50
dangerous dog
03:51
right strong and dangerous right joshua
03:54
hale
03:54
so what is the word that we use we use
03:58
it's not dog it's fierce okay
04:02
fierce now i have a dog a beagle
04:05
but she's not fierce she's very lovable
04:08
and cute
04:09
but this dog joshua right this dog is
04:12
very
04:13
fierce strong and dangerous
04:16
okay next one four no smoking
04:20
to let someone do something to let
04:23
someone do something
04:24
is to allow them to do something
04:27
but if you have a sign that says no
04:29
smoking
04:30
this would be not allow someone to do
04:33
something so the picture
04:35
and the word a little bit mismatched but
04:37
that's okay
04:38
because if we allow people to smoke
04:42
here then there's no sign right that
04:45
means we let them do something
04:47
if your mother lets you play video games
04:50
after dinner then she's allowing you to
04:53
do that
04:54
but do your homework first okay okay
04:57
next one
04:58
ah a race to be part of a race or
05:01
other competition what do we say
05:04
we say it is compete to be
05:08
part this is a verb right because you
05:11
are
05:11
part of a race or other competition if
05:15
you are in a race or another
05:18
competition it doesn't have to be a race
05:21
it could be a chess game
05:23
maybe a chess tournament or it could be
05:25
a soccer game
05:27
right it could be anything where you
05:30
compete compete is a verb you
05:34
it's like you're not really fighting
05:36
against somebody
05:37
but you're using your skill against
05:40
another person
05:41
to win you are competing okay
05:44
and of course compete is a verb and we
05:46
have competition
05:48
right competition is the noun and
05:51
competition is a game or any other
05:53
contest
05:54
where you use your skill to win
05:57
okay next one a feeling of doing well
06:02
so others can see a feeling of doing
06:06
well so others can see we say this is
06:09
pride right if he's on the football team
06:12
he's very young
06:13
football player he won right he has the
06:16
trophy his
06:17
team won the competition
06:20
so he has a lot of pride he
06:24
has pride but be careful he is
06:27
proud so pride is the noun
06:31
we can say um
06:34
he shows
06:38
his pride
06:41
in this case pride is a noun but
06:45
be careful we can also say he is
06:48
proud which is also very common but in
06:50
this case
06:52
proud is an adjective right this
06:55
is noun okay so he shows his pride
06:59
or he has pride next he is
07:03
proud adjective so be careful with the
07:06
word form
07:07
okay next more than normal
07:11
if something is more than normal what do
07:13

08:24
and they wanted to be funny do you know
08:26
the movie shall we dance
08:29
well they used that idea for the movie
08:32
title
08:32
and on their on their poster they put
08:35
shall we boxing
08:36
and i thought what shall we boxing no it
08:39
should
08:40
be shall we
08:44
box because
08:47
box is a verb boxing
08:51
is a noun right the movie is not called
08:54
shall we dancing no shall we dance
08:58
shall we box okay because box is the
09:01
verb
09:02
so be careful again of the word form ing
09:05
is a noun boxing i like
09:08
boxing can you box okay
09:12
next word parts of a plant tied together
09:16
in a circle at christmas time we can see
09:19
these
09:20
many people put them on their doors they
09:23
hang them on their doors it's like happy
09:25
christmas or merry christmas right
09:27
we call it a wreath okay but it's not
09:31
just for christmas wreaths can be used
09:34
for other occasions but
09:36
most common people think of a wreath at
09:39
christmas time this is a christmas
09:42
wreath
09:43
but we'll see another kind of wreath in
09:45
the reading okay next one
09:47
oh don't look you muscle
09:54
a little baby right but usually babies
09:57
they don't wear any clothes
09:59
it's obviously of course when they're
10:01
first born they're not wearing clothes
10:03
right so what do we say they are naked
10:06
we come into this world
10:09
naked right we come into the world
10:12
naked and usually not so peaceful
10:16
but this baby is very peaceful very cute
10:19
right so not wearing any clothes
10:21
somebody is naked we'll see that in the
10:23
reading okay
10:24
next one being a girl or
10:27
woman not male so if we talk about you
10:31
know there's
10:31
there's about 50 of the people in the
10:34
world
10:35
are one sex or the other sex right
10:37
there's male
10:39
and then there's female female
10:42
right so male and female
10:46
basically everybody in the world is
10:47
either male or female
10:49
so about maybe a little more than half
10:52
of the people
10:53
in the world are female okay so being a
10:56
girl woman not male
10:58
next one of course this is korea
11:01
and you probably know where this is the
11:03
dmz right
11:04
an agreement that all fighting is
11:07
stopped
11:08
right it's just an agreement and maybe
11:09
the fighting has stopped for just a
11:11
short time
11:12
but there hasn't been a formal agreement
11:15
to stop it
11:16
forever right that's what korea is under
11:18
right now a truce
11:20
you know south korea and north korea
11:23
they never had a peace agreement
11:25
they're just under a truce technically
11:28
they're still at war right but they have
11:31
had a truce for
11:32
more than 60 years so a truce is just a
11:35
it's like a temporary stop to the
11:38
fighting
11:39
hopefully it will be permanent but a
11:42
truce and it's not just in korea
11:44
anywhere in the world where two groups
11:47
are fighting
11:48
and they say let's have a truce that
11:50
means a temporary
11:51
a short period where there's no fighting
11:54
okay
11:56
a flat piece of metal given as a prize
11:59
he's proud too
12:00
right he is proud he has pride because
12:03
why he has a medal
12:06
if you do something great whether in
12:09
school or
12:10
you in sports you win a game or you win
12:13
a tournament they might give you a medal
12:17
soldiers wear metals on their chest
12:20
right
12:20
so a metal is a small piece of metal
12:23
it's usually decorated looks nice
12:26
and it's given as a prize it shows
12:30
you were excellent in doing something
12:33
okay next one is to shout for something
12:37
good i talked about this before of
12:39
course it's to cheer
12:40
when i talked about the olympics i say
12:43
you cheer
12:44
for your country don't you of course
12:46
when you watch the olympics every four
12:48
years
12:49
you cheer for korea right uh deihan
12:52
minguk right you say
12:54
go korea right so you cheer for
12:57
your country or you cheer for your
13:00
team you shout you yell you go crazy
13:04
right okay next one a box that shows us
13:08
moving pictures
13:09
a box that shows it what what is that
13:12
i've
13:12
have you ever seen one of those before
13:14
what could that be
13:16
oh it's a television of course very
13:19
common i'm just kidding of course
13:21
everybody knows what a television is
13:23
it's like a box
13:24
well not anymore it used to be a box now
13:27
it's a very
13:28
thin screen right but it used to be like
13:30
a big box that was very heavy
13:32
but thankfully technology has moved on
13:35
so anyway television
13:37
you're watching a video screen right now
13:39
maybe you're watching this on television
13:41
you're probably watching it on your
13:43
computer screen but anyway television
13:45
is where you watch tv shows and movies
13:49
okay let's move on let's
13:52
go over the words the vocabulary
13:55
okay let's see how well you remember
13:57
these words choose the word that best
13:59
completes the sentence
14:00
we have words down here we have a blank
14:03
we need to complete the sentence
14:05
with these words let's take a look i
14:07
won't
14:08
be you to leave you haven't done your
14:11
homework
14:12
so mom says this when the boy or girl
14:16
wants to go out and play but mom says i
14:19
want
14:20
what you to leave you need to stay here
14:23
and finish your homework
14:25
you haven't done your homework you need
14:27
to stay here do your homework
14:29
and then you can leave then i will beep
14:32
you to leave
14:33
what i will give you to leave that
14:35
doesn't make sense
14:36
i will honor you to leave that doesn't
14:39
make sense
14:40
i will compete you to leave or i will
14:43
allow you to leave aha allow
14:47
sounds like it would be a good choice
14:49
right i won't
14:50
allow you to leave that's the answer i
14:53
won't
14:54
allow you to leave i won't let you leave
14:58
because you haven't done your homework
15:00
when you finish your homework
15:02
then i will allow you then you can go
15:05
then you are able to leave right i will
15:09
give you permission okay number two
15:12
there is a beep storm outside let's stay
15:15
in so you want to stay inside because
15:18
there's a storm outside
15:19
it's raining or it's snowing the wind is
15:22
blowing very strongly
15:25
it's very it could be dangerous strong
15:27
and dangerous
15:28
so what can we say there is a fierce
15:31
storm
15:32
fierce means dangerous right strong and
15:34
dangerous
15:35
right so there's a fierce storm outside
15:37
that sounds good let's check the others
15:39
there's a peaceful storm oh peaceful
15:42
it's very nice
15:43
why would we stay inside and have you
15:45
ever heard of a storm that is peaceful
15:47
that doesn't make sense there is a rude
15:50
storm
15:51
the wind's going by going yeah get out
15:53
of my way right
15:54
that's crazy okay so c doesn't work
15:57
d there's a slow storm outside let's
16:00
stay in
16:01
in that's a little bit eson hail the
16:03
best word
16:04
is fierce there's a fierce storm outside
16:08
let's stay in if there's a fierce storm
16:11
it means the wind is blowing really
16:13
strong it's very dangerous
16:15
okay so stay inside stay warm and stay
16:19
safe i was beep tired today
16:22
i only slept for four hours so
16:26
maybe you were playing video games late
16:28
last night no not video games
16:30
you were studying right you were
16:32
studying late last night
16:34
so you only slept for four hours
16:37
so if you if you only sleep for four
16:40
hours you're really tired right
16:42
so how do we what word means kind of
16:45
like
16:45
really or very does less no less doesn't
16:49
mean really or very
16:50
b slowly that doesn't make sense c
16:53
quickly i was quickly tired today
16:55
that's strange so d i was
16:58
especially aha especially means more
17:01
than normal
17:02
like very or really i was especially
17:05
tired today
17:07
i only slept for four hours so the
17:09
answer of course is especially
17:11
i was especially tired today
17:14
okay next one number four that flag is
17:17
the beep
17:18
of our nation i talked about this before
17:20
right when we saw the picture of the
17:22
dove but i
17:22
also gave you another example i said the
17:25
teguki
17:26
the korean flag is the beep of korea
17:30
just like the stars and stripes is the
17:32
beep for
17:33
america right a flag is a what a flag is
17:37
a symbol
17:38
of a nation so that flag is the symbol
17:41
of our nation
17:42
not the treat not the top not the
17:44
celebrity
17:45
but the symbol you see it and you think
17:48
of something else
17:49
it's the symbol of our nation okay next
17:52
one number five
17:53
i don't want to beep in the soccer game
17:56
maybe you feel sick or you're injured so
18:00
you don't want to play soccer right
18:02
you don't want to participate what word
18:06
means
18:06
play in a game or participate in a
18:09
contest
18:10
i don't want to forget in the soccer
18:13
game that doesn't make sense because we
18:14
don't use forget and in
18:16
i don't want to compete in the soccer
18:18
game compete
18:20
remember compete means to use your
18:23
skills
18:24
to try to win in a contest and that's
18:26
what they're doing
18:27
so compete is probably our word but
18:29
let's just check
18:31
i don't want to enjoy in the soccer game
18:34
that doesn't make sense because again we
18:36
don't say enjoy
18:38
in if in bego in begohamyan right if
18:42
in was gone right we could use i don't
18:45
want to forget the soccer game
18:47
i don't want to enjoy the soccer game
18:50
those would make sense
18:51
but because of in they don't make sense
18:54
i don't want to allow the soccer game
18:57
also if
18:58
in was not there then we could say yeah
19:01
it's possible i don't want to
19:03
allow the soccer game it's too noisy
19:06
for example i don't want to allow it but
19:08
because of
19:09
in because of in this one this one
19:14
this one and this one they don't make
19:16
sense the only one that makes sense is
19:18
compete
19:18
we compete in a game we compete
19:22
in a contest so that's a good thing to
19:25
remember
19:26
when you use the word compete use the
19:28
preposition
19:29
in i want to compete in the soccer game
19:32
i want to compete in the chess
19:35
tournament i want to compete in the
19:38
tennis championships you compete
19:42
in something okay number six
19:46
that singer is my favorite beep she is
19:48
so
19:49
famous right we talked about what do we
19:52
call
19:53
very famous people engineer no
19:57
well some engineers can be famous but
19:59
engineers aren't
20:00
normally famous right a veterinarian
20:04
no a veterinarian is just an animal
20:05
doctor not a famous person
20:07
c a celebrity aha that's the word we
20:11
talked about before
20:12
someone who's very very famous is a
20:15
celebrity
20:16
that's the answer right and d doctor
20:19
no because doctor is very similar to
20:21
veterinarian this one this one and this
20:24
one
20:24
are names of specific jobs
20:27
engineer builds buildings or make sure
20:31
things are working like machines and
20:34
things like that
20:34
veterinarian is a doctor who takes care
20:37
of animals and of course a doctor takes
20:39
care of people
20:40
they're just normal jobs but a celebrity
20:43
doesn't really mean a job it means a
20:45
person who is very famous
20:46
but it could be for anything singing
20:49
acting or for something
20:51
that they did that was bad right usually
20:54
celebrities are positive though
20:56
right somebody who's famous but we don't
20:58
know what they do for a
20:59
job they're just very famous okay next
21:02
