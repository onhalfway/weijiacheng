hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading i'm brian stewart
and today we're looking at social
studies book four
lesson five the federal government and
of course we're talking about the
federal government
of the united states in this lesson so
in this lesson you will discover the
parts of the u.s
federal government federal is like
national government we'll talk about
that
and what a constitution is a
constitution is very important
for a federal government okay let's get
started
the first word we have is congress
congress is the name for the group of
u.s
lawmakers here i must make a little
distinction though
congress is uh one branch of the
government
and it's made up of two bodies
congress is made up of the senate
which they call the upper or
upper part or it's more it's the more
formal the more
maybe a little bit more powerful part of
congress
and the other part the lower part is the
house
of sorry it's a long long
name rep
[Music]
house of representatives so congress
actually has two parts
there's the senate it's the upper
chamber and the lower chamber
is the house of representatives the
senate has fewer lawmakers
in it the house of representatives has
many hundreds
of members but it's the name for the
group of u.s lawmakers these
people make laws for the whole country
and as you can see it's a really big
group there's hundreds of people i don't
know
i don't think all of congress is in
there but quite a few people are in
there
and it looks like the state of the union
speech i think is what's going on
maybe it's hard to see in the picture
okay but anyway that's congress
okay legislative
legislative relates to making
and passing laws legislative
legislation
right legislation uh when
people make laws and they enforce laws
are they talk yeah they talk about laws
they make laws they pass laws
that's the legislative and when we talk
about
when we use this word we talk about it
to describe the part of government so
the legislative branch
of the government usually we use branch
because uh you know we'll talk about
this in this lesson i'm getting ahead of
myself
but there are three branches to the u.s
government the united states government
there's the legislative
branch that's one branch we'll talk
about the other branches
next but it's like a tree right three
different branches
and they're all equal they should be
equal in power that's how you make sure
that one person or one group doesn't
take all the power
and rule the country like a tyranny or a
dictatorship we don't want that
so uh hopefully we have three different
branches of government
to spread the power out among many
different people
okay next executive now executive
is another branch of the government so
we have
legislative is one branch a legislative
executive is the next branch so
executive
relating to managing a group or
organization
and of course at a company right you
talk about the leaders of a company we
call them executives
because they are the top managers of a
group
or organization so the ceo is the chief
executive officer at a company
they're the ones that are the top
manager
at that company organization in this
case we see a picture of president
obama he is the executive he is the
leader
of the executive branch of government
he's the leader of the united states
he manages his job is to manage
the united states okay but he doesn't
have all the power which is good
okay next white house white house
we would say the white house the is the
place where the president
of the united states lives and works
so east wing west wing and of course
when you talk about east wing west wing
we talk about the different parts
of a of a big house they call them wings
like a big mansion
will have different wings so the east
wing
is where the president has his office
and all the people that work on his or
her staff
have offices in the east wing of the
white house
the west wing is where the president and
his or her family
lives and that's where the kitchen is
and you know the living facilities
are on the other side so the president
doesn't have to drive to work every
morning he doesn't have to waste time he
just walks from the west wing
to the east wing of the same house and
he's at work
okay of course presidents usually travel
a lot anyway
but you want to make it convenient you
don't want them to waste time in
commuting
they can just get to work right away
it's a very busy and important job
of course to be the president next we
have
supreme court the supreme court and the
supreme court is the highest
court in the united states that's a
different that's the third branch of
government
it's the judicial branch judicial
branch so we've covered all three
branches
the legislative branch the executive
branch
and the judicial branch what is the
judicial branch
judicial relates to court judge or
system of law basically the legislative
branch
makes the law the judicial branch i
think it was over here
judicial branch enforces the law or
interprets the law right and applies the
law
for various cases so if somebody has a
problem
with the law they they either have a
court case they have a lawsuit or
they're in trouble they broke the law
then the judicial branch their job is to
look at the case
and determine what the law how the law
should be applied in that case
so they're more like enforcing and
interpreting
the law okay so three branches of the
government
and of course branch as i said before
you know getting ahead of myself
branch you have different branches so we
have the legislative branch we talked
about that
we have the executive branch and we have
the judicial branch
and these branches make up the federal
government
it's a branch of course is a part of a
large organization think of a
tree right that has three different
branches they all come out
from the same tree and they should in
this case in the federal government they
should all be equal
they should have uh you know different
powers of course
you know one branch might be a little
stronger than the other depending on
who the people are in in the branch who
is working in it
but this is a safety
system it's a way to spread power among
different
people so that not like i said not one
person or one group can take all the
power you don't want that
in a democratic society or really any
society really
so branch is a part of a large
organization
okay so those are our words for this
lesson
now first main idea of course three
parts of the u.s federal government
i've already talked about these in the
vocabulary get ahead of myself
so let's talk about the one on the top
here executive branch
the executive branch that is represented
by the white house because that's where
the president lives
and works the president of the u.s
lives and works in the white house the
president signs
laws okay so the president will sign a
law
that's a that's a very important power
that the president has
because the legislative branch the
capital
there in the capital and the capital
building
that houses congress
the lawmakers in congress they make the
laws they make the laws
excuse me they work in the capital and
by the way the capitol building
is a very famous white domed building
it's in washington dc it's near the
white house
but that's where all the lawmakers meet
of course it's a very large building
because you have hundreds of people
working there they make the law and then
they send the law to the present
the president will sign it now sometimes
this president doesn't
sign it in that case the president will
veto
that means he doesn't sign the bill and
the
if he doesn't sign the bill the bill
will not be passed
of course the legislative branch can
overrule if they have enough votes
they can overrule the president they can
get the bill passed without him
or her but uh usually um
they they don't have that type of
majority and it's very important the
president can
veto or sign the bill until of course
the president
will instruct congress or try to get
congress to
to make laws so that he can sign them
into law
so it's you know they're sharing the
power that way now after the law is made
the law is passed
and it's the law of the land it falls to
the judicial branch
to enforce that law and to also
to tell us if the law is fair the the
body that does that is the supreme court
now of course there's not just one judge
in america there are nine judges
again this very important this is a very
important part in the government
we don't want to let it just leave it to
just one individual
it should be nine why nine because if
you have
eight you could have four
voting for and four voting against and
that's a tie
but if you have nine people you can't
have a tie
so this is a good system to make sure
that you know if a
law is very controversial and some
people support it
and some people oppose it you still have
a clear majority five
to four right so you'll never have the
situation where it's four to four
and then you know that's that's a big
mess how do we resolve that situation no
we can never have that situation it's
either five it's always five to four
or you know it could be unanimous all
all of them
uh decide the same way but anyway that's
why there are nine
judges in the supreme court they tell us
if the laws are fair
and that's an important point if
congress makes a law and the president
signs it signs it it becomes law
but the judicial branch might look at
that law and say no that law is not fair
it's unconstitutional and they will
strike it down
and that law will be gone so this is the
way that the three branches of
government
share power okay
the second idea is that the government
is divided into three parts
because of the constitution remember i
just mentioned the constitution
uh when the supreme court decides the
law is unconstitutional
so what is a constitution the
constitution
is the plan for a democratic government
the constitution and it's very famous we
the people
starts off the united states
constitution actually the united states
was the first country to make a
constitution
and to become a democracy they broke
with the old european model
of kings and queens and things like that
so
they created the first democratic
government they had the first model of a
constitution
and basically a constitution in a
democratic country
it tells how the government is organized
you know what are the branches of
government not
every country might not might have three
branches
you know they don't have to follow the
same most countries do follow that same
model but they don't have to you know a
country could make a constitution with
only two branches of government
so a constitution is just basically a
plan it tells the country
how the government is set up and how it
should be run and the constitution
also contains basic rights that apply to
all citizens of that country and those
laws
cannot be you can't make a law that
contradicts
the laws in the constitution you can
change the constitution
and the u.s constitution has been
changed several times we call those
amendments i don't want to get too much
into this
but anyway the supreme court will will
will look at a law
and say does it agree with the
constitution if it doesn't
they'll say that law is unconstitutional
and strike
that law down so but the constitution
also divides the three parts
of the government in the u.s
constitution okay
so that's that's actually a much bigger
lesson we could get into here but anyway
that's just a basic
overview of the u.s federal government
oh by the way
federal government federal means for the
whole
nation okay the united states is also of
course divided into different states
and each state we talked about that in a
previous lesson we talked about local
government
each state has its own government and
then each county has their own
government and cities might have their
own government
but all of these governments must agree
with the federal government they cannot
pass laws that disagree with
federal laws of course they have the
right and the the
responsibility to manage laws in their
small area
but these laws cannot contradict the
federal government laws
which are outlined in the constitution
so that's the difference between
federal government and local government
state county
and city government so we're talking
about the national government when we
talk about
the federal government okay
let's do the reading now when i read
please repeat after me practice
pronunciation
also focus on the words from the
vocabulary you guys ready
here we go the government of the united
states
works for all its citizens
the federal government is made up of
three different
parts because the u.s constitution
describes a government in three
branches the three branches
are legislative executive
and judicial congress
as a part of the legislative branch
has an important role to play in making
society's laws
the president is the head of the
executive
branch and should sign each law
before it is carried out he
or she lives in the white house
in washington d.c
the supreme court is the most important
part of the judicial branch
and only the best judges are allowed
to work there okay
the legislative executive
and judicial branches of the government
help make the u.s a safer
and happier place to live in
it's safer because not only one person
or one group can take all the power
and tell everybody what they want them
to do right
it's supposed to be fair and equal
that's the hallmark of the american
system
everybody is equal under the law or
should be that's the ideal
okay so anyway that's the reading
passage let's take a look at how this
information was organized
here we have classify this is a perfect
example or a perfect
type of subject to use classify because
we have three branches of the government
we can classify each branch and then
describe
each branch what they do and what
they're composed of
so first again we talked about the
legislative branch that's the first
classification or first grouping the
legislative branch
beep makes the society's laws so what is
the legislative branch remember i talked
about it
it's it's the body we call it uh
congress
so congress
oops two s's on congress congress makes
the society's laws they are the group of
people
hundreds of people representatives from
all the states
in the united states 50 states so that's
a lot of people okay
you have many representatives from each
state either the house of
representatives
or in the senate oh by the way i don't
want to get too much but each state has
two senators right and then the states
may have
many house many representatives so but
there's only two senators from each
state
okay good executive branch is the next
classification
the president is the head of it the
president should
beep each law what do we talk about
right congress
makes the law they send the law or the
bill it's not a law yet
it's a bill they send it to the
president the president signs it
it becomes law i just said it should
sign
each law if he doesn't sign it it
doesn't become law it goes back to
congress
and they have to get a lot of votes a
huge majority of votes to overrule the
president
otherwise it doesn't become a law
judicial branch what peep
is the most important part of it the
beep is the most important part of the
judicial branch remember there are nine
judges on it
it is the supreme court
the supreme supreme means top
the best the the best just the
the the best the supreme court
okay so it's the best court in the line
and that's interesting because we say
the supreme court
it's the top court it's the best court
in the land there are other courts
there are district courts right the
federal
uh district court there are state courts
there are local courts there's many
different
uh levels of courts and
that's interesting because you know the
top level is the pre is the supreme
court
their decision is final if a lower court
makes a decision and one of the two
parties don't like it
they possibly could appeal
and go to a higher court now if it's a
constitutional issue
they haven't they have a chance to be
heard at the supreme court because the
supreme court decides
on constitutional matters of course if
you have a traffic ticket
you're never going to go to the supreme
court right if you if you complain about
your traffic ticket
but if it's a if it's a a situation that
involves
uh race or or discrimination
or uh the right to speak publicly
these are constitutional issues and they
might be kicked up to the supreme court
but the supreme court has the final
decision
and they are experts in constitutional
law that's their job
to determine whether a law is fair or
not
okay so those are the three branches of
the us government
think about the country in which you
live what type or what different
branches
do you have in government do you call it
congress do you call it parliament
how many people are there how is it
organized this is interesting when
thinking about your own country
how is your federal government organized
and
you can compare and contrast and also
think about you know
what are the good points or bad points
when you compare it to
other governments of other countries
hopefully you live in a democratic
country
and things are fair and equal for
everyone
in your country or should be fair and
equal for everyone in your country
that's the ideal so anyway that's our
lesson
for uh today and uh thank you for
studying with me as always
hope you learned a lot of good words and
something to think about
okay we'll see in the next lesson take
care everybody bye bye
you

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:11
textbook reading i'm brian stewart
00:13
and today we're looking at social
00:14
studies book four
00:16
lesson five the federal government and
00:19
of course we're talking about the
00:20
federal government
00:21
of the united states in this lesson so
00:25
in this lesson you will discover the
00:26
parts of the u.s
00:28
federal government federal is like
00:30
national government we'll talk about
00:32
that
00:33
and what a constitution is a
00:36
constitution is very important
00:38
for a federal government okay let's get
00:42
started
00:45
the first word we have is congress
00:48
congress is the name for the group of
00:51
u.s
00:52
lawmakers here i must make a little
00:55
distinction though
00:56
congress is uh one branch of the
00:59
government
00:59
and it's made up of two bodies
01:02
congress is made up of the senate
01:06
which they call the upper or
01:09
upper part or it's more it's the more
01:10
formal the more
01:12
maybe a little bit more powerful part of
01:14
congress
01:15
and the other part the lower part is the
01:18
house
01:20
of sorry it's a long long
01:23
name rep
01:25
[Music]
01:31
house of representatives so congress
01:33
actually has two parts
01:35
there's the senate it's the upper
01:36
chamber and the lower chamber
01:39
is the house of representatives the
01:40
senate has fewer lawmakers
01:43
in it the house of representatives has
01:45
many hundreds
01:47
of members but it's the name for the
01:50
group of u.s lawmakers these
01:54
people make laws for the whole country
01:57
and as you can see it's a really big
01:59
group there's hundreds of people i don't
02:01
know
02:01
i don't think all of congress is in
02:03
there but quite a few people are in
02:04
there
02:05
and it looks like the state of the union
02:07
speech i think is what's going on
02:09
maybe it's hard to see in the picture
02:11
okay but anyway that's congress
02:12
okay legislative
02:17
legislative relates to making
02:20
and passing laws legislative
02:25
legislation
02:27
right legislation uh when
02:30
people make laws and they enforce laws
02:33
are they talk yeah they talk about laws
02:35
they make laws they pass laws
02:37
that's the legislative and when we talk
02:39
about
02:40
when we use this word we talk about it
02:42
to describe the part of government so
02:44
the legislative branch
02:47
of the government usually we use branch
02:49
because uh you know we'll talk about
02:51
this in this lesson i'm getting ahead of
02:53
myself
02:54
but there are three branches to the u.s
02:57
government the united states government
02:59
there's the legislative
03:01
branch that's one branch we'll talk
03:03
about the other branches
03:04
next but it's like a tree right three
03:06
different branches
03:07
and they're all equal they should be
03:09
equal in power that's how you make sure
03:12
that one person or one group doesn't
03:14
take all the power
03:16
and rule the country like a tyranny or a
03:18
dictatorship we don't want that
03:21
so uh hopefully we have three different
03:23
branches of government
03:24
to spread the power out among many
03:27
different people
03:28
okay next executive now executive
03:32
is another branch of the government so
03:35
we have
03:36
legislative is one branch a legislative
03:39
executive is the next branch so
03:42
executive
03:43
relating to managing a group or
03:46
organization
03:47
and of course at a company right you
03:49
talk about the leaders of a company we
03:51
call them executives
03:53
because they are the top managers of a
03:56
group
03:56
or organization so the ceo is the chief
04:00
executive officer at a company
04:03
they're the ones that are the top
04:05
manager
04:06
at that company organization in this
04:09
case we see a picture of president
04:10
obama he is the executive he is the
04:13
leader
04:15
of the executive branch of government
04:17
he's the leader of the united states
04:19
he manages his job is to manage
04:22
the united states okay but he doesn't
04:24
have all the power which is good
04:26
okay next white house white house
04:30
we would say the white house the is the
04:32
place where the president
04:34
of the united states lives and works
04:37
so east wing west wing and of course
04:40
when you talk about east wing west wing
04:41
we talk about the different parts
04:43
of a of a big house they call them wings
04:45
like a big mansion
04:46
will have different wings so the east
04:49
wing
04:49
is where the president has his office
04:53
and all the people that work on his or
04:56
her staff
04:58
have offices in the east wing of the
05:01
white house
05:01
the west wing is where the president and
05:04
his or her family
05:06
lives and that's where the kitchen is
05:07
and you know the living facilities
05:09
are on the other side so the president
05:11
doesn't have to drive to work every
05:12
morning he doesn't have to waste time he
05:14
just walks from the west wing
05:16
to the east wing of the same house and
05:19
he's at work
05:20
okay of course presidents usually travel
05:22
a lot anyway
05:23
but you want to make it convenient you
05:24
don't want them to waste time in
05:26
commuting
05:27
they can just get to work right away
05:29
it's a very busy and important job
05:31
of course to be the president next we
05:34
have
05:35
supreme court the supreme court and the
05:38
supreme court is the highest
05:40
court in the united states that's a
05:43
different that's the third branch of
05:45
government
05:46
it's the judicial branch judicial
05:50
branch so we've covered all three
05:52
branches
05:53
the legislative branch the executive
05:56
branch
05:56
and the judicial branch what is the
05:59
judicial branch
06:00
judicial relates to court judge or
06:03
system of law basically the legislative
06:07
branch
06:07
makes the law the judicial branch i
06:10
think it was over here
06:11
judicial branch enforces the law or
06:15
interprets the law right and applies the
06:18
law
06:18
for various cases so if somebody has a
06:21
problem
06:22
with the law they they either have a
06:25
court case they have a lawsuit or
06:26
they're in trouble they broke the law
06:28
then the judicial branch their job is to
06:31
look at the case
06:32
and determine what the law how the law
06:35
should be applied in that case
06:37
so they're more like enforcing and
06:39
interpreting
06:40
the law okay so three branches of the
06:43
government
06:45
and of course branch as i said before
06:48
you know getting ahead of myself
06:50
branch you have different branches so we
06:52
have the legislative branch we talked
06:54
about that
06:54
we have the executive branch and we have
06:57
the judicial branch
06:58
and these branches make up the federal
07:01
government
07:02
it's a branch of course is a part of a
07:04
large organization think of a
07:06
tree right that has three different
07:08
branches they all come out
07:10
from the same tree and they should in
07:13
this case in the federal government they
07:14
should all be equal
07:16
they should have uh you know different
07:18
powers of course
07:19
you know one branch might be a little
07:20
stronger than the other depending on
07:22
who the people are in in the branch who
07:26
is working in it
07:26
but this is a safety
07:30
system it's a way to spread power among
07:33
different
07:34
people so that not like i said not one
07:37
person or one group can take all the
07:38
power you don't want that
07:40
in a democratic society or really any
07:43
society really
07:44
so branch is a part of a large
07:47
organization
07:48
okay so those are our words for this
07:50
lesson
07:52
now first main idea of course three
07:55
parts of the u.s federal government
07:56
i've already talked about these in the
07:58
vocabulary get ahead of myself
08:00
so let's talk about the one on the top
08:02
here executive branch
08:04
the executive branch that is represented
08:06
by the white house because that's where
08:08
the president lives
08:09
and works the president of the u.s
08:12
lives and works in the white house the
08:13
president signs
08:15
laws okay so the president will sign a
08:18
law
08:19
that's a that's a very important power
08:21
that the president has
08:23
because the legislative branch the
08:26
capital
08:26
there in the capital and the capital
08:29
building
08:30
that houses congress
08:33
the lawmakers in congress they make the
08:35
laws they make the laws
08:37
excuse me they work in the capital and
08:38
by the way the capitol building
08:41
is a very famous white domed building
08:43
it's in washington dc it's near the
08:45
white house
08:46
but that's where all the lawmakers meet
08:49
of course it's a very large building
08:51
because you have hundreds of people
08:52
working there they make the law and then
08:55
they send the law to the present
08:57
the president will sign it now sometimes
08:59
this president doesn't
09:00
sign it in that case the president will
09:02
veto
09:03
that means he doesn't sign the bill and
09:06
the
09:06
if he doesn't sign the bill the bill
09:08
will not be passed
09:10
of course the legislative branch can
09:12
overrule if they have enough votes
09:14
they can overrule the president they can
09:16
get the bill passed without him
09:18
or her but uh usually um
09:22
they they don't have that type of
09:24
majority and it's very important the
09:26
president can
09:27
veto or sign the bill until of course
09:29
the president
09:30
will instruct congress or try to get
09:32
congress to
09:33
to make laws so that he can sign them
09:36
into law
09:38
so it's you know they're sharing the
09:39
power that way now after the law is made
09:42
the law is passed
09:43
and it's the law of the land it falls to
09:46
the judicial branch
09:48
to enforce that law and to also
09:51
to tell us if the law is fair the the
09:55
body that does that is the supreme court
09:57
now of course there's not just one judge
09:59
in america there are nine judges
10:02
again this very important this is a very
10:06
important part in the government
10:08
we don't want to let it just leave it to
10:10
just one individual
10:11
it should be nine why nine because if
10:14
you have
10:15
eight you could have four
10:18
voting for and four voting against and
10:22
that's a tie
10:23
but if you have nine people you can't
10:25
have a tie
10:26
so this is a good system to make sure
10:28
that you know if a
10:30
law is very controversial and some
10:32
people support it
10:33
and some people oppose it you still have
10:36
a clear majority five
10:40
to four right so you'll never have the
10:42
situation where it's four to four
10:44
and then you know that's that's a big
10:46
mess how do we resolve that situation no
10:48
we can never have that situation it's
10:50
either five it's always five to four
10:52
or you know it could be unanimous all
10:55
all of them
10:55
uh decide the same way but anyway that's
10:58
why there are nine
10:59
judges in the supreme court they tell us
11:01
if the laws are fair
11:02
and that's an important point if
11:05
congress makes a law and the president
11:07
signs it signs it it becomes law
11:10
but the judicial branch might look at
11:12
that law and say no that law is not fair
11:15
it's unconstitutional and they will
11:17
strike it down
11:19
and that law will be gone so this is the
11:22
way that the three branches of
11:23
government
11:24
share power okay
11:28
the second idea is that the government
11:30
is divided into three parts
11:31
because of the constitution remember i
11:33
just mentioned the constitution
11:35
uh when the supreme court decides the
11:36
law is unconstitutional
11:39
so what is a constitution the
11:41
constitution
11:42
is the plan for a democratic government
11:46
the constitution and it's very famous we
11:48
the people
11:49
starts off the united states
11:51
constitution actually the united states
11:53
was the first country to make a
11:54
constitution
11:55
and to become a democracy they broke
11:58
with the old european model
12:00
of kings and queens and things like that
12:03
so
12:04
they created the first democratic
12:05
government they had the first model of a
12:07
constitution
12:09
and basically a constitution in a
12:11
democratic country
12:13
it tells how the government is organized
12:16
you know what are the branches of
12:17
government not
12:17
every country might not might have three
12:20
branches
12:20
you know they don't have to follow the
12:22
same most countries do follow that same
12:24
model but they don't have to you know a
12:26
country could make a constitution with
12:28
only two branches of government
12:29
so a constitution is just basically a
12:31
plan it tells the country
12:34
how the government is set up and how it
12:36
should be run and the constitution
12:38
also contains basic rights that apply to
12:41
all citizens of that country and those
12:44
laws
12:45
cannot be you can't make a law that
12:48
contradicts
12:49
the laws in the constitution you can
12:52
change the constitution
12:53
and the u.s constitution has been
12:55
changed several times we call those
12:57
amendments i don't want to get too much
13:00
into this
13:01
but anyway the supreme court will will
13:04
will look at a law
13:05
and say does it agree with the
13:06
constitution if it doesn't
13:08
they'll say that law is unconstitutional
13:10
and strike
13:11
that law down so but the constitution
13:15
also divides the three parts
13:19
of the government in the u.s
13:20
constitution okay
13:22
so that's that's actually a much bigger
13:25
lesson we could get into here but anyway
13:27
that's just a basic
13:28
overview of the u.s federal government
13:30
oh by the way
13:31
federal government federal means for the
13:34
whole
13:35
nation okay the united states is also of
13:37
course divided into different states
13:39
and each state we talked about that in a
13:41
previous lesson we talked about local
13:43
government
13:43
each state has its own government and
13:46
then each county has their own
13:47
government and cities might have their
13:49
own government
13:50
but all of these governments must agree
13:53
with the federal government they cannot
13:55
pass laws that disagree with
13:58
federal laws of course they have the
13:59
right and the the
14:01
responsibility to manage laws in their
14:04
small area
14:05
but these laws cannot contradict the
14:07
federal government laws
14:09
which are outlined in the constitution
14:11
so that's the difference between
14:12
federal government and local government
14:14
state county
14:16
and city government so we're talking
14:17
about the national government when we
14:19
talk about
14:19
the federal government okay
14:22
let's do the reading now when i read
14:26
please repeat after me practice
14:28
pronunciation
14:29
also focus on the words from the
14:31
vocabulary you guys ready
14:33
here we go the government of the united
14:37
states
14:37
works for all its citizens
14:41
the federal government is made up of
14:43
three different
14:44
parts because the u.s constitution
14:48
describes a government in three
14:51
branches the three branches
14:55
are legislative executive
14:58
and judicial congress
15:01
as a part of the legislative branch
15:04
has an important role to play in making
15:08
society's laws
15:12
the president is the head of the
15:15
executive
15:16
branch and should sign each law
15:19
before it is carried out he
15:22
or she lives in the white house
15:26
in washington d.c
15:30
the supreme court is the most important
15:34
part of the judicial branch
15:37
and only the best judges are allowed
15:41
to work there okay
15:44
the legislative executive
15:47
and judicial branches of the government
15:51
help make the u.s a safer
15:54
and happier place to live in
15:57
it's safer because not only one person
16:00
or one group can take all the power
16:02
and tell everybody what they want them
16:04
to do right
16:05
it's supposed to be fair and equal
16:08
that's the hallmark of the american
16:10
system
16:10
everybody is equal under the law or
16:13
should be that's the ideal
16:14
okay so anyway that's the reading
16:16
passage let's take a look at how this
16:18
information was organized
16:22
here we have classify this is a perfect
16:24
example or a perfect
16:26
type of subject to use classify because
16:29
we have three branches of the government
16:31
we can classify each branch and then
16:34
describe
16:35
each branch what they do and what
16:37
they're composed of
16:38
so first again we talked about the
16:40
legislative branch that's the first
16:42
classification or first grouping the
16:44
legislative branch
16:46
beep makes the society's laws so what is
16:50
the legislative branch remember i talked
16:51
about it
16:52
it's it's the body we call it uh
16:55
congress
16:56
so congress
17:00
oops two s's on congress congress makes
17:03
the society's laws they are the group of
17:05
people
17:06
hundreds of people representatives from
17:08
all the states
17:09
in the united states 50 states so that's
17:11
a lot of people okay
17:13
you have many representatives from each
17:15
state either the house of
17:16
representatives
17:17
or in the senate oh by the way i don't
17:19
want to get too much but each state has
17:21
two senators right and then the states
17:23
may have
17:24
many house many representatives so but
17:27
there's only two senators from each
17:29
state
17:30
okay good executive branch is the next
17:33
classification
17:34
the president is the head of it the
17:37
president should
17:38
beep each law what do we talk about
17:40
right congress
17:41
makes the law they send the law or the
17:43
bill it's not a law yet
17:45
it's a bill they send it to the
17:47
president the president signs it
17:49
it becomes law i just said it should
17:52
sign
17:54
each law if he doesn't sign it it
17:56
doesn't become law it goes back to
17:58
congress
17:59
and they have to get a lot of votes a
18:00
huge majority of votes to overrule the
18:03
president
18:03
otherwise it doesn't become a law
18:07
judicial branch what peep
18:10
is the most important part of it the
18:12
beep is the most important part of the
18:13
judicial branch remember there are nine
18:15
judges on it
18:17
it is the supreme court
18:20
the supreme supreme means top
18:23
the best the the best just the
18:26
the the best the supreme court
18:30
okay so it's the best court in the line
18:32
and that's interesting because we say
18:34
the supreme court
18:35
it's the top court it's the best court
18:37
in the land there are other courts
18:40
there are district courts right the
18:42
federal
18:43
uh district court there are state courts
18:46
there are local courts there's many
18:47
different
18:48
uh levels of courts and
18:51
that's interesting because you know the
18:53
top level is the pre is the supreme
18:55
court
18:55
their decision is final if a lower court
18:58
makes a decision and one of the two
19:00
parties don't like it
19:02
they possibly could appeal
19:05
and go to a higher court now if it's a
19:07
constitutional issue
19:09
they haven't they have a chance to be
19:12
heard at the supreme court because the
19:14
supreme court decides
19:15
on constitutional matters of course if
19:18
you have a traffic ticket
19:20
you're never going to go to the supreme
19:21
court right if you if you complain about
19:23
your traffic ticket
19:24
but if it's a if it's a a situation that
19:27
involves
19:28
uh race or or discrimination
19:31
or uh the right to speak publicly
19:34
these are constitutional issues and they
19:38
might be kicked up to the supreme court
19:41
but the supreme court has the final
19:43
decision
19:44
and they are experts in constitutional
19:46
law that's their job
19:47
to determine whether a law is fair or
19:50
not
19:50
okay so those are the three branches of
19:53
the us government
19:54
think about the country in which you
19:55
live what type or what different
19:57
branches
19:58
do you have in government do you call it
20:00
congress do you call it parliament
20:02
how many people are there how is it
20:03
organized this is interesting when
20:05
thinking about your own country
20:07
how is your federal government organized
20:10
and
20:10
you can compare and contrast and also
20:12
think about you know
20:14
what are the good points or bad points
20:17
when you compare it to
20:18
other governments of other countries
20:21
hopefully you live in a democratic
20:22
country
20:23
and things are fair and equal for
20:26
everyone
20:26
in your country or should be fair and
20:29
equal for everyone in your country
20:31
that's the ideal so anyway that's our
20:33
lesson
20:34
for uh today and uh thank you for
20:36
studying with me as always
20:38
hope you learned a lot of good words and
20:40
something to think about
20:41
okay we'll see in the next lesson take
20:43
care everybody bye bye
20:51
you
