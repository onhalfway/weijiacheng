hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading my name is brian
stewart
and in this lesson we're going over
science book 4
lesson 13 work
is that a good lesson topic i don't know
but don't worry
we don't have to work during this lesson
we can
learn about work and we can learn about
physical work
is the subject of this lesson for
example you will discover
how to make work easier great
and also what are some simple machines
okay so let's begin
the first word in our vocabulary section
is
pulley pulley what's a pulley well a
pulley is a device
when people say it's a device it's it
you know it's like a simple machine
or it's a some kind of tool that you can
use
to perform some action so a pulley is a
device
with a wheel and the wheel is here you
can see the wheel is here
and a rope and you see the rope sticking
up here right
for lifting heavy objects so it's a
device to help you
lift heavy objects right if this is an
object
that you want to lift up and maybe move
somewhere else you can tie a rope to it
maybe tie another weight over
here and then you can use the wheel to
pull it up
and then you can swing this part and
then that
makes it a crane you swing it over and
then you can lower it down to where you
want it
and that's what a pulley is basically a
pulley is useful for
for lifting heavy objects it makes it
easier to move them around
okay next we have lift and i just said
that lift
a pulley makes it easier to lift heavy
objects so lift here
is a verb right and it means to to do
something to do what
to move something from a lower position
to a higher position so if you have
something down here
and you lift it up here you're moving it
from a lower position
to a higher position so from a lower
position
to a higher position and of course it
looks like this
is on a crane c-r-a-n-e
which is u attached to a pulley on the
crane then they're lifting it up
okay wheel
we saw a wheel before on the pulley but
a wheel of course is also
on a wagon or on a car it's a round
object
the shape of it is round and it's a
round object on a vehicle
but it can also be on a pulley as we
just saw which
lets it move on the ground of course on
a vehicle
the wheel lets it move on the ground
because the wheel can turn easily it's
round it's very easy
to turn this way or the other way
depending on which way you're going
but it's very easy to turn it and as it
turns it moves
across the ground so wheels were a great
invention
many thousands of years ago because they
helped
people a long long long long time ago
do their work more easily right they
needed to move something from here
to there hey if you use wheels on
whatever you're using to move
it's a lot easier to move it so wheel
was a great invention
wagon now wagon in this wagon here
you know there's many different kinds of
wagon this is a wagon that the pioneers
use to move across the united states
and in other countries as well but a
wagon of course is a vehicle with
four wheels usually pulled by horses
usually not always because these are not
horses
horses don't have those big horns
sticking out of them
out of their heads so usually horses are
are used to pull wagons but
you know many different animals uh
animal power was very important of
course before the invention
of the machine and different types of
animals were used
for their power for their pulling power
in this case we have um
a couple of ox uh oxen
uh and of course horses are also used as
well actually looking at this picture a
little bit more
i'm seeing that the ox they're not real
okay i was like wait a minute it's that
ox back is very shiny
it's not it's not a real ox okay so but
anyway
the what we're looking at is a wagon and
we see the wheels are here
and of course there's four you can't see
the fourth wheel but
a wagon is very useful of course for
putting stuff in the wagon
and then moving it from one place to
another makes work
easier next we have a lever
a lever is another thing that helps make
work
easier because you can use a lever to
move a heavy object a famous scientist
once said
give me a lever long enough and i can
move the earth of course you'd need
you need a lot more other equipment to
be able to do that but basically what he
was saying is that lovers his point was
that levers
are very powerful and if you have a
lever that's long enough and strong
enough
you can move very heavy objects objects
that you think
that are not uh that are impossible to
lift so
a lever is a long object used to move an
object upward of course you need a lever
this this
piece of board is acting as a lever but
you also need
this to put the lever on you need some
point
to get leverage to be able to put it on
there and of course this has to be
strong enough to support the weight
of whatever it is that you want to move
up
what does this look like by the way it
looks like a seesaw right
so you use a lever when you go to the
playground and you use a seesaw that's
basically
a lever next we have a ramp
and ramps are very useful especially for
people who have difficulty
getting around some people unfortunately
cannot walk
whether it was an accident or was
because the way they were born
and so of course oh we should help these
people and you see
ramps in various places in our city
in this case there's a ramp on the city
bus a ramp is basically a surface it's
like a surface
at an angle that connects a lower level
to a higher level right so if somebody's
in a wheelchair
and they want to get on the bus they
can't use the stairs
so this is a good invention that helps
them
on the wheelchair they can just wheel
the wheelchair up the ramp and get on
the bus this way
of course we also see ramps at the front
of
every building there should be a ramp um
to help
people who are handicapped get into
these buildings we call this
handicapped access so ramps are very
useful
not just for handicapped people but also
if you want to move
objects heavy objects from a lower area
to a higher
area it's very difficult to try to drag
them over the stairs
it's much easier to put them on a wagon
with wheels
or some type of vehicle with wheels and
push it up the ramp that's a lot easier
and we'll see that idea later in the
lesson okay
those are the words for the vocabulary
section
let's take a look at the first main idea
of this lesson and as i said before
we're taking a look at how to make work
easier so
what makes work easier now as we have
seen from the vocabulary section i've
already talked about this a little bit
that there are many devices
or simple machines that make
physical work easier so
the first thing we looked at of course
was a pulley and a pulley can help
lift an object up and this is another
type of pulley you see the wheel here
you see the rope
here and by using that wheel it's
easier to lift a heavy object off the
ground
next we have a lever and of course as i
explained before
a very common type of lever you can see
on the playground that's a seesaw and so
you can
levers can also be uh playful things
right you can play on them
but be careful obviously but they are
very
they're fun to play with but a lever can
also help move things
because it can help you move heavy
objects
off the ground right if you can't lift
it with your arms
you can put a lever on it and you can
either stand on the other side of the
lever or put a heavy weight on the other
side of the lever
and that will help move the object up
off the ground
next we have a wheel of course a wheel
is very
useful for making physical work easier
because
it's hard to drag something on the
ground but if you put it
on something that has wheels then you
can easily
drag it or pull it behind you so a wheel
can help
pull heavy things and last we took a
look at a ramp and here's another good
example before we took
a look at a ramp on a bus and i
mentioned
you also have ramps in front of
buildings this is
a very good example you have stairs
which are which are typical which
used to be the normal ev you know
everybody had stairs
but thankfully there was a law passed
actually in america that required all
public buildings
to have a ramp to help people who cannot
use the stairs
to also get into the building because
why should they be left out
that's not that's not right okay so a
ramp can move things from one level
to another from a lower level to a
higher level okay so those are some
examples
of simple devices or things that help
make work easier
what are some other simple machines that
also
make work easier we can see some three
more examples
here we have a wedge a wedge what is a
wedge
is it an axe well you think about the ax
the shape of the axe head
right now i'm not a very good artist i'm
sorry about that
but if you have an axe and i'm gonna
here's the handle of the axe right
and you have the ax handle and this is a
sharp edge
if you if you turn that and you look at
it like this
it looks kind of like a triangle right
so now i'm looking at it
from the top down and this edge here
is here right so this is a wedge it's
like a triangle
and you have a sharp point here and it's
thicker here
because there's more force behind it
right it helps to put more force betw
behind the sharp edge if you want to cut
or split things and of course that's why
an
axe is so good at splitting wood you
know you want you want to cut
the wood to put in your fireplace or for
other reasons
uh wedges are used to cut or split
things in half and that's that's
basically what it is
if if this is heavier if you have more
more if it's very thin it won't have as
much force but if you put more
mass more weight behind the cutting edge
then it's easier to cut it cuts with
more force
so you can easily cut little pieces of
wood
or little logs with an axe
okay good the next you see screw
do not call this nasa that is not
correct okay
a screw a screw is exactly what we see
here this is the whole screw
this up here is the head of the screw
and this is the part of the screw that
goes into the wood
and on the head of the screw you see
these grooves usually it's
it can be just one line but it's more
efficient if you have
two lines crossed like this right and of
course you have the screwdriver that
fits into those lines and it's easy to
turn that screw
to put into wood because you have two
pieces of wood how do you hold them
together
well if you have a long enough screw you
can put a screw through one piece of
wood and it goes through the piece of
wood and into the second piece of wood
and it holds them together and screws
are great
of course you could use a nail a nail
doesn't have a
doesn't have these ridges you don't turn
a nail like this
you just i'm again i'm not a very good
artist you just
you just hit the nail and it's just a
piece of metal that goes in
but what if you want to move it then you
have to take the nail out
and it's very difficult to take a nail
out but with a screw hey just use a
screwdriver
and turn the other way the screw comes
right out so screws are more efficient
or sometimes more useful than nails
but they hold things together usually
pieces of wood
next we have wheel and axle that's
interesting i would call this
a wheelbarrow a wheel
barrow barrow a barrow is just you know
it's
it's like this is the barrow and this is
the wheel
and basically the barrow is don't call
it a barrel call it a wheelbarrow
a wheelbarrow is a wheel and axel and
they help you
move things because of course it has a
wheel it has the axle here
that connects it to the body and
basically it's a lot easier to move this
imagine if you have like a lot of sacks
of rice
let's just use that as an example you
have like five
heavy bags of rice and you want to move
them from here
to over there now you can pick up each
bag oh very difficult put on your
shoulder
and walk over there and back five times
or
you can pick up the bag of a rice put it
in the wheelbarrow
just right there put them all in there
then pick up the wheelbarrow over here
this is actually like a lever right so
it's easier to pick it up because most
the weight is on the wheel
and then you just push it over to where
you're going if you're going a long
distance
that makes it a lot easier so
wheelbarrows
are very commonly used where people have
to move heavy objects a lot of heavy
objects
from one area to another so it could be
bags of rice
it could be a bunch of bricks it could
be bags of cement
actually you know wheelbarrows are very
commonly used in construction
sites because you have to move heavy
materials from one area
to another so that's what we call a
wheelbarrow or
they say wheel and axle but don't say do
you see the wheel and axle don't say
that
say do you see the wheel barrel but
basically it's a wheel
and axle but don't call it that call it
a wheelbarrow
okay let's move on
it's time to look at the reading passage
together as usual
i will read it out loud you guys repeat
after me or just think about the words
in your head you know repeat along in
your head
focus on the vocabulary and try to pick
up any extra words
along the way you guys ready let's begin
work is how much force is used
to move something if you push
or pull an object and it moves
work is done but if the
object does not move then no work
has been done a
heavy box is hard to lift
a lot of work is needed a pulley
makes it easier to lift the box
less work is needed
okay
a heavy box is hard to pull
it's also hard to push a heavy box is
hard to pull
there is a lot of friction between the
box
and the floor remember in a previous
lesson we talked about
friction right it's the force between
two things and it makes it hard
so there's a lot of friction between the
box and the floor
it is easier to pull the box
on a wagon there is less
friction between the wagon wheels
and the ground right the wagon wheels
turn so there's less friction there's
still friction
but it's a lot easier okay
a heavy wagon is hard to carry upstairs
it is easier to pull the wagon upstairs
on a ramp less work is
needed i'm sorry keep interrupting but
yeah
think about that a heavy wagon is hard
to carry upstairs if you try to pull it
up the stairs go
funk thunk right it keeps hitting the
stairs
and you have to have a lot of work to
pull it up each stair
a ramp is much easier
less work is needed okay
a seesaw is a lever it makes it
easier to move our friends into the
air okay but be careful about moving
your friends into the air
you don't want to move them in the air
too fast okay but a seesaw is a fun
uh play thing on the playground to play
with
okay that's the reading section let's
take a look at how
the information is organized
okay the organization here is main idea
and details as usual we have a main idea
up here and then we have details
down here to support that main idea
what is the main idea the main idea is
work is how much force is used to move
something
now what we can see in the details is
do we need a lot of force or a little
force and we see some ideas of machines
or devices
that allow us to apply
less work to do the same amount of work
that's kind of a strange concept
but to do the same object or the goal we
need
less work to accomplish these things so
first of all we have
a a beep uses less
work to lift a heavy object so what was
the device is
actually the first word in the
vocabulary section that we use
to lift a heavy object to lift remember
it means to move from a lower position
to a higher position so if you want to
do that what
device should you use you should use of
course
a pulley a pulley a pulley uses less
work to lift a heavy object
into the air okay now next we have
another example
a seesaw a seesaw is a what we talked
about this
it is a type of lever
it is a lever and with a lever you can
move a heavy object by putting weight on
the other side
and of course the seesaw is an example
of a lever
next we have a wagon is hard to pull
upstairs of course we talk about you
know
you know it's very difficult to pull a
wagon up the stairs
and you probably don't want to do that
because your mom or dad will get mad at
you because you're kind of damaging the
stairs as well
so don't do that but if
you have there's two things going on
that you can use to make that wagon
easy to pull from a lower position to a
higher position
what's the first thing of course the
wagon has what the wagon has wheels on
it so that makes it easy
the wagons wheels but the wagons wheels
and what not the stairs use something
else
that doesn't have you know stairs it's
smoother it's
it's it's like a it's like a smooth
surface at an
angle we call that a ramp so those two
things
so the wagons wheels and a ramp
make it easier to push or pull the wagon
upstairs okay so that makes it a lot
easier to get
a heavy wagon from a lower position to a
higher position
don't try to pull it up the stairs it's
very difficult and it might damage the
stairs and the wheels of your wagon
okay next if you push a box on the
ground there is what there's remember
that in a previous lesson we talked
about this
there's a lot of force that that makes
it difficult especially of a rough
surface remember we talked about rough
and smooth surfaces
if it's especially a rough surface and
most ground is rough
it's very difficult just to push the box
across the
the ground because why what is that
force we talked about
that force of course is called friction
friction so you want to reduce the
amount of friction
so you put wheels under the box whether
you put the box on a wagon
or even a car a delivery truck it has
wheels on it so
the wheels can move more easily over the
ground because there's a lot less
friction
so you don't need to have as much work
you don't need to put as much work or
force onto the object to move it over
a surface because you're eliminating a
lot of the friction
and that's why of course wheel was such
a great invention
as i mentioned before okay so this
lesson is about work and how to make
work easier right as we say
work smarter not harder
right so by using these devices you are
working
smarter not harder and that's a good
idea because you want to save
you save time you save your energy
and you can get more work done so work
smarter
not harder well work hard but but
you can work smart not so hard okay good
so anyway that's this lesson today and i
hope you learned some interesting
vocabulary and also some
interesting ideas about the machines
that you do see
around you every day if you look
carefully at machines you know a lot of
times we use machines we don't even
think about how they work
look at how they work what are the
different parts are they using levers
are they using pulleys
think about the elevator in your
apartment building it uses
a pulley at the top interesting so there
are lots of different things that you
can look around
and see how work is made easier
okay well i hope you enjoyed this lesson
and i hope to see in the next one
take care everybody bye bye

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading my name is brian
00:12
stewart
00:13
and in this lesson we're going over
00:15
science book 4
00:16
lesson 13 work
00:20
is that a good lesson topic i don't know
00:23
but don't worry
00:24
we don't have to work during this lesson
00:26
we can
00:27
learn about work and we can learn about
00:29
physical work
00:30
is the subject of this lesson for
00:32
example you will discover
00:34
how to make work easier great
00:37
and also what are some simple machines
00:41
okay so let's begin
00:46
the first word in our vocabulary section
00:49
is
00:50
pulley pulley what's a pulley well a
00:52
pulley is a device
00:54
when people say it's a device it's it
00:56
you know it's like a simple machine
00:58
or it's a some kind of tool that you can
01:01
use
01:02
to perform some action so a pulley is a
01:05
device
01:06
with a wheel and the wheel is here you
01:08
can see the wheel is here
01:09
and a rope and you see the rope sticking
01:12
up here right
01:13
for lifting heavy objects so it's a
01:15
device to help you
01:17
lift heavy objects right if this is an
01:19
object
01:20
that you want to lift up and maybe move
01:22
somewhere else you can tie a rope to it
01:24
maybe tie another weight over
01:26
here and then you can use the wheel to
01:28
pull it up
01:29
and then you can swing this part and
01:31
then that
01:32
makes it a crane you swing it over and
01:35
then you can lower it down to where you
01:36
want it
01:37
and that's what a pulley is basically a
01:39
pulley is useful for
01:41
for lifting heavy objects it makes it
01:43
easier to move them around
01:46
okay next we have lift and i just said
01:49
that lift
01:50
a pulley makes it easier to lift heavy
01:53
objects so lift here
01:55
is a verb right and it means to to do
01:58
something to do what
01:59
to move something from a lower position
02:03
to a higher position so if you have
02:06
something down here
02:07
and you lift it up here you're moving it
02:10
from a lower position
02:12
to a higher position so from a lower
02:15
position
02:16
to a higher position and of course it
02:18
looks like this
02:19
is on a crane c-r-a-n-e
02:23
which is u attached to a pulley on the
02:26
crane then they're lifting it up
02:27
okay wheel
02:31
we saw a wheel before on the pulley but
02:33
a wheel of course is also
02:35
on a wagon or on a car it's a round
02:38
object
02:39
the shape of it is round and it's a
02:42
round object on a vehicle
02:44
but it can also be on a pulley as we
02:46
just saw which
02:48
lets it move on the ground of course on
02:50
a vehicle
02:51
the wheel lets it move on the ground
02:53
because the wheel can turn easily it's
02:55
round it's very easy
02:57
to turn this way or the other way
02:58
depending on which way you're going
03:00
but it's very easy to turn it and as it
03:02
turns it moves
03:04
across the ground so wheels were a great
03:07
invention
03:08
many thousands of years ago because they
03:10
helped
03:13
people a long long long long time ago
03:16
do their work more easily right they
03:18
needed to move something from here
03:20
to there hey if you use wheels on
03:22
whatever you're using to move
03:24
it's a lot easier to move it so wheel
03:27
was a great invention
03:29
wagon now wagon in this wagon here
03:34
you know there's many different kinds of
03:35
wagon this is a wagon that the pioneers
03:38
use to move across the united states
03:41
and in other countries as well but a
03:43
wagon of course is a vehicle with
03:45
four wheels usually pulled by horses
03:49
usually not always because these are not
03:51
horses
03:52
horses don't have those big horns
03:54
sticking out of them
03:55
out of their heads so usually horses are
03:58
are used to pull wagons but
04:00
you know many different animals uh
04:03
animal power was very important of
04:04
course before the invention
04:06
of the machine and different types of
04:08
animals were used
04:09
for their power for their pulling power
04:12
in this case we have um
04:14
a couple of ox uh oxen
04:17
uh and of course horses are also used as
04:20
well actually looking at this picture a
04:21
little bit more
04:22
i'm seeing that the ox they're not real
04:26
okay i was like wait a minute it's that
04:28
ox back is very shiny
04:30
it's not it's not a real ox okay so but
04:32
anyway
04:33
the what we're looking at is a wagon and
04:35
we see the wheels are here
04:38
and of course there's four you can't see
04:39
the fourth wheel but
04:41
a wagon is very useful of course for
04:43
putting stuff in the wagon
04:45
and then moving it from one place to
04:46
another makes work
04:48
easier next we have a lever
04:51
a lever is another thing that helps make
04:53
work
04:54
easier because you can use a lever to
04:57
move a heavy object a famous scientist
05:00
once said
05:01
give me a lever long enough and i can
05:03
move the earth of course you'd need
05:05
you need a lot more other equipment to
05:07
be able to do that but basically what he
05:09
was saying is that lovers his point was
05:11
that levers
05:12
are very powerful and if you have a
05:14
lever that's long enough and strong
05:15
enough
05:16
you can move very heavy objects objects
05:18
that you think
05:19
that are not uh that are impossible to
05:22
lift so
05:24
a lever is a long object used to move an
05:27
object upward of course you need a lever
05:29
this this
05:30
piece of board is acting as a lever but
05:32
you also need
05:34
this to put the lever on you need some
05:37
point
05:37
to get leverage to be able to put it on
05:40
there and of course this has to be
05:42
strong enough to support the weight
05:44
of whatever it is that you want to move
05:47
up
05:47
what does this look like by the way it
05:49
looks like a seesaw right
05:51
so you use a lever when you go to the
05:52
playground and you use a seesaw that's
05:54
basically
05:55
a lever next we have a ramp
05:59
and ramps are very useful especially for
06:01
people who have difficulty
06:04
getting around some people unfortunately
06:06
cannot walk
06:08
whether it was an accident or was
06:10
because the way they were born
06:11
and so of course oh we should help these
06:14
people and you see
06:15
ramps in various places in our city
06:18
in this case there's a ramp on the city
06:20
bus a ramp is basically a surface it's
06:23
like a surface
06:24
at an angle that connects a lower level
06:28
to a higher level right so if somebody's
06:30
in a wheelchair
06:31
and they want to get on the bus they
06:33
can't use the stairs
06:34
so this is a good invention that helps
06:36
them
06:38
on the wheelchair they can just wheel
06:40
the wheelchair up the ramp and get on
06:42
the bus this way
06:43
of course we also see ramps at the front
06:45
of
06:46
every building there should be a ramp um
06:48
to help
06:49
people who are handicapped get into
06:51
these buildings we call this
06:53
handicapped access so ramps are very
06:56
useful
06:56
not just for handicapped people but also
06:59
if you want to move
07:00
objects heavy objects from a lower area
07:03
to a higher
07:04
area it's very difficult to try to drag
07:06
them over the stairs
07:07
it's much easier to put them on a wagon
07:10
with wheels
07:10
or some type of vehicle with wheels and
07:14
push it up the ramp that's a lot easier
07:16
and we'll see that idea later in the
07:18
lesson okay
07:19
those are the words for the vocabulary
07:22
section
07:25
let's take a look at the first main idea
07:27
of this lesson and as i said before
07:29
we're taking a look at how to make work
07:32
easier so
07:33
what makes work easier now as we have
07:35
seen from the vocabulary section i've
07:37
already talked about this a little bit
07:39
that there are many devices
07:41
or simple machines that make
07:44
physical work easier so
07:48
the first thing we looked at of course
07:49
was a pulley and a pulley can help
07:52
lift an object up and this is another
07:54
type of pulley you see the wheel here
07:56
you see the rope
07:57
here and by using that wheel it's
08:00
easier to lift a heavy object off the
08:02
ground
08:04
next we have a lever and of course as i
08:06
explained before
08:07
a very common type of lever you can see
08:09
on the playground that's a seesaw and so
08:12
you can
08:12
levers can also be uh playful things
08:15
right you can play on them
08:16
but be careful obviously but they are
08:20
very
08:20
they're fun to play with but a lever can
08:22
also help move things
08:24
because it can help you move heavy
08:26
objects
08:27
off the ground right if you can't lift
08:29
it with your arms
08:30
you can put a lever on it and you can
08:33
either stand on the other side of the
08:34
lever or put a heavy weight on the other
08:36
side of the lever
08:37
and that will help move the object up
08:39
off the ground
08:40
next we have a wheel of course a wheel
08:43
is very
08:44
useful for making physical work easier
08:47
because
08:48
it's hard to drag something on the
08:50
ground but if you put it
08:51
on something that has wheels then you
08:53
can easily
08:55
drag it or pull it behind you so a wheel
08:58
can help
08:58
pull heavy things and last we took a
09:02
look at a ramp and here's another good
09:04
example before we took
09:05
a look at a ramp on a bus and i
09:08
mentioned
09:08
you also have ramps in front of
09:10
buildings this is
09:11
a very good example you have stairs
09:13
which are which are typical which
09:16
used to be the normal ev you know
09:17
everybody had stairs
09:19
but thankfully there was a law passed
09:21
actually in america that required all
09:23
public buildings
09:24
to have a ramp to help people who cannot
09:27
use the stairs
09:28
to also get into the building because
09:30
why should they be left out
09:31
that's not that's not right okay so a
09:34
ramp can move things from one level
09:36
to another from a lower level to a
09:39
higher level okay so those are some
09:42
examples
09:43
of simple devices or things that help
09:47
make work easier
09:51
what are some other simple machines that
09:54
also
09:54
make work easier we can see some three
09:57
more examples
09:58
here we have a wedge a wedge what is a
10:01
wedge
10:02
is it an axe well you think about the ax
10:05
the shape of the axe head
10:07
right now i'm not a very good artist i'm
10:09
sorry about that
10:10
but if you have an axe and i'm gonna
10:13
here's the handle of the axe right
10:15
and you have the ax handle and this is a
10:17
sharp edge
10:18
if you if you turn that and you look at
10:20
it like this
10:21
it looks kind of like a triangle right
10:24
so now i'm looking at it
10:25
from the top down and this edge here
10:28
is here right so this is a wedge it's
10:31
like a triangle
10:32
and you have a sharp point here and it's
10:34
thicker here
10:35
because there's more force behind it
10:37
right it helps to put more force betw
10:40
behind the sharp edge if you want to cut
10:42
or split things and of course that's why
10:44
an
10:44
axe is so good at splitting wood you
10:47
know you want you want to cut
10:49
the wood to put in your fireplace or for
10:51
other reasons
10:52
uh wedges are used to cut or split
10:55
things in half and that's that's
10:58
basically what it is
10:59
if if this is heavier if you have more
11:02
more if it's very thin it won't have as
11:05
much force but if you put more
11:06
mass more weight behind the cutting edge
11:10
then it's easier to cut it cuts with
11:12
more force
11:13
so you can easily cut little pieces of
11:16
wood
11:17
or little logs with an axe
11:20
okay good the next you see screw
11:23
do not call this nasa that is not
11:26
correct okay
11:28
a screw a screw is exactly what we see
11:30
here this is the whole screw
11:32
this up here is the head of the screw
11:34
and this is the part of the screw that
11:36
goes into the wood
11:37
and on the head of the screw you see
11:39
these grooves usually it's
11:40
it can be just one line but it's more
11:43
efficient if you have
11:45
two lines crossed like this right and of
11:48
course you have the screwdriver that
11:49
fits into those lines and it's easy to
11:51
turn that screw
11:53
to put into wood because you have two
11:54
pieces of wood how do you hold them
11:56
together
11:57
well if you have a long enough screw you
11:59
can put a screw through one piece of
12:00
wood and it goes through the piece of
12:01
wood and into the second piece of wood
12:03
and it holds them together and screws
12:06
are great
12:06
of course you could use a nail a nail
12:09
doesn't have a
12:10
doesn't have these ridges you don't turn
12:12
a nail like this
12:14
you just i'm again i'm not a very good
12:16
artist you just
12:17
you just hit the nail and it's just a
12:19
piece of metal that goes in
12:21
but what if you want to move it then you
12:23
have to take the nail out
12:25
and it's very difficult to take a nail
12:26
out but with a screw hey just use a
12:28
screwdriver
12:29
and turn the other way the screw comes
12:31
right out so screws are more efficient
12:34
or sometimes more useful than nails
12:37
but they hold things together usually
12:40
pieces of wood
12:42
next we have wheel and axle that's
12:45
interesting i would call this
12:47
a wheelbarrow a wheel
12:50
barrow barrow a barrow is just you know
12:53
it's
12:53
it's like this is the barrow and this is
12:56
the wheel
12:56
and basically the barrow is don't call
12:59
it a barrel call it a wheelbarrow
13:01
a wheelbarrow is a wheel and axel and
13:03
they help you
13:04
move things because of course it has a
13:06
wheel it has the axle here
13:08
that connects it to the body and
13:11
basically it's a lot easier to move this
13:13
imagine if you have like a lot of sacks
13:15
of rice
13:16
let's just use that as an example you
13:18
have like five
13:19
heavy bags of rice and you want to move
13:22
them from here
13:23
to over there now you can pick up each
13:25
bag oh very difficult put on your
13:27
shoulder
13:28
and walk over there and back five times
13:31
or
13:31
you can pick up the bag of a rice put it
13:34
in the wheelbarrow
13:35
just right there put them all in there
13:37
then pick up the wheelbarrow over here
13:39
this is actually like a lever right so
13:41
it's easier to pick it up because most
13:43
the weight is on the wheel
13:44
and then you just push it over to where
13:46
you're going if you're going a long
13:48
distance
13:48
that makes it a lot easier so
13:51
wheelbarrows
13:52
are very commonly used where people have
13:54
to move heavy objects a lot of heavy
13:56
objects
13:57
from one area to another so it could be
13:59
bags of rice
14:00
it could be a bunch of bricks it could
14:02
be bags of cement
14:03
actually you know wheelbarrows are very
14:05
commonly used in construction
14:07
sites because you have to move heavy
14:09
materials from one area
14:10
to another so that's what we call a
14:12
wheelbarrow or
14:14
they say wheel and axle but don't say do
14:16
you see the wheel and axle don't say
14:17
that
14:18
say do you see the wheel barrel but
14:20
basically it's a wheel
14:21
and axle but don't call it that call it
14:24
a wheelbarrow
14:25
okay let's move on
14:30
it's time to look at the reading passage
14:32
together as usual
14:34
i will read it out loud you guys repeat
14:37
after me or just think about the words
14:39
in your head you know repeat along in
14:40
your head
14:41
focus on the vocabulary and try to pick
14:43
up any extra words
14:45
along the way you guys ready let's begin
14:50
work is how much force is used
14:53
to move something if you push
14:57
or pull an object and it moves
15:00
work is done but if the
15:04
object does not move then no work
15:07
has been done a
15:12
heavy box is hard to lift
15:15
a lot of work is needed a pulley
15:18
makes it easier to lift the box
15:22
less work is needed
15:25
okay
15:28
a heavy box is hard to pull
15:31
it's also hard to push a heavy box is
15:34
hard to pull
15:35
there is a lot of friction between the
15:38
box
15:38
and the floor remember in a previous
15:40
lesson we talked about
15:42
friction right it's the force between
15:44
two things and it makes it hard
15:46
so there's a lot of friction between the
15:48
box and the floor
15:51
it is easier to pull the box
15:54
on a wagon there is less
15:57
friction between the wagon wheels
16:00
and the ground right the wagon wheels
16:04
turn so there's less friction there's
16:06
still friction
16:07
but it's a lot easier okay
16:11
a heavy wagon is hard to carry upstairs
16:15
it is easier to pull the wagon upstairs
16:18
on a ramp less work is
16:22
needed i'm sorry keep interrupting but
16:24
yeah
16:25
think about that a heavy wagon is hard
16:27
to carry upstairs if you try to pull it
16:28
up the stairs go
16:30
funk thunk right it keeps hitting the
16:33
stairs
16:33
and you have to have a lot of work to
16:35
pull it up each stair
16:37
a ramp is much easier
16:40
less work is needed okay
16:44
a seesaw is a lever it makes it
16:47
easier to move our friends into the
16:50
air okay but be careful about moving
16:53
your friends into the air
16:54
you don't want to move them in the air
16:56
too fast okay but a seesaw is a fun
16:59
uh play thing on the playground to play
17:02
with
17:03
okay that's the reading section let's
17:05
take a look at how
17:06
the information is organized
17:12
okay the organization here is main idea
17:15
and details as usual we have a main idea
17:17
up here and then we have details
17:19
down here to support that main idea
17:22
what is the main idea the main idea is
17:26
work is how much force is used to move
17:29
something
17:31
now what we can see in the details is
17:34
do we need a lot of force or a little
17:36
force and we see some ideas of machines
17:38
or devices
17:40
that allow us to apply
17:43
less work to do the same amount of work
17:46
that's kind of a strange concept
17:47
but to do the same object or the goal we
17:51
need
17:51
less work to accomplish these things so
17:53
first of all we have
17:54
a a beep uses less
17:57
work to lift a heavy object so what was
18:01
the device is
18:01
actually the first word in the
18:02
vocabulary section that we use
18:05
to lift a heavy object to lift remember
18:07
it means to move from a lower position
18:09
to a higher position so if you want to
18:11
do that what
18:12
device should you use you should use of
18:15
course
18:15
a pulley a pulley a pulley uses less
18:20
work to lift a heavy object
18:22
into the air okay now next we have
18:26
another example
18:27
a seesaw a seesaw is a what we talked
18:30
about this
18:30
it is a type of lever
18:35
it is a lever and with a lever you can
18:38
move a heavy object by putting weight on
18:40
the other side
18:40
and of course the seesaw is an example
18:42
of a lever
18:44
next we have a wagon is hard to pull
18:47
upstairs of course we talk about you
18:48
know
18:49
you know it's very difficult to pull a
18:52
wagon up the stairs
18:53
and you probably don't want to do that
18:54
because your mom or dad will get mad at
18:56
you because you're kind of damaging the
18:57
stairs as well
18:58
so don't do that but if
19:02
you have there's two things going on
19:03
that you can use to make that wagon
19:06
easy to pull from a lower position to a
19:08
higher position
19:09
what's the first thing of course the
19:11
wagon has what the wagon has wheels on
19:13
it so that makes it easy
19:15
the wagons wheels but the wagons wheels
19:18
and what not the stairs use something
19:21
else
19:22
that doesn't have you know stairs it's
19:24
smoother it's
19:25
it's it's like a it's like a smooth
19:27
surface at an
19:28
angle we call that a ramp so those two
19:31
things
19:32
so the wagons wheels and a ramp
19:36
make it easier to push or pull the wagon
19:40
upstairs okay so that makes it a lot
19:44
easier to get
19:45
a heavy wagon from a lower position to a
19:48
higher position
19:49
don't try to pull it up the stairs it's
19:51
very difficult and it might damage the
19:53
stairs and the wheels of your wagon
19:56
okay next if you push a box on the
19:58
ground there is what there's remember
20:00
that in a previous lesson we talked
20:02
about this
20:02
there's a lot of force that that makes
20:06
it difficult especially of a rough
20:07
surface remember we talked about rough
20:08
and smooth surfaces
20:10
if it's especially a rough surface and
20:12
most ground is rough
20:14
it's very difficult just to push the box
20:16
across the
20:17
the ground because why what is that
20:19
force we talked about
20:20
that force of course is called friction
20:24
friction so you want to reduce the
20:27
amount of friction
20:28
so you put wheels under the box whether
20:31
you put the box on a wagon
20:33
or even a car a delivery truck it has
20:36
wheels on it so
20:37
the wheels can move more easily over the
20:39
ground because there's a lot less
20:41
friction
20:41
so you don't need to have as much work
20:44
you don't need to put as much work or
20:46
force onto the object to move it over
20:50
a surface because you're eliminating a
20:52
lot of the friction
20:53
and that's why of course wheel was such
20:55
a great invention
20:56
as i mentioned before okay so this
21:00
lesson is about work and how to make
21:01
work easier right as we say
21:04
work smarter not harder
21:07
right so by using these devices you are
21:10
working
21:11
smarter not harder and that's a good
21:14
idea because you want to save
21:16
you save time you save your energy
21:19
and you can get more work done so work
21:22
smarter
21:23
not harder well work hard but but
21:26
you can work smart not so hard okay good
21:30
so anyway that's this lesson today and i
21:32
hope you learned some interesting
21:34
vocabulary and also some
21:35
interesting ideas about the machines
21:37
that you do see
21:38
around you every day if you look
21:40
carefully at machines you know a lot of
21:42
times we use machines we don't even
21:44
think about how they work
21:45
look at how they work what are the
21:46
different parts are they using levers
21:48
are they using pulleys
21:50
think about the elevator in your
21:51
apartment building it uses
21:53
a pulley at the top interesting so there
21:56
are lots of different things that you
21:57
can look around
21:58
and see how work is made easier
22:01
okay well i hope you enjoyed this lesson
22:03
and i hope to see in the next one
22:04
take care everybody bye bye
22:15
[Music]
22:24
oh
