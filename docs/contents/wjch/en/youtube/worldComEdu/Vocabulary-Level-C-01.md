hello kids
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
i'm your host brian stewart
in this lesson we're starting a new
level level
c right and in level c we're talking
about a lot of different subjects we'll
talk about
science so some lessons will be about
science
some lessons will be about social
studies
some lessons will be about health so
those are important right of course
they're all important
fine arts will also be the subject of
other lessons fine arts like painting
and sculpture and artists
right math well math is interesting
we can take a look at some lessons about
math and
a new subject entertainment so that will
be interesting too
also something new with level c is that
some lessons will have
short videos in them so hopefully that
will be fun
and interesting to look at those so
shall we get started with lesson number
one
you bet let's get going okay number one
lesson one we're talking about animals
and
our subject of course is science right
especially biology the study of life
so animals we're going to be looking at
the the
name of the unit is in a land before
time actually the name of the lesson in
a land before
time what does that mean well think
about it
be when was time thought of right
human beings invented time so this is
like
before humans a long time ago
the earth is millions and millions and
millions
of years old humans haven't always been
on the earth so what was the earth like
what kind of animals lived on the earth
before
human beings so in this lesson we can
learn about
dinosaurs from their bones
because dinosaurs lived on the earth a
long
long long long
long time before human beings
came about okay let's take a look here
we have
a video for you what exactly is a
dinosaur
you probably know what a dinosaur is
right there's many
uh television shows animation
uh shows and movies about dinosaurs
right you've probably seen some of those
of course a dinosaur is like a big
terrible lizard right it looks like
like this oh my gosh look at that that's
kind of oh my gosh
look at that that's a huge dinosaur
that's kind of scary isn't it
is he gone oh he's still there okay he's
gone
we got rid of the dinosaur okay
dinosaurs were really really scary
we're very very lucky that there are no
more dinosaurs
because they're huge some dinosaurs were
huge we'll learn more about dinosaurs
in this lesson okay but as we get
started
of course we need to learn some
vocabulary
let's take a look the first vocabulary
word
the definition a hot hot place
with a lot of plants so if you think of
a
hot place there are many plants there
what do we call
that type of environment we say it is a
jungle a jungle and you can think if you
go
south or if you go to southeast asia if
you go to vietnam
thailand the philippines those are very
hot places
there are many plants there it's they
have many jungles
in those places a hot place with a lot
of
plants jungle okay next one
oh this is the opposite of a jungle
right it's very cold
there's a lot of snow on the ground but
look at what happens
when somebody walks across the snow
they're making marks so this word
is a mark made by a foot
right when a person or an animal is
walking
in the snow in the sand
in the mud what do they leave behind
them
they leave behind them a foot print
foot print footprint
this person is leaving many footprints
behind them remember footprint is
singular
hana right if you say footprint you mean
hanuman if you say footprints you mean
manio right many so footprints be
careful
sometimes students will make that
mistake footprint is only one
but you can't leave just one footprint
unless you're jumping really far right
so you leave
footprints behind you next one
oh what's this this looks very old
doesn't it
this of course is the bone around
your brain this is a person's head
someone who died
a long time ago the only thing that's
left
is the bone bones last for a long time
skin hair organs those
things dissolve and they go away
after somebody dies but the bone stays
for a long time
so the bone around your brain what do we
call this bone
we call this bone a skull now that's a
little hard to pronounce right
s k and ll at the end
s k sk
sk and l l just oh so
and we have the u skull
skull so we say that word as skull
now a lot of times when we see the skull
we think of
death right that's a symbol for death
you guys know pirates right the pirate
flag
is a skull and
crossbones what that means is they take
two bones and they cross them right now
i'm not a very good artist
but i'll try to make a skull now i'll
just make the crossbones i can't really
draw
a skull am i doing okay yeah i seem to
be doing all okay
it's kind of like a bone here right so
the crossbones so they'll have a
flag and they'll have a skull on the top
and they'll have crossbones
skull and crossbones is a very common
flag
for pirates if you see a pirate ship
they have a black
flag and a white skull and crossbones on
it
so skull is usually associated with
death because
pirates are bad guys right okay
four the weather conditions in a certain
place
so if you're talking about the weather
conditions it's hot
and sunny or it's cold and snowy
how do we one word how do we describe
those
conditions with one word we say what is
the
climate like what
is the whoops
the climate
what is the climate like
right it's very common if you're
talking to a friend you make a friend on
the internet
or with email through your school a
program
and you meet a friend in africa and you
want to exchange
emails with that friend or you meet a
friend in finland
and you can ask them what is the climate
like in your country the person in
africa will
probably say hot and humid the person in
finland
will probably say cold and snowy so
what are the weather conditions in a
certain
place okay number five
to continue to live if something
continues to live
they endure they
survive right i can't i can't say it
without saying the word right
survive that's a little difficult word
to say
remember sir vive it's two sounds
one two sir vive
survive so when you put them together
survive
one more time survive so survive
means to continue to live not
die so if something doesn't die it
continues to live
and this is for individuals but it's
also for
groups too right of course individuals
die
all the time but groups of animals might
survive
for a very long time okay
six interesting and special
very interesting very special city
very beautiful city right what do we say
it's
remarkable now this is a long word right
re mar ca
bull if you're going to split it up into
sounds you got one
two three four so four syllables
re marco remarkable
and you know you remark you probably put
it there to remark
uh you don't have to say mar remar kabul
but you know it depends on how you
pronounce it
so you can say if you put them all
together it sounds remarkable
remarkable okay one more time remarkable
remarkable interesting and special
okay let's move on to number seven
to keep from being ruined of course if
you leave
food open to the air it will begin to
smell
it will go bad but you want to keep it
from being ruined you want to
keep it in its original state or close
to its original state
what do you do you preserve it
preserve so again we have two
sounds preserved now this looks like
serve
but don't say pre-serve say preserve
preserve okay and that is a
verb to keep something from being ruined
to preserve something so you are going
to keep it
in the original state so it doesn't get
old if you want to keep
food for a long time you put it in a can
you preserve it so you can eat it two
months later
four months later maybe even a year
later
but even food in a can you can't keep it
forever right you got to eat it sometime
because it will get ruined after a
certain amount of time
but you can preserve it for a long time
in a can eight well it's a strange
looking animal
right what animal is this do you know
maybe you learn from history or from
lessons in school what's wrong with this
pen uh
oh here we go dodo it's a dodo bird
have you heard of the dodo bird before
the dodo bird
uh well that's weird the dodo bird
went extinct and that's our word extinct
so when people think of the word extinct
it's very common to think of the dodo
bird it's a very famous bird
that died when human beings came to the
island
where it lived extinct means no longer
in existence the human beings killed all
the dodo birds and
they brought dogs with them the dogs
also hunted the birds
so in a very short time all the dodo
birds
went extinct so we can use the word
go as past tense right to go
go extinct the dodo bird went extinct
past
tense okay no longer in existence
is extinct and many animals have become
extinct
over the history of the earth the
earth's history is very very very very
long
and many animals have gone extinct many
types of animals
nine sometimes of course animals will
leave
evidence that they existed and that
evidence is their remains
the remains what is left behind
the remains of an animal or plant so
it's an animal
or a plant not just animal but also
plants
leave remains and you can find them in
the rocks
usually the animal or plant dies in mud
and the mud is compressed under pressure
and that mud becomes rock well the
imprint
the imprint of the animal's body
or the plant's body is left or made into
the rock and these are very
neat if you find them what am i talking
about i'm talking about
fossils very cool very
neat if you find a fossil in the rock so
next time you're in the country
next time you're in walking through the
mountains or walking through a field
and you see some interesting rocks take
a look at them see if you can find
any fossils who knows maybe you'll find
an interesting fossil
okay next word this one is to be
present in a place this is a picture it
looks like
mars of course many scientists
uh have been wondering if water
exists on mars
so if water is present in a place like
water is on mars then water exists
on mars and of course we now know
that at the north pole and the south
pole you can't see it because the
mars is tilted like this you can't see
the south pole but at the north pole
there's frozen water ice right
so there is water water does exist
on mars okay
number 11 a small plant with many
branches so these are very common we see
these around buildings
and in parks people like to grow them
because they
form like a small wall so you know
people
don't go over that of course we call it
a bush
a bush now of course these are little
bushes a lot of bushes in a line
you call a hedge a hedge
right and this is like a hedge it's a
line of bushes
that people will make in a park or near
a building
to you know like a little small little
wall but there's as many bushes a
small plant with many branches we call
it a bush
not a tree right we can say there's like
two main types of plants we can see
easily one is a tree of course a tree
grows
very big i got a mushroom cloud here
okay
okay that's a tree and then of course
you have a little
little bush right so a bush and a tree
right so uh we talk about bushes and we
talk about trees those are the two
main types of plants of course you have
other types
but usually we see trees and bushes
number 12 a climbing plant this is
another type of plant
a climbing plant what does it mean a
plant that climbs
yes because these branches or
long thin stems right you can say a
branch is like a tree branch it's very
thick
it's very strong but some plants are
very they have arms or branches that are
very small and they're very
they're not strong you can bend them and
we call those
stems okay so long thin stems
and this is a plant with long thin stems
that grow and
climb up walls so it's a climbing plant
we call it a vine so on some very
old buildings especially old brick
buildings
you can see that they're covered with a
green plant
because the plant it's called a vine has
grown
up and they hook they've got little
hooks on the stems
and they hook onto the wall and they
climb up the wall very
nice looking very neat thirteen
to wind together so if you take some
dead
branches some stems and you wind them
together like this
what are you doing it's a verb to twist
to wind together you can wind plants
together
you can wind your i'm too old i can't do
it you can wind your arms together
right you can wind rope together
you can wind or you can twist many
things so you can twist your arms
you can twist rope you can twist your
hair
you can twist something together or to
wind
together fourteen oh he's having a lot
of fun isn't he
don't you wish you could have fun like
that well you can but don't tell your
mom i told you to go out and play in the
mud okay
wet dirt of course i just said it it's
mud
and sometimes in korea i forgot where it
was i'm not sure the name
i'm a little worried if i mispronounced
it it's boring boring
mud festival is that right yeah in korea
you have a mud festival at boryang
bordeaux
or bordeaux place i'm not sure but um
many people will go there and they'll
play in the mud
right during the summer it's a nice
thing to do it's cool
and it's wet so people you know it's
kind of like water playing in the water
so it's mud and people will play in it
people will throw it at each other of
course normally
don't step in it because if you're
wearing nice clothes your mother will
get angry
if you get mud on your clothes okay
next word an animal that lived long ago
but is now extinct ah that's one of the
words we learned before
extinct it doesn't exist anymore
it's gone it did not survive and of
course we saw this animal before right
the video
that i was scared of before that's a
scary animal right
of course it is a dinosaur it's an
animal that lived long ago
but is now extinct it doesn't exist
anymore because if it did
we would be in big danger right there
would be too many of them
dinosaur dinosaur three were
three sounds dinosaur it looks like
dinosaur but we say
dinosaur okay
some people can say dinosaur but most
common it's
dinosaur dinosaur okay
another word here a place where you can
see
many important things so if you want to
learn about things
that existed a long long time ago
or things that you know exist now but
usually
they're from history and people will
take them and display them
in certain buildings what is that
building called
it's called a museum museum
museum a place where you can see
many important things so here we see uh
things from ancient
excuse me ancient egypt right a long
time ago
we can see the mummies right and you can
see mummies
in a museum you can see things from your
country
that existed a long time ago in a museum
in natural museums natural history
museums
we can see animals that existed a long
time ago
in natural history museums okay
let's go over exercise here the first
exercise has to do with
antonyms antonym what is an antonym
antonym means oh let's draw that
line here a little bit more slowly
antonym
means words that have opposite
opposite opposite
meaning it's like pandero right pandiro
opposite meaning antonym so our
instruction
our direction is match the words
in the box here with their
antonyms listed below so these
words are the opposite of these
words that's what we have to do we have
to match the opposites
okay the words are preserved
right we learned the word preserve we
learned that it was a
verb so now it's used
with an ed so it's past tense like
preserved
they have been preserved next one
jungle jungle next one
survive survive and last one
extinct extinct
okay what are the opposites of these
words number one is
alive what is the opposite meaning
of alive something that is not alive
anymore
it's dead and maybe all of them are dead
then we can say
extinct if they're extinct they're dead
they're gone
no more but if they're alive they
continue to exist
okay next one desert
what is a desert a desert is a hot place
but it has no plants no
plants grow in a desert it's just dirt
or just
sand there's no plants so what's the
opposite
of a desert we could say it's a
jungle because a jungle has many many
plants
there's a lot of water in the jungle
there is
no water in the desert or very little
water
in the desert three die
so that's a sad word right die so what's
the opposite of die
if something dies right it doesn't what
it doesn't survive any longer it's not
alive right
by the way dying alive those are also
antonyms aren't they
die and survive are also antonyms
okay the last one here ruined if
something is
ruined it's been spoiled it has changed
from its original condition but if you
keep something in the original condition
it doesn't change you have preserved it
it's not ruined it is preserved
it's not ruined it's preserved okay
so those are the antonyms the opposite
meaning
of these words now our next exercise
is talking about synonyms right
before we talked about antonyms now
we're going to talk about synonyms
what does synonyms mean synonym is same
the same meaning so a cinnamon is a word
or two words that have the same or
similar pistandeo right maybe not
okay so maybe not exactly the same but
similar meanings
okay same meanings match the words in
the box
with their synonyms listed below so
these words in the box
we need to match them with the word that
has the same
or similar meaning similar
so same or similar meaning
okay let's look at the words in the box
first
we have skull skull
next word footprints
footprints the next word is remarkable
remarkable the next one is climate
climate
okay now we have to match these words in
the box
to the same or similar meanings of these
words here
the first word is amazing amazing it's
really amazing it amazes you
it impresses you it's really exceptional
what do we say is a similar meaning we
would say of course remarkable
remarkable is similar to amazing
if you think wow that's amazing it is
remarkable okay the similar meaning
number two is head okay so head
not the same meaning but similar meaning
for head what's in your head
right what is that bone there we could
say it's the skull
so skull isn't the same as head but it
is
similar similar skull and head are
similar
three weather so we're talking about the
weather
in a certain place especially we're
talking about what what word
has to do with weather of course this
word
means weather climate so climate weather
is climate okay the last one is
marks now when we learn this word in the
vocabulary
we said marks that are left by feet
right if somebody's walking along
especially in the snow or the sand they
leave
marks in the snow or the sand what do we
call those marks
we call those marks yogitta
right here footprints right sorry
we call them footprints okay so marks
are footprints that we leave behind us
by our feet okay well that wraps up the
vocabulary
section we're going to take a short
break here we'll come back and look at
the reading
so don't go away
