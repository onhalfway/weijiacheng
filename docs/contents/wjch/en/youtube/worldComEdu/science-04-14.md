hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
my name is brian stewart and in this
lesson we're looking at science book
for lesson 14
and the title of the lesson is sources
of heat i hope you're warm if you are
warm
how are you warm where is your heat
coming from are you
are is it coming from the sun is it
coming from
the heater in your house interesting
question
in this lesson we will be taking a look
at two main ideas
one idea is how heat is created
and the second idea is how heat moves
okay let's begin the first word in the
vocabulary section
is natural gas
natural gas is a gas which is burned
for energy natural gas is an interesting
word i mean
we know what gas is gas is what you put
in your car
right to make your car run but
what's natural gas isn't all gas natural
no it's not because the gas that you put
in your car really isn't natural it is
uh taken from oil run through a factory
that produces gas that you put in your
car however
deep underground there are pockets of
gas and when we talk about gas i'm not
talking about the liquid gas
that you put in your car i'm talking
about a gas like
air it's it's like air and it's trapped
underground
and it burns because of the uh the
chemical
composition it can burn very quickly in
fact it's kind of dangerous
because it can explode and you might
you probably have natural gas in your
home when you turn on your stove
right you can smell actually that smell
is added to it
but you can smell the gas coming from
your stove and then
you click on it and then it it makes a
flame and
your mom or your dad cooks food
on the stove don't play with your stove
of course i don't mean to encourage that
but that's an example of natural gas in
your home
and sometimes we have to be careful
about that because it can be dangerous
so don't play with that but that's an
example of natural
gas and it burns very easily
okay next is the stove i just
explained about natural gas you see
the fire here it's a blue flame
that what's burning that is the natural
gas
i was just talking about and of course
it's on your stove
stove is a device that makes heat
for cooking now many stoves are natural
gas stoves you could also have electric
stoves that just use an electric coil
to make heat but most stoves will use
natural gas
my wife likes to cook with natural gas
she likes it better than electric
but and it's it's quicker and it's uh
it's much more efficient but uh yeah
many many homes will have natural gas
stoves
for cooking it's a very easy way to cook
something in your kitchen
light bulb light bulb is a different
type of device of course it
doesn't use natural gas it uses
electricity to make light
and it also makes heat right so be
careful if the light bulb has been on
for a while
don't touch it it's hot of course new
modern light bulbs
stay cool but the older light bulbs they
get hot
so they make light they can also make
heat but that is a
light bulb by the way bulb
is what you call this especially this
shape
right that is a bulb and of course
because it makes light it is a light
bulb next we have
conductor conductor now you could use
conductor
means different things for different
situations if you go to see a concert
you see a man or a woman standing in
front of all the people playing their
instruments
and they're waving their hands like this
that is a conductor
that's a different kind of conductor the
conductor here
is a substance a material that
allows electricity or heat to travel
through it easily so if you look at
these what's the picture of the pictures
is of a bunch of pots
and pans right those are pans pans are
shallow
they're on the bottom the pots are deep
they're on the top
so pots and pans they're made out of
metal
why because metal is a substance
that allows electricity or heat in this
case
heat to travel through it quickly so if
you put
a metal pot onto your stove the heat
from the natural gas will pass through
the metal
to the food and it will cook quickly
if you used a different material other
than
metal the heat maybe wouldn't pass
through and your food would stay cold
or the material would burn depending on
the material right
but metal is a good conductor it allows
heat
and electricity to pass through it very
easily
copper is a good conductor of
electricity
so in the wires in your home they're
made of copper we
talked about this in a previous lesson
because electricity can pass through
copper
very easily okay so
a substance that allows heat or
electricity to pass through it
is a conductor okay and like i said you
can talk about different conductors like
the person in front of a band or the
person
who drives a train uh they're a
conductor
uh person who checks your tickets on the
train but in this case we're talking
about a substance that allows heat or
electricity
to pass through it quickly that is a
conductor
next we have friction we talked about
friction in a previous lesson
when we were talking about forces moving
across
different types of surfaces of course
friction
is the force that occurs when you rub
one object against another and when you
have friction right you're losing energy
but actually when you lose energy that
the energy is getting transferred
from one object to another and when that
energy gets
transferred what happens rub your hands
together what do you feel you feel
oh it's getting hot right so that elect
that energy
is being transferred between your hands
you're actually creating some energy
there
because of the friction and you're
heating up your hands
and that's why when it's cold outside
right and especially if somebody doesn't
have any gloves on
they'll rub their hands together to make
them warm
okay so of course wear gloves if it's a
cold day
but if you don't you can rub your hands
together to make
them warm
next we have ice cube that is the that's
like the opposite
of rubbing your hands together is
holding a bunch of ice
in your hands now ice cube is a small
block of ice a cube
is like a little box right
i'm not a very good artist but let me
draw very quickly this
is a oops see i'm not a very good artist
that's a cube right and of course when
you make ice you
usually pour water into a plant piece of
plastic or metal
that makes the water freeze in these
small shapes
we call those ice cubes so they can
easily put them into your drink
so you can have nice cold iced tea for
example
or just ice water you put it into a
drink
to make it cold because iced tea
is not very good when it's warm i mean
that's that's a different kind of tea
that's warm tea that's not iced tea
so if you want to enjoy cold iced tea or
lemonade or just
water on a hot summer day put some ice
in it
it makes it cold and it's very
refreshing that's an
ice cube but don't hold ice like that
when it's winter or cold outside that's
not a good idea
okay in the summertime not the winter
okay so those are our words for the
vocabulary section
let's talk about the first main idea of
this lesson and that is
how heat is created and we've already
talked about a couple of different
ways during the vocabulary section for
example
the first picture here we saw that when
we were talking about
friction by rubbing two things together
you can create heat by the way this is
how
people a long time ago used to make
fire right they would rub a small piece
of
hard wood stick against uh
another piece of wood they put little
like shavings or maybe hair
down below so that that heat would turn
into fire
and it would catch those things on fire
very quickly that's how they made fire a
long time ago
they had rubbed two sticks together very
quickly
and that friction created heat and if
it's hot enough
and if you had something that caught
fire very easily
you can make a fire that way so that's
one way
by rubbing two things together whether
it's your hands or
two pieces of wood interesting another
way that heat is created of course is by
the sun
everybody knows that if you're cold if
you feel a little cold on a spring or a
fall day
and it's a sunny day just go out in the
sun sit in the sun for a while
and you will warm up another way that
you create heat is by using
electricity remember i said be careful
don't touch the light bulb
if the light has been on for a while
because it's hot you might hurt your
fingers
modern light bulbs are are not so hot
but the old-fashioned ones yeah they get
hot
because and of course you have electric
stoves
those can also create heat
and finally when we talked about natural
gas right
here natural gas if you burn it
you create heat of course you can also
burn oil and you can also burn
wood right i talked about that in the
friction rubbing two pieces of stick
together
then you start to burn wood and you
create heat so there's a lot of
different sources
for heat how heat is created
the second idea is how heat moves so you
create heat
but how do you move that heat from one
source to another
and there's many reasons why you would
do that of course for cooking
for staying warm for doing different
things
so first of all remember we need a
couple of things
for moving heat first of all we need a
conductor
we talked about conductor in the
vocabulary section a conductor is a
material
which allows heat or electricity to pass
through it very quickly
now we didn't see in the vocabulary the
opposite
the opposite of conductor what is the
opposite of a conductor
that is an insulator
insulator insulate
that's a verb insulate means to protect
something
right to keep it away from another thing
so an
insulator is something that does
not conduct heat or electricity well
for example wood wood does not conduct
heat very well if you put hot soup into
a wooden bowl
especially the wood is thick you can
touch the outside of the bowl
and no problem it won't be hot the soup
inside the bowl may be very very hot you
have to be careful
uh eating it because it's too hot you
have to cool it down
but but you can hold that bowl no
problem because it's made of wood
and the heat does not pass through the
wood very easily
wood is an insulator plastic
is also another insulator of course you
should have
thick heavy plastic if you put something
hot
into the plastic bowl but plastic does
not conduct
heat or electricity very well
of course it will burn if it gets too
hot but it does not
conduct that energy very well
so as we saw before metal is a good
conductor
a conductor is a material that heat
moves through easily we talked about
that
an insulator the opposite of a conductor
is a material that heat does not
move through easily some materials such
as wood
plastic wool and fur
are insulators fur is a good example
right your pet cat or dog
has a lot of fur on their body because
they want to keep
warm when it's cold fur helps insulate
your pet from cold temperatures and a
lot of animals have fur
to protect themselves from cold
temperatures especially
in the winter okay so we have conductors
energy moves through those easily and we
have insulators
energy does not move through them easily
okay good
okay let's take a look at the reading
passage now as usually i will read it
out loud
please practice along with me repeat
after me
out loud or in your mind focus on the
vocabulary items
and any new words that we run across
let's begin
heat is energy heat
comes from many sources
heat moves from warmer areas
to cooler areas if you rub your hands
together
they get warm because of
friction friction is a source
of heat
light from the sun is energy
it heats things and makes them warm
a light bulb uses electricity
to create light
heat is also created
when natural gas burns heat
is created we use natural gas
to heat things like water
heat can change matter
if you heat an ice cube it will
melt it goes from being a solid
to a liquid heat can
cook food we cook food
in a metal pot on a stove
metals are good conductors
of heat heat moves from the stove
to the food easily plastic
is not a good conductor of heat
that is why most pots have a plastic
handle okay that's the reading section
and of course that's a good point right
most pots have a plastic handle
because if it was a metal handle heat
conduct a metal conducts heat very
easily so if you grab that metal handle
ouch that'd be hot but if you wrap that
handle in plastic
then it protects your hand because the
heat doesn't go through the plastic very
well
that's a good use of plastic as an
insulator
okay good okay so
how is the information in this reading
passage organized here we have
the skill classified classified means to
put things into certain categories or
groups
to classify them so in this case we have
a topic sentence right a general
sentence that says
heat comes from many sources and that's
a very
typical topic sentence for a passage a
reading passage
that uses classified because many
sources
well let's classify those sources let's
put those different sources into
different
groups that's classification so heat
comes from many sources
what is the first source or the first
classification
we have friction that is one of the
sources of heat
so friction when you beep your hands
together
they get warm what do you do we talked
about this especially in the winter time
right
you want to make your hands warm well
you rub
your hands together when you rub
your hands together they get warm so rub
means to you know
push one object against another object
back and forth to make friction to make
heat to make
warmth the next source
for heat is sunlight right
sunlight what does sunlight do if you
put something out in the sun
what happens to it it gets hot right so
sunlight
it heats things
it heats things and of course makes them
warm
if you heat something of course it's the
same thing as saying
it makes it warm so you can heat things
and make them warm by the way i talked
about iced tea before that's a good way
to make iced tea right you have water
in a glass jar you put some tea bags
into the
um into the jar put the cap on put it
out in the sun
after a few hours the heat of the sun
will
make the tea and the tea bags go through
all the water because it gets hot and so
the tea
spreads out through the water again they
put a little sugar in it and then you
got iced tea
very good good for the summertime okay
and put some ice cubes in it right okay
after that because you don't want to
drink hot iced tea
okay anyway not on a hot summer day
anyway okay
the last source is natural gas and we
talked about that there are pockets
of talk about pockets but big pockets
large areas underground that have
natural gas
they are a little bit dangerous right
but the gas can come up to the ground
especially if you drill down to it
and and companies will will tap into
that natural gas and they'll get it
so natural gas does what it how do you
get the heat from the natural gas
right if the gas just escapes right
there's no heat it just
comes out in the air and it kind of
dissolves into the air
but if you uh if you
put fire to it right it will burn
so natural gas it burns
and heat is created now of course
natural gas
burns very quickly and very easily
and of course you might have it in your
home and your stove
don't play with natural gas it's very
dangerous
but it burns very quickly heat is
created
and you we use it for cooking all the
time
on our stoves in our kitchens
okay so those are three different
sources of heat
of course there's many other sources of
heat but in the reading passage we were
talking about three main
sources of heat so this is classified
heat comes from many sources
what are three of those sources boom
boom boom friction sunlight natural gas
there of course there are other sources
as well but these are the three
mentioned
in the reading passage okay so that's
our lesson for today
we're taking a look a scientific look at
how
heat is created and also how heat moves
using conductors or insulators to
protect
against too much heat or too much
electricity
okay so that's our lesson for today
thanks for studying with me i hope to
see in the next one
take care everybody bye bye
you

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:11
textbook reading
00:12
my name is brian stewart and in this
00:14
lesson we're looking at science book
00:16
for lesson 14
00:19
and the title of the lesson is sources
00:22
of heat i hope you're warm if you are
00:26
warm
00:26
how are you warm where is your heat
00:28
coming from are you
00:30
are is it coming from the sun is it
00:32
coming from
00:33
the heater in your house interesting
00:36
question
00:37
in this lesson we will be taking a look
00:39
at two main ideas
00:40
one idea is how heat is created
00:44
and the second idea is how heat moves
00:48
okay let's begin the first word in the
00:51
vocabulary section
00:53
is natural gas
00:56
natural gas is a gas which is burned
00:59
for energy natural gas is an interesting
01:03
word i mean
01:04
we know what gas is gas is what you put
01:06
in your car
01:07
right to make your car run but
01:10
what's natural gas isn't all gas natural
01:13
no it's not because the gas that you put
01:15
in your car really isn't natural it is
01:19
uh taken from oil run through a factory
01:23
that produces gas that you put in your
01:25
car however
01:27
deep underground there are pockets of
01:31
gas and when we talk about gas i'm not
01:32
talking about the liquid gas
01:34
that you put in your car i'm talking
01:36
about a gas like
01:38
air it's it's like air and it's trapped
01:41
underground
01:42
and it burns because of the uh the
01:45
chemical
01:46
composition it can burn very quickly in
01:49
fact it's kind of dangerous
01:50
because it can explode and you might
01:53
you probably have natural gas in your
01:55
home when you turn on your stove
01:58
right you can smell actually that smell
02:00
is added to it
02:01
but you can smell the gas coming from
02:03
your stove and then
02:04
you click on it and then it it makes a
02:07
flame and
02:08
your mom or your dad cooks food
02:11
on the stove don't play with your stove
02:13
of course i don't mean to encourage that
02:15
but that's an example of natural gas in
02:18
your home
02:18
and sometimes we have to be careful
02:20
about that because it can be dangerous
02:22
so don't play with that but that's an
02:24
example of natural
02:26
gas and it burns very easily
02:29
okay next is the stove i just
02:33
explained about natural gas you see
02:37
the fire here it's a blue flame
02:40
that what's burning that is the natural
02:43
gas
02:43
i was just talking about and of course
02:45
it's on your stove
02:46
stove is a device that makes heat
02:50
for cooking now many stoves are natural
02:53
gas stoves you could also have electric
02:55
stoves that just use an electric coil
02:58
to make heat but most stoves will use
03:02
natural gas
03:03
my wife likes to cook with natural gas
03:05
she likes it better than electric
03:06
but and it's it's quicker and it's uh
03:09
it's much more efficient but uh yeah
03:12
many many homes will have natural gas
03:14
stoves
03:15
for cooking it's a very easy way to cook
03:18
something in your kitchen
03:21
light bulb light bulb is a different
03:24
type of device of course it
03:26
doesn't use natural gas it uses
03:29
electricity to make light
03:32
and it also makes heat right so be
03:34
careful if the light bulb has been on
03:36
for a while
03:36
don't touch it it's hot of course new
03:39
modern light bulbs
03:40
stay cool but the older light bulbs they
03:43
get hot
03:44
so they make light they can also make
03:46
heat but that is a
03:48
light bulb by the way bulb
03:51
is what you call this especially this
03:54
shape
03:54
right that is a bulb and of course
03:57
because it makes light it is a light
03:59
bulb next we have
04:02
conductor conductor now you could use
04:06
conductor
04:07
means different things for different
04:09
situations if you go to see a concert
04:11
you see a man or a woman standing in
04:13
front of all the people playing their
04:15
instruments
04:16
and they're waving their hands like this
04:17
that is a conductor
04:19
that's a different kind of conductor the
04:21
conductor here
04:22
is a substance a material that
04:25
allows electricity or heat to travel
04:29
through it easily so if you look at
04:33
these what's the picture of the pictures
04:35
is of a bunch of pots
04:38
and pans right those are pans pans are
04:41
shallow
04:42
they're on the bottom the pots are deep
04:45
they're on the top
04:46
so pots and pans they're made out of
04:48
metal
04:49
why because metal is a substance
04:53
that allows electricity or heat in this
04:56
case
04:56
heat to travel through it quickly so if
04:59
you put
05:00
a metal pot onto your stove the heat
05:03
from the natural gas will pass through
05:06
the metal
05:07
to the food and it will cook quickly
05:10
if you used a different material other
05:13
than
05:13
metal the heat maybe wouldn't pass
05:16
through and your food would stay cold
05:18
or the material would burn depending on
05:21
the material right
05:22
but metal is a good conductor it allows
05:24
heat
05:25
and electricity to pass through it very
05:28
easily
05:29
copper is a good conductor of
05:32
electricity
05:33
so in the wires in your home they're
05:35
made of copper we
05:36
talked about this in a previous lesson
05:38
because electricity can pass through
05:40
copper
05:41
very easily okay so
05:44
a substance that allows heat or
05:47
electricity to pass through it
05:49
is a conductor okay and like i said you
05:52
can talk about different conductors like
05:54
the person in front of a band or the
05:56
person
05:57
who drives a train uh they're a
05:59
conductor
06:00
uh person who checks your tickets on the
06:02
train but in this case we're talking
06:04
about a substance that allows heat or
06:06
electricity
06:07
to pass through it quickly that is a
06:09
conductor
06:11
next we have friction we talked about
06:13
friction in a previous lesson
06:15
when we were talking about forces moving
06:18
across
06:19
different types of surfaces of course
06:21
friction
06:22
is the force that occurs when you rub
06:26
one object against another and when you
06:28
have friction right you're losing energy
06:31
but actually when you lose energy that
06:33
the energy is getting transferred
06:35
from one object to another and when that
06:39
energy gets
06:40
transferred what happens rub your hands
06:42
together what do you feel you feel
06:44
oh it's getting hot right so that elect
06:47
that energy
06:48
is being transferred between your hands
06:51
you're actually creating some energy
06:53
there
06:53
because of the friction and you're
06:55
heating up your hands
06:56
and that's why when it's cold outside
06:58
right and especially if somebody doesn't
07:00
have any gloves on
07:01
they'll rub their hands together to make
07:04
them warm
07:05
okay so of course wear gloves if it's a
07:08
cold day
07:08
but if you don't you can rub your hands
07:10
together to make
07:11
them warm
07:14
next we have ice cube that is the that's
07:17
like the opposite
07:18
of rubbing your hands together is
07:20
holding a bunch of ice
07:22
in your hands now ice cube is a small
07:26
block of ice a cube
07:29
is like a little box right
07:32
i'm not a very good artist but let me
07:34
draw very quickly this
07:35
is a oops see i'm not a very good artist
07:40
that's a cube right and of course when
07:42
you make ice you
07:43
usually pour water into a plant piece of
07:46
plastic or metal
07:47
that makes the water freeze in these
07:50
small shapes
07:51
we call those ice cubes so they can
07:53
easily put them into your drink
07:55
so you can have nice cold iced tea for
07:57
example
07:58
or just ice water you put it into a
08:01
drink
08:01
to make it cold because iced tea
08:06
is not very good when it's warm i mean
08:08
that's that's a different kind of tea
08:09
that's warm tea that's not iced tea
08:10
so if you want to enjoy cold iced tea or
08:14
lemonade or just
08:15
water on a hot summer day put some ice
08:18
in it
08:18
it makes it cold and it's very
08:20
refreshing that's an
08:21
ice cube but don't hold ice like that
08:24
when it's winter or cold outside that's
08:26
not a good idea
08:28
okay in the summertime not the winter
08:30
okay so those are our words for the
08:32
vocabulary section
08:36
let's talk about the first main idea of
08:39
this lesson and that is
08:40
how heat is created and we've already
08:43
talked about a couple of different
08:46
ways during the vocabulary section for
08:48
example
08:49
the first picture here we saw that when
08:51
we were talking about
08:53
friction by rubbing two things together
08:56
you can create heat by the way this is
08:59
how
08:59
people a long time ago used to make
09:02
fire right they would rub a small piece
09:06
of
09:06
hard wood stick against uh
09:10
another piece of wood they put little
09:12
like shavings or maybe hair
09:14
down below so that that heat would turn
09:16
into fire
09:17
and it would catch those things on fire
09:19
very quickly that's how they made fire a
09:21
long time ago
09:22
they had rubbed two sticks together very
09:25
quickly
09:25
and that friction created heat and if
09:28
it's hot enough
09:29
and if you had something that caught
09:31
fire very easily
09:32
you can make a fire that way so that's
09:34
one way
09:35
by rubbing two things together whether
09:37
it's your hands or
09:38
two pieces of wood interesting another
09:41
way that heat is created of course is by
09:43
the sun
09:44
everybody knows that if you're cold if
09:47
you feel a little cold on a spring or a
09:49
fall day
09:50
and it's a sunny day just go out in the
09:52
sun sit in the sun for a while
09:53
and you will warm up another way that
09:57
you create heat is by using
09:59
electricity remember i said be careful
10:01
don't touch the light bulb
10:03
if the light has been on for a while
10:05
because it's hot you might hurt your
10:07
fingers
10:08
modern light bulbs are are not so hot
10:10
but the old-fashioned ones yeah they get
10:12
hot
10:13
because and of course you have electric
10:15
stoves
10:16
those can also create heat
10:20
and finally when we talked about natural
10:22
gas right
10:23
here natural gas if you burn it
10:26
you create heat of course you can also
10:28
burn oil and you can also burn
10:31
wood right i talked about that in the
10:32
friction rubbing two pieces of stick
10:34
together
10:35
then you start to burn wood and you
10:37
create heat so there's a lot of
10:38
different sources
10:40
for heat how heat is created
10:45
the second idea is how heat moves so you
10:48
create heat
10:49
but how do you move that heat from one
10:51
source to another
10:53
and there's many reasons why you would
10:55
do that of course for cooking
10:56
for staying warm for doing different
10:59
things
11:00
so first of all remember we need a
11:02
couple of things
11:03
for moving heat first of all we need a
11:06
conductor
11:07
we talked about conductor in the
11:09
vocabulary section a conductor is a
11:11
material
11:12
which allows heat or electricity to pass
11:15
through it very quickly
11:17
now we didn't see in the vocabulary the
11:19
opposite
11:20
the opposite of conductor what is the
11:23
opposite of a conductor
11:24
that is an insulator
11:28
insulator insulate
11:31
that's a verb insulate means to protect
11:34
something
11:35
right to keep it away from another thing
11:37
so an
11:38
insulator is something that does
11:41
not conduct heat or electricity well
11:45
for example wood wood does not conduct
11:48
heat very well if you put hot soup into
11:51
a wooden bowl
11:53
especially the wood is thick you can
11:56
touch the outside of the bowl
11:58
and no problem it won't be hot the soup
12:00
inside the bowl may be very very hot you
12:02
have to be careful
12:04
uh eating it because it's too hot you
12:06
have to cool it down
12:08
but but you can hold that bowl no
12:11
problem because it's made of wood
12:12
and the heat does not pass through the
12:14
wood very easily
12:16
wood is an insulator plastic
12:19
is also another insulator of course you
12:22
should have
12:23
thick heavy plastic if you put something
12:26
hot
12:26
into the plastic bowl but plastic does
12:28
not conduct
12:30
heat or electricity very well
12:33
of course it will burn if it gets too
12:35
hot but it does not
12:36
conduct that energy very well
12:40
so as we saw before metal is a good
12:42
conductor
12:43
a conductor is a material that heat
12:45
moves through easily we talked about
12:47
that
12:48
an insulator the opposite of a conductor
12:51
is a material that heat does not
12:54
move through easily some materials such
12:57
as wood
12:58
plastic wool and fur
13:02
are insulators fur is a good example
13:05
right your pet cat or dog
13:08
has a lot of fur on their body because
13:11
they want to keep
13:12
warm when it's cold fur helps insulate
13:16
your pet from cold temperatures and a
13:19
lot of animals have fur
13:21
to protect themselves from cold
13:23
temperatures especially
13:25
in the winter okay so we have conductors
13:29
energy moves through those easily and we
13:31
have insulators
13:33
energy does not move through them easily
13:37
okay good
13:40
okay let's take a look at the reading
13:41
passage now as usually i will read it
13:44
out loud
13:45
please practice along with me repeat
13:48
after me
13:48
out loud or in your mind focus on the
13:51
vocabulary items
13:52
and any new words that we run across
13:55
let's begin
13:57
heat is energy heat
14:00
comes from many sources
14:04
heat moves from warmer areas
14:07
to cooler areas if you rub your hands
14:12
together
14:13
they get warm because of
14:16
friction friction is a source
14:20
of heat
14:24
light from the sun is energy
14:28
it heats things and makes them warm
14:32
a light bulb uses electricity
14:36
to create light
14:39
heat is also created
14:43
when natural gas burns heat
14:46
is created we use natural gas
14:50
to heat things like water
14:56
heat can change matter
14:59
if you heat an ice cube it will
15:03
melt it goes from being a solid
15:08
to a liquid heat can
15:11
cook food we cook food
15:15
in a metal pot on a stove
15:20
metals are good conductors
15:23
of heat heat moves from the stove
15:28
to the food easily plastic
15:32
is not a good conductor of heat
15:36
that is why most pots have a plastic
15:40
handle okay that's the reading section
15:44
and of course that's a good point right
15:46
most pots have a plastic handle
15:48
because if it was a metal handle heat
15:51
conduct a metal conducts heat very
15:53
easily so if you grab that metal handle
15:56
ouch that'd be hot but if you wrap that
15:58
handle in plastic
16:00
then it protects your hand because the
16:02
heat doesn't go through the plastic very
16:04
well
16:05
that's a good use of plastic as an
16:07
insulator
16:08
okay good okay so
16:12
how is the information in this reading
16:14
passage organized here we have
16:16
the skill classified classified means to
16:20
put things into certain categories or
16:22
groups
16:23
to classify them so in this case we have
16:27
a topic sentence right a general
16:30
sentence that says
16:31
heat comes from many sources and that's
16:34
a very
16:34
typical topic sentence for a passage a
16:37
reading passage
16:38
that uses classified because many
16:41
sources
16:41
well let's classify those sources let's
16:44
put those different sources into
16:46
different
16:46
groups that's classification so heat
16:50
comes from many sources
16:52
what is the first source or the first
16:54
classification
16:55
we have friction that is one of the
16:57
sources of heat
16:59
so friction when you beep your hands
17:02
together
17:02
they get warm what do you do we talked
17:04
about this especially in the winter time
17:06
right
17:07
you want to make your hands warm well
17:09
you rub
17:10
your hands together when you rub
17:14
your hands together they get warm so rub
17:17
means to you know
17:19
push one object against another object
17:22
back and forth to make friction to make
17:25
heat to make
17:25
warmth the next source
17:29
for heat is sunlight right
17:32
sunlight what does sunlight do if you
17:34
put something out in the sun
17:35
what happens to it it gets hot right so
17:38
sunlight
17:39
it heats things
17:42
it heats things and of course makes them
17:46
warm
17:46
if you heat something of course it's the
17:48
same thing as saying
17:49
it makes it warm so you can heat things
17:52
and make them warm by the way i talked
17:54
about iced tea before that's a good way
17:56
to make iced tea right you have water
17:58
in a glass jar you put some tea bags
18:01
into the
18:01
um into the jar put the cap on put it
18:04
out in the sun
18:05
after a few hours the heat of the sun
18:08
will
18:08
make the tea and the tea bags go through
18:11
all the water because it gets hot and so
18:13
the tea
18:14
spreads out through the water again they
18:16
put a little sugar in it and then you
18:17
got iced tea
18:18
very good good for the summertime okay
18:21
and put some ice cubes in it right okay
18:23
after that because you don't want to
18:24
drink hot iced tea
18:25
okay anyway not on a hot summer day
18:27
anyway okay
18:28
the last source is natural gas and we
18:31
talked about that there are pockets
18:33
of talk about pockets but big pockets
18:36
large areas underground that have
18:39
natural gas
18:40
they are a little bit dangerous right
18:42
but the gas can come up to the ground
18:45
especially if you drill down to it
18:46
and and companies will will tap into
18:48
that natural gas and they'll get it
18:51
so natural gas does what it how do you
18:54
get the heat from the natural gas
18:56
right if the gas just escapes right
18:58
there's no heat it just
19:00
comes out in the air and it kind of
19:01
dissolves into the air
19:03
but if you uh if you
19:07
put fire to it right it will burn
19:10
so natural gas it burns
19:14
and heat is created now of course
19:16
natural gas
19:17
burns very quickly and very easily
19:20
and of course you might have it in your
19:22
home and your stove
19:24
don't play with natural gas it's very
19:27
dangerous
19:28
but it burns very quickly heat is
19:30
created
19:31
and you we use it for cooking all the
19:33
time
19:34
on our stoves in our kitchens
19:37
okay so those are three different
19:39
sources of heat
19:40
of course there's many other sources of
19:42
heat but in the reading passage we were
19:44
talking about three main
19:46
sources of heat so this is classified
19:48
heat comes from many sources
19:49
what are three of those sources boom
19:52
boom boom friction sunlight natural gas
19:54
there of course there are other sources
19:56
as well but these are the three
19:58
mentioned
19:58
in the reading passage okay so that's
20:01
our lesson for today
20:02
we're taking a look a scientific look at
20:05
how
20:06
heat is created and also how heat moves
20:09
using conductors or insulators to
20:11
protect
20:12
against too much heat or too much
20:15
electricity
20:16
okay so that's our lesson for today
20:18
thanks for studying with me i hope to
20:19
see in the next one
20:20
take care everybody bye bye
20:42
you
