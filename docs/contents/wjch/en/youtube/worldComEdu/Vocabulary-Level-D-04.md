hello everybody
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
are you ready to continue talking about
our subject of sports
well we're on lesson four the human
machine
the human machine it's like people are
machines right
think about some famous athletes that
you know
right like park ji sang or or pak taiwan
right the swimmer they're like machines
in the water or on the soccer field
right
how do they get to be such strong
athletes that's what we're going to
focus on
how can someone become a great athlete
well of course it's going to take a lot
of hard work right but
in the reading passage we'll take a look
at how
someone becomes a great athlete and if
you want to become a great athlete
what can you do to become a great
athlete so we're going to take a look at
that
but first as always let's take a look at
the vocabulary
so our first vocabulary word is
someone who plays a sport we just talked
about that right
how can someone become a great what what
is this person
she is running she is an athlete
she is an athlete okay so pronunciation
athlete if you compete in a sport
and that's like your not just your hobby
but also sometimes your job
you're an athlete if you play sports
well and you do it a lot
okay the ability to do something
the ability to do something like if you
have the ability to create such a
beautiful sand castle
right we can say you have a lot of skill
of course athletes need skill right
but also many other types of people need
skill artists
need skill engineers need skill
lawyers need skill skill is something
it's an ability that you develop either
through training
through practice through study but it's
a skill
what kind of skills do you have for
example
okay number three here's a signpost
right the measure of a space between
two things right buenos aires is 7 270
kilometers
that way so when we measure the space
between two things we're talking about
the distance how far something
is away so from me to buenos aires
or me to busan right what is the
distance
how many kilometers or how many miles
right okay next one
after some time so when we look at this
what is this by the way this is a
tad pole now
later on this tadpole we know maybe you
know what will it become
it will become a frog right river
okay so but it will take some time
eventually
eventually means after a certain amount
of time
usually kind of like a long time this
tadpole is not going to become a frog
right away it's going to take some time
eventually
the tadpole will become a frog
eventually
young children will grow up to be adults
it'll take some time
but eventually it will happen after some
time
okay number five repeating something so
you get
better at it now your english teacher
probably
always tells you this what do they say
they say practice
practice practice okay it's not just
english
piano right if you're learning to play
a musical instrument whether it's a
piano
a trumpet or whatever you have to
practice if you're playing a sport and
you want to get better at it what do you
do
you practice so any skill remember we
talked about skills
skills our abilities how do you improve
your ability you practice whatever it is
you practice you get better at it so do
it again and again
repeating it so that you get better at
it
okay next one number six equal
and even if something is equal and even
we say
it is balanced right it is perfectly
balanced
because it's equal and it is even on
both sides it's
balanced sometimes well a little bit
different idea we can also say it's
fair if two teams two soccer teams are
playing
one team has 12 players the other team
has eight
players it's not balanced it's not fair
so both teams have to have 11 players
and that's a balanced team that is a
fair competition okay next one seven
done all the way so if something is
um finished or if all the
things are in place we say that it is
complete it
or something is done all the way
something is finished a process
you can think about complete in
different ways
in this case we're thinking all the
tools are in a sets
or everything is together it's complete
but you can also think about
a painting when the painting is finished
we say it is
complete it's finished okay
eight now this is very interesting isn't
it this is from this is how
a butterfly comes out of the cocoon
remember before it was a caterpillar
so a caterpillar changes into a new
state
into a butterfly what do we say we say
becomes a caterpillar becomes
a butterfly a caterpillar becomes a
butterfly
a child becomes an adult
a tadpole becomes a frog
and become is an irregular verb so we
say become
became become okay become
became become it's interesting that this
is the same as the present tense right
the past perfect okay
next one nine there are many books here
italy turkey beijing mexico india what
are these books about
they tell you how to do something they
tell you
how to travel through italy they tell
you how to
travel through mexico what is it it is a
guide
these books are guides to different
cities
but a guide can be many different things
a guide can be a book
a guide can be a person right if you're
on a tour
there's a tour guide who tells you and
shows you the different places
and how to look at them or or how to
think sometimes about these places
or what to know so a guide can be many
different types of things
it shows you how to do something a guide
could also be an instruction manual
you get a computer and you need to how
do i you know hook up all the cables
you look at the guide okay
ten oh very famous right vitamin water
don't say bitumen that's konglish
vitamin
vitamin water do you drink it sometimes

i like this one here okay that's my
favorite anyway
an important mineral for your body
because these
products have vitamins which are
minerals for your bodies vitamin i just

here
vitamin water say vitamin not
beta min that's wrong vitamin
vitamin okay that's the pronunciation
for an important mineral

vitamin
e right so all these different vitamins
help your body do different things very
important for you
number 11 this is not so important for
you
we like it it's delicious but
unfortunately
it's not important for our bodies having
a lot of sugar
is sugary a lot of candy and this is
like
gummy gummy candy of course it's very
sugary
uh chocolate has a lot of sugar in it um
hard candy all very sugary
treats and snacks so be careful of those
our body doesn't need them
it's not a very important for our body
especially our teeth
got to be careful just mail okay next
one 12
happening many times over a time period
if you're using a computer
you're probably hitting certain keys
again and again
you're hitting them very often so you
hit certain keys
very often like the enter key or the
space bar you hit that
very often okay next one
oh what is he he's a juggler right to
throw and catch
many things at once we say juggle
this is the verb to juggle he is
juggling we can call him what is his
name he is a
juggler right the person is a juggler
if he's doing it we say he is a juggler
what is he doing
he is juggling to juggle
is the verb okay to throw and catch many
things
at once can you juggle can you do that
if you want to develop that skill that
ability you have to practice
okay next one 14. yay that looks like
fun can you water ski maybe you go to
kapyong
kapyong yeah gap young and you go water
skiing i used to do that a long time ago
but my friends who do that they all left
that's sad
if you want to go water skiing call me
okay i'm just kidding okay
very amazing right very amazing if he
can do that
incredible wow really incredible amazing
so if you he can do this if he can jump
wow that's incredible amazing right okay
next one
this is also incredible and amazing
right very incredible costumes a special
happening
something special that happens we call
it an
event okay for example the olympics
every four years
that is an event sometimes there will be
a festival
in different cities in venice or new
orleans
they will be events right a parade in
seoul
is an event any thing that happens it's
special
it's an event there's so many events
happening all the time
even in seoul even in in your in your
town probably there are many
events last one number 16 the ability to
do difficult things
can you believe it can he is it real is
it true
i think it's trick photography unless
maybe he's bruce willis then it's true
no i'm just kidding
the ability to do difficult things
strength
if somebody has a lot of strength they
have the ability to do
difficult things i don't think this this
is real it's a trick photography
but think about it if you can lift a lot
of things if you can pick up a very
heavy weight
you have a lot of strength
okay so those are the words we need to
know for the reading
let's make sure we remember those words
let's take a little short quiz on some
of those words
choose the word that best completes the
sentence here are the words
we need to fill in the blanks with the
best word okay
number one you need to beep your english
if you want to get better we talked
about this
it's not just english it could be
practicing a musical instrument
like the piano the trumpet or whatever
what do you need to do do you need to
define
do you need to become do you need to
practice or do you need to skill
well skill right away we see that's a
noun that doesn't make sense
define become practice those are verbs
and they would fit
with two right two we need a verb but
define become practice if you want to
get better at something you need to do
it again and again
you need to practice right you need to
practice your english if you want to get
better
you need to practice playing soccer if
you want to get better at playing soccer
you need to practice playing the piano
if you want to be a better
piano player okay so practice you need
to do something
you need to practice if you want to get
better okay number two
i need to beep my homework before i can
go to the movies
i need to what my homework what do you
do with your homework that you want to
do
you want to get it done right so do you
want to put your homework do you want to
become
you want to become my homegirl i want to
become a book that's crazy
i want to drop my homework or i want to
complete my homework what makes sense
well obviously if you looked at complete
that's the one that makes sense
complete means finish i want to complete
my homework i want to
finish my homework before i can go to
the movies not put
not become and not drop
you know drop your homework let's see
let's go upstairs and drop it from the
roof now don't do that
okay that's not a good idea you want to
complete your homework
before you can go to the movies okay
next one
three you're so good at baseball
basketball well baseball sorry baseball
you're so good that means ah chale right
you're so
good at it right you should be a
professional what
if a person plays a sport especially for
their job
they get paid for it they are
professional
and they are playing a sport and they're
getting paid for it
what do we call that job doctor lawyer
engineer or what
skill train athlete event which one of
these words
is a description of an actual job well
of course c
an athlete is a description of a
particular job
an athlete is someone who plays a sport
a professional
athlete is someone who plays a sport and
gets
money for it right you think about it
that's crazy
right somebody gets paid for throwing a
ball or running fast
well in our society it's true people
some people get paid
a lot of money to uh to
to play these games like for example
think of tiger woods
he gets millions of dollars for playing
golf
sounds like a dream job right of course
they have a lot of talent
they have a lot of skill and they've
worked very hard to
attain that skill okay number four
in a few days the seed will beep a plant
so again a seed of course is like an
apple seed
or some other part of the plant that you
put in the ground
and then after a while it eventually
grows into a plant right
so first you have a seed later you have
a plant
right what happens to the seed it what
it completes it becomes it eventually
or it guides of course we know the
answer oops
the answer is become in a few days the
seed will become
a plant so it will change from one thing
to another thing it will become a plant
okay so
let's move on to number five that
beep is too great no one could ever swim
that far okay so we we kind of know the
answer right here if you're looking at
wow there's an
island out there be careful it's very
far away
right that what is too great that event
that guide that incredible or that
distance
is too great remember the the
measurement from
point a here to point b over there
we're talking about distance so we say
that distance is too great the distance
is too great
no one could ever swim that far
the distance is too great so the right
answer is distance
six your english beep has improved a lot
all that practice has paid off so
again we're kind of talking about that
idea again practice you practice
something a lot
to improve what do you want to improve
you improve your ability at something
what is ability
skill repeat grow or learn
did you say skill then you would be
correct
because skill is ability you practice
a skill to become better at it your
english skill has improved a lot
all that practice has paid off
practice has paid off means you
practiced a lot
so you got the reward you were
successful
right if something is successful it has
paid
off you were successful okay number
seven
beep i will usu i will start eating
better
just not right now so not right now
not now some other time
later what mean what does that mean what
what
mean what what word within the blank a
usually i will start eating better
usually i will start eating better
that doesn't make sense because usually
is for
things that happen habitually so we
don't use future tense with usually
completely i will start eating better
that doesn't make sense
suddenly i will start eating better
that's isaan hail
eventually ah eventually not right now
but later
so eventually is the answer eventually
not now but after some time
eventually i will start eating better a
lot of us we
sometimes lazy so we say eventually i'll
do it i'll do it eventually
okay but not right now okay maybe you
should start right now if you want to do
something do it now
don't wait for eventually do it now
okay eight a or and beep meal will keep
you healthy
we talk about eating we have to eat uh
certain
things right a different things we have
to eat a certain amount of carbohydrates
or bread and potatoes and rice
right we have to eat a certain amount of
protein like in meat
we have to eat a certain amount of we
have to drink a certain amount of other
things like
milk or cheese dairy products okay so we
have to make sure we eat all these
things
and in the right parts right so
what kind of meal should we have all
meat no
we need meat vegetables something to
drink uh you know
we need a a what kind of meal a balanced
meal a sugary meal
an exercise meal or an energy meal
well right away we know sugary meal will
not keep us healthy that's got too much
sugar in it
an exercise meal doesn't make sense
because
we're looking for an adjective right
something to modify meal
exercise is not an adjective and energy
is an adjective an
energy meal but that doesn't sound right
that doesn't make sense
what we're looking for is balanced a
balanced meal
a balanced meal has the right amount of
each food
group and you eat it and it's good for
you because it's balanced
you get enough protein you get
carbohydrates
you get enough vitamins and minerals
it's a balanced meal
and it keeps you healthy not too much
sugar right maybe a little sugar is okay
but not too much you need to eat the
things in balance
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
section let's take a short break here
and we'll come back
and look at the reading how to become a
great athlete
so don't go away we'll be right back

well we're on lesson four the human
00:19
machine
00:20
the human machine it's like people are
00:23
machines right
00:24
think about some famous athletes that
00:26
you know
00:27
right like park ji sang or or pak taiwan
00:30
right the swimmer they're like machines
00:33
in the water or on the soccer field
00:35
right
00:36
how do they get to be such strong
00:39
athletes that's what we're going to
00:40
focus on
00:41
how can someone become a great athlete
00:44
well of course it's going to take a lot
00:46
of hard work right but
00:48
in the reading passage we'll take a look
00:50
at how
00:51
someone becomes a great athlete and if
00:53
you want to become a great athlete
00:56
what can you do to become a great
00:58
athlete so we're going to take a look at
01:00
that
01:00
but first as always let's take a look at
01:04
the vocabulary
01:05
so our first vocabulary word is
01:08
someone who plays a sport we just talked
01:12
about that right
01:13
how can someone become a great what what
01:16
is this person
01:17
she is running she is an athlete
01:20
she is an athlete okay so pronunciation
01:23
athlete if you compete in a sport
01:27
and that's like your not just your hobby
01:30
but also sometimes your job
01:31
you're an athlete if you play sports
01:34
well and you do it a lot
01:36
okay the ability to do something
01:39
the ability to do something like if you
01:41
have the ability to create such a
01:43
beautiful sand castle
01:44
right we can say you have a lot of skill
01:49
of course athletes need skill right
01:52
but also many other types of people need
01:54
skill artists
01:56
need skill engineers need skill
01:59
lawyers need skill skill is something
02:03
it's an ability that you develop either
02:06
through training
02:07
through practice through study but it's
02:10
a skill
02:10
what kind of skills do you have for
02:12
example
02:14
okay number three here's a signpost
02:17
right the measure of a space between
02:19
two things right buenos aires is 7 270
02:23
kilometers
02:24
that way so when we measure the space
02:27
between two things we're talking about
02:30
the distance how far something
02:34
is away so from me to buenos aires
02:37
or me to busan right what is the
02:40
distance
02:42
how many kilometers or how many miles
02:45
right okay next one
02:48
after some time so when we look at this
02:51
what is this by the way this is a
02:53
tad pole now
02:56
later on this tadpole we know maybe you
02:59
know what will it become
03:01
it will become a frog right river
03:04
okay so but it will take some time
03:07
eventually
03:08
eventually means after a certain amount
03:11
of time
03:12
usually kind of like a long time this
03:14
tadpole is not going to become a frog
03:17
right away it's going to take some time
03:20
eventually
03:21
the tadpole will become a frog
03:24
eventually
03:25
young children will grow up to be adults
03:28
it'll take some time
03:29
but eventually it will happen after some
03:33
time
03:33
okay number five repeating something so
03:37
you get
03:38
better at it now your english teacher
03:40
probably
03:41
always tells you this what do they say
03:43
they say practice
03:44
practice practice okay it's not just
03:47
english
03:48
piano right if you're learning to play
03:51
a musical instrument whether it's a
03:54
piano
03:55
a trumpet or whatever you have to
03:56
practice if you're playing a sport and
03:59
you want to get better at it what do you
04:01
do
04:01
you practice so any skill remember we
04:04
talked about skills
04:06
skills our abilities how do you improve
04:09
your ability you practice whatever it is
04:12
you practice you get better at it so do
04:14
it again and again
04:16
repeating it so that you get better at
04:18
it
04:19
okay next one number six equal
04:22
and even if something is equal and even
04:25
we say
04:26
it is balanced right it is perfectly
04:28
balanced
04:29
because it's equal and it is even on
04:32
both sides it's
04:33
balanced sometimes well a little bit
04:36
different idea we can also say it's
04:38
fair if two teams two soccer teams are
04:41
playing
04:41
one team has 12 players the other team
04:44
has eight
04:44
players it's not balanced it's not fair
04:48
so both teams have to have 11 players
04:51
and that's a balanced team that is a
04:55
fair competition okay next one seven
04:59
done all the way so if something is
05:03
um finished or if all the
05:06
things are in place we say that it is
05:08
complete it
05:09
or something is done all the way
05:11
something is finished a process
05:13
you can think about complete in
05:15
different ways
05:16
in this case we're thinking all the
05:18
tools are in a sets
05:20
or everything is together it's complete
05:22
but you can also think about
05:24
a painting when the painting is finished
05:26
we say it is
05:27
complete it's finished okay
05:31
eight now this is very interesting isn't
05:34
it this is from this is how
05:36
a butterfly comes out of the cocoon
05:38
remember before it was a caterpillar
05:41
so a caterpillar changes into a new
05:43
state
05:44
into a butterfly what do we say we say
05:47
becomes a caterpillar becomes
05:51
a butterfly a caterpillar becomes a
05:54
butterfly
05:55
a child becomes an adult
05:59
a tadpole becomes a frog
06:02
and become is an irregular verb so we
06:05
say become
06:07
became become okay become
06:10
became become it's interesting that this
06:13
is the same as the present tense right
06:16
the past perfect okay
06:18
next one nine there are many books here
06:21
italy turkey beijing mexico india what

06:45
a guide can be a person right if you're

06:49
there's a tour guide who tells you and
06:51

07:01
different types of things
07:02

the ability to do difficult things
11:09
strength
11:10
if somebody has a lot of strength they
11:11
have the ability to do
11:13
difficult things i don't think this this
11:16
is real it's a trick photography
11:18
but think about it if you can lift a lot
11:20
of things if you can pick up a very
11:22
heavy weight
11:23
you have a lot of strength
11:26
okay so those are the words we need to
11:28
know for the reading
11:29
let's make sure we remember those words
11:31
let's take a little short quiz on some
11:34
of those words
11:35
choose the word that best completes the
11:37
sentence here are the words
11:39
we need to fill in the blanks with the
11:41
best word okay
11:43
number one you need to beep your english

11:59
define
12:01
do you need to become do you need to
12:03
practice or do you need to skill
12:05
well skill right away we see that's a
12:07
noun that doesn't make sense
12:09
define become practice those are verbs
12:12
and they would fit
12:13
with two right two we need a verb but
12:17
define become practice if you want to
12:19
get better at something you need to do
12:21
it again and again
12:22
you need to practice right you need to
12:25
practice your english if you want to get
12:27
better

13:13
complete means finish i want to complete
13:16
my homework i want to
13:17
finish my homework before i can go to
13:19

13:28

13:31
complete your homework
13:32

13:35
next one
13:36
three you're so good at baseball
13:38
basketball well baseball sorry baseball
13:41
you're so good that means ah chale right
13:43
you're so
13:44
good at it right you should be a
13:46
professional what
13:48
if a person plays a sport especially for
13:51
their job
13:52
they get paid for it they are
13:54
professional
13:55
and they are playing a sport and they're
13:58
getting paid for it
14:00
what do we call that job doctor lawyer
14:02
engineer or what
14:04
skill train athlete event which one of
14:07
these words
14:08
is a description of an actual job well
14:11
of course c
14:12
an athlete is a description of a
14:15
particular job
14:16
an athlete is someone who plays a sport
14:19
a professional
14:20
athlete is someone who plays a sport and
14:23
gets
14:23
money for it right you think about it
14:26
that's crazy
14:27
right somebody gets paid for throwing a
14:29
ball or running fast
14:30
well in our society it's true people
14:33
some people get paid
14:34
a lot of money to uh to
14:37
to play these games like for example
14:39
think of tiger woods
14:40
he gets millions of dollars for playing
14:43
golf
14:44
sounds like a dream job right of course
14:46
they have a lot of talent
14:47
they have a lot of skill and they've
14:49
worked very hard to
14:50
attain that skill okay number four
14:54
in a few days the seed will beep a plant
14:57
so again a seed of course is like an
14:59
apple seed
15:00
or some other part of the plant that you
15:04
put in the ground
15:05
and then after a while it eventually
15:07
grows into a plant right
15:09
so first you have a seed later you have
15:12
a plant
15:13
right what happens to the seed it what
15:16
it completes it becomes it eventually
15:19
or it guides of course we know the
15:23
answer oops
15:24
the answer is become in a few days the
15:27
seed will become
15:28
a plant so it will change from one thing
15:32
to another thing it will become a plant
15:34
okay so
15:36
let's move on to number five that
15:39
beep is too great no one could ever swim
15:42
that far okay so we we kind of know the
15:46
answer right here if you're looking at
15:47
wow there's an
15:48
island out there be careful it's very
15:50
far away
15:51
right that what is too great that event
15:54
that guide that incredible or that
15:56
distance
15:58
is too great remember the the
16:00
measurement from
16:01
point a here to point b over there
16:05
we're talking about distance so we say
16:09
that distance is too great the distance
16:11
is too great
16:13
no one could ever swim that far
16:16
the distance is too great so the right
16:18
answer is distance
16:20
six your english beep has improved a lot
16:24
all that practice has paid off so
16:28
again we're kind of talking about that
16:29
idea again practice you practice
16:32
something a lot
16:33
to improve what do you want to improve
16:36
you improve your ability at something
16:38
what is ability
16:40
skill repeat grow or learn
16:43
did you say skill then you would be
16:45
correct
16:46
because skill is ability you practice
16:49
a skill to become better at it your
16:52
english skill has improved a lot
16:54
all that practice has paid off
16:58
practice has paid off means you
17:00
practiced a lot
17:01
so you got the reward you were
17:03
successful
17:05
right if something is successful it has
17:07
paid
17:08
off you were successful okay number
17:11
seven
17:12
beep i will usu i will start eating
17:15
better
17:15
just not right now so not right now
17:19
not now some other time
17:22
later what mean what does that mean what
17:25
what
17:26
mean what what word within the blank a
17:29
usually i will start eating better
17:31
usually i will start eating better
17:32
that doesn't make sense because usually
17:35
is for
17:36
things that happen habitually so we
17:38
don't use future tense with usually
17:40
completely i will start eating better
17:42
that doesn't make sense
17:43
suddenly i will start eating better
17:45
that's isaan hail
17:46
eventually ah eventually not right now
17:49
but later
17:50
so eventually is the answer eventually
17:53
not now but after some time
17:56
eventually i will start eating better a
17:59
lot of us we
18:00
sometimes lazy so we say eventually i'll
18:03
do it i'll do it eventually
18:05
okay but not right now okay maybe you
18:07
should start right now if you want to do
18:09
something do it now
18:10
don't wait for eventually do it now
18:13
okay eight a or and beep meal will keep
18:17
you healthy
18:19
we talk about eating we have to eat uh
18:21
certain
18:22
things right a different things we have
18:24
to eat a certain amount of carbohydrates
18:26
or bread and potatoes and rice
18:29
right we have to eat a certain amount of
18:31
protein like in meat
18:33
we have to eat a certain amount of we
18:35
have to drink a certain amount of other
18:36
things like
18:37
milk or cheese dairy products okay so we
18:40
have to make sure we eat all these
18:41
things
18:42
and in the right parts right so
18:45
what kind of meal should we have all
18:48
meat no
18:48
we need meat vegetables something to
18:51
drink uh you know
18:52
we need a a what kind of meal a balanced
18:54
meal a sugary meal
18:56
an exercise meal or an energy meal
18:59
well right away we know sugary meal will
19:02
not keep us healthy that's got too much
19:04
sugar in it
19:04
an exercise meal doesn't make sense
19:07
because
19:08
we're looking for an adjective right
19:11
something to modify meal
19:12
exercise is not an adjective and energy
19:15
is an adjective an
19:17
energy meal but that doesn't sound right
19:19
that doesn't make sense
19:20
what we're looking for is balanced a
19:22
balanced meal
19:23
a balanced meal has the right amount of
19:25
each food
19:26
group and you eat it and it's good for
19:29
you because it's balanced
19:31
you get enough protein you get
19:32
carbohydrates
19:34
you get enough vitamins and minerals
19:36
it's a balanced meal
19:38
and it keeps you healthy not too much
19:40
sugar right maybe a little sugar is okay
19:42
but not too much you need to eat the
19:44
things in balance
19:45
okay well that wraps up the vocabulary
19:47
section let's take a short break here
19:49
and we'll come back
19:50
and look at the reading how to become a
19:52
great athlete
19:53
so don't go away we'll be right back
20:07
[Music]
20:14
you
