hey everybody
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
i'm brian stewart
we're on lesson seven right now do you
hear that
what do you hear what oh i'm just
kidding that's the name of the lesson
right
do you hear that do you hear that we're
going to focus on
let's learn what sound is
so we're going to study about sound what
exactly
is sound when we talk about things like
sound or sight or
smells that's an area of science
so we're talking about science in this
lesson
first of all what is sound you know when
we talk about
sound sound is something that we
hear through our ears whether it's
somebody who's
yelling somebody who speaks in a loud
voice loud voice
so they could be yelling
yell to yell he's yelling
or he's shout shout
in right shouting so sometimes we hear
loud sounds when people are
speaking in a loud voice they're
shouting or they're yelling
i'm not shouting or yelling i won't do
that to you but i'm not whispering
either
right pandiro yelling or shouting is
whisper whisper
whisper very small sound whispering
okay now down here this is a problem
with electronic devices your computers
your music players somebody's playing
loud music it's too
loud please
please turn
it down
turn it down means turn down the volume
it's too loud
he will say to his friend hey please
turn it down it's too loud okay let's
talk about some vocabulary
having to do with sound the first
word is to hit hard when something
hits something very hard like lightning
comes from the sky and hits the ground
hard what do we say we say it's strike
and this is a good picture because
usually we call
this type of action lightning strike
if the lightning touches the ground we
say where
did it strike where did it strike ground
but there's other things we can talk
about when we strike something if we're
playing a drum
we strike the drum with a drumstick
and we make a sound so to strike to hit
something
hard strike okay number two
very strange people it's it's kind of
hard to have pictures
when you're describing a sound right so
some of these pictures we have to think
a little bit okay
this is a picture of a sound telling of
a danger
these people are not crazy they're
supposed to be
they're supposed to be very frightened
or scared
why because they heard a sound that
tells them of danger what kind of
sound tells you of a danger if there's a
fire
in your apartment building what can you
hear
some sound will go off telling you be
careful
there's a fire we call that sound
an alarm a fire alarm
if a robber or a bad person breaks a
window
to get into a store at night to steal
something
then a burglar alarm will go off a
burglar
burglar a burglar is the bad
person the criminal who breaks into the
store
a burglar alarm a fire alarm
that's a sound that tells you hey danger
there's something bad happening three
now a message a message telling that
something bad may happen not an alarm
it's before an alarm right you see
a sign that says be careful
joshim hail something bad might happen
the word we want actually is on the sign
itself
it's a warning warning warning
joshua right mori joshua watch for your
head
right watch your head or in this case
don't
go on the land don't go past this sign
it's dangerous warning
warning it's something it's a message
that tells us something bad may happen
we should pay attention to warnings
look at warnings they will help keep you
safe
okay next one number three number four
how high or low a sound is now
when we talk about sound and we'll look
at this more in the reading
you can say a sound is high or low
in terms of what in terms of pitch
now when you say high sound or low sound
think of it this way
an alarm clock you know might sound like
this
that's a high sound alarm sounds don't
sound like this
that's a low sound okay so you have a
high sound
and you have a low sound when we talk
about that
we're talking about the pitch
pitch what is the pitch of the sound
usually we say it's a high pitched
high pitched
high pitched or low
pitched sound
right another couple of examples a small
dog right a small dog goes yep
that's a high pitched sound but a big
dog goes
right that's a low pitched sound so
high-pitched sound
low pitched sound we're talking about
pitch
number five what's wrong she's so
she's so crazy she's really angry right
how loud or soft a sound is maybe she's
crying she's screaming now we're talking
about
loudness or softness remember before
i told you if something's too loud you
say
turn it down you want to turn down
the volume okay so we have
a loud sound the volume is high
a soft sound the volume is low i can't
hear it
right please turn up the volume
so high volume low volume
and as you can see we also use high
pitch
low pitch so we use the words high and
low
to talk about pitch or to talk about
volume
high pitch high volume low pitch
low volume but they're different things
right
pitch and volume are two different
things about
sound okay number six again it's hard to
draw a picture or
to show a picture of a sound in this
case
to make a long deep sound
here you have to imagine you know if you
see a
lightning storm right you see lightning
but after the lightning what do you hear
after the lightning
you hear thunder right and thunder
is a long deep sound it is a
rumble rumble
the rumble right especially if you hear
uh see the lightning it's very close to
you then you hear
and it goes it's not the big thunder
that that happens right away
that's not long that's very short it's
bang whoa
but then you can hear the rumble for a
little bit afterwards it's very
deep and surrounding sound in the sky
that's a rumble also if you're hungry
your stomach will rumble
it's time to eat so your stomach might
rumble
okay okay next one uh
to shake quickly these guys are
street construction crew before they
change the street they have to break the
street up so they use
a jackhammer this is a jack
hammer and the way the jackhammer works
is it moves up and down very quickly to
shake
what is it doing is it like this it's
vibrating to vibrate vibrate okay
to shake quickly back and forth is to
vibrate
okay number eight to pull
and then let go to pull and let go
you can all say what are they doing with
the guitar they are plucking
the guitar not right now right now
they're tuning the guitar
but after they do that then he or she
i'm not sure okay because long hair i
don't know
um he or she is going to uh
touch the strings but pluck the strings
very quickly
gonna pull the string and then let go
and that's how many string
instruments are played you pluck the
strings
right you pull them quickly and then let
go you pluck
you also maybe pluck your hair don't do
that
but some people might do that they pluck
to pull
and then let go pull the hair let go
pluck
now this person is a referee a referee
at a game
maybe you're playing soccer or you're
playing uh baseball or something
and the referee has a whistle a
whistle and when he blows that whistle
right there is a loud high
pitched sound coming from the lips
or whistles what is that it's a whistle
the same one that i just wrote up there
so we call this this um instrument you
can't see it it's made of metal
but what he has in his mouth it's a
whistle
also it's a verb so this whistle that i
put up here
this would be a noun and a high sound
coming from lips or whistles
well of course the sound is a is a noun
but you can also say
to whistle and that is a verb
so whistle can be a noun whistle can
also be a verb
if you use two whistle for example can
you whistle
can you whistle i am whistling
but the sound i'm making that is a
whistle
so whistle can be noun or verb
ten a loud warning
sound we talked about this a little bit
before
a loud warning sound we talked about
alarm but
alarm can also be siren especially
on a fire truck or a police car
we say the siren can you hear the sirens
the police are coming or the fire truck
is coming that's a siren we can also
call those alarm
when a fire truck goes to a fire if
there are two
fire trucks we say it's a two
alarm fire
that means two fire trucks came
two alarm fire two fire trucks came
to put out the fire if it's a five alarm
fire
what's a big fire five fire trucks
came okay so alarm and siren very
similar
but usually we say siren is on a vehicle
it's the noise or the the
the object that makes the noise number
eleven
something that is asked right he has
a question this boy has a question raise
your arm
if you have a question question is
something
that is asked okay next one
opposite of forward so this girl
she's kind of looking this way but she
could be looking behind her
forward pandero is very simple back
or you could also put backward
right forward back or backward
sometimes people don't say ward they
just say back
of course you can also say front front
back
frontward or forward backward don't say
frontward
forward or backwards usually forward
though is used for motion
he is walking forward look forward
backward walk backward look
backward but if you're talking about for
example
somebody's where somebody thing is this
is my front
this is my back so you could say both
things right
look forward look to the front or this
is your front
look back look backward or this is my
back
okay so forward and back
thirteen huh very interesting picture
they're very dressed up
softly softly means what it means
gently he is gently uh he's a gentleman
so he's acting very gently right gently
is
softly not hard for example if you're
playing an instrument like the
drum before i said to strike you hit
something hard
you can play a drum gently or
softly making a little bit of noise
you're playing it gently okay
okay oh here we have a dinosaur right
the part of the body between the head
and the shoulders here's the head here's
the shoulder
so what is this part of the body between
the head
and the shoulders and of course on the
dinosaur it's very long
also on a giraffe it's very long
we say it's the neck right the neck is
the part of the body between the head
and the shoulders on me on people the
neck is very short
on dinosaurs some dinosaurs and giraffes
the neck is very long
okay a long thin rope what is this rope
that this person is tying around their
finger
we call that a string a string
you prob you might have strings in your
shoes
to close your shoes up you probably have
strings in your backpack right maybe you
have
strings in your backpack to close
pockets
strings are very useful okay our last
word
forward forward means
fourth okay now we use fourth by the way
that might be hard to pronounce
fourth and then r right and th
fourth fourth okay
so what he's doing is his voice is
coming forth
right uh his air is coming forth his
sound is coming forth from his
mouth so it's coming forward right it's
going forward from his
mouth but when you speak the sound is
coming
forth from your mouth okay
so that's interesting that's a where you
would
probably use that word okay let's take a
look at the exercises the first exercise
here
complete each sentence with a word from
the box
we have many different sentences we have
blanks in those sentences
we have to fill those blanks with words
from the box
what are the words the words are
strike strike
alarm alarm
warning warning then we have
rumble rumble
vibrate vibrate
pluck pluck
pitch pitch remember with this
p sound you've got a p pa
right so pluck pitch
okay next one volume
v sound volume
volume okay those are our words let's
see how they fit
into the sentences number one people ran
to the underground passage when they
heard the fire
what now remember in times of danger
there's a sound that comes out and it
warns
people of danger right you hear it you
hear the fire
what what is that sound it's the alarm
the fire alarm the burglar alarm okay
it's an alarm
it's a sound that says something bad is
happening
be careful okay number two
i was so hungry that so
adjective that good construction i was
so hungry that
i could hear my stomach what remember
when i talked about this word
i gave two examples one was the thunder
you know the thunder in the sky after a
lightning strike
but you can also hear very more commonly
when you get hungry your stomach will
make a gold gold sound
it will do what it will rumble
i was so hungry that i could hear my
stomach
rumble okay number three
birds sing at a really high
what when you hear birds they're like
they're not like right so what is that
remember we talked about that a high
sound it's like a little dog barking
that's also a high what it's a high
pitch birds sing at a high pitch
i've never heard a bird sing in a
low pitch right that would be very
strange i'd be scared what kind of bird
is that
okay usually birds will sing in a very
high pitch
a very high pitched noise let's move on
to number four
the police gave me a beep not to go
near the building so the police are
telling me
don't go not to go don't go
near the building why because it's
dangerous
and it's a message that the police
giving me
the police are giving me a message
telling me not to go somewhere they are
doing what
they are giving me a warning they're
giving me a warning
not to go somewhere five
i can't hear the radio turn the
beep up this is an example i gave you
remember at the very beginning
we saw the boy right he was is too loud
so he says turn it down please turn it
down
but sometimes if the what is very
low you can't hear it you want it to
turn up you're turning
up what what are you turning up so that
you can hear something
you're turning up the volume turn the
volume
up or pandito turn the volume down
but if you can't hear if you can't hear
it's too low the volume is too low turn
the volume
up six watch the violinist
somebody who plays the violin beep the
string
gently remember i said many people who
play an
instrument that is a string instrument
like a guitar
a violin a harp right what are they
doing
they're grabbing the strings and they're
letting go they pull
and let go they are plucking
watch the violinist pluck the string
gently usually violinists don't pluck
the string right they have a bow
and they they rub the strings but
sometimes they might pluck the
strings to make a sound also some
violinists
do that okay seven and eight
lightning may beep the tree during a
thunderstorm
so this is like lightning might come
down and hit the tree hard
of course lightning hits hard with a lot
of energy right
so it might come down and remember this
is a very
common word used with lightning what
word was it
we said strike lightning may strike
the tree during a thunderstorm
number eight i felt my cell phone beep
in my pocket so if you have a cell phone
right
and like me right now i don't want my
cell phone going off because i'm talking
to you if my friend calls me
interrupts us so i turned my cell phone
on
a different mode so it will shake you
don't know
i know because it's in my pocket i can
feel it but there's no sound
i've left i felt my cell phone
what vibrate in my pocket
right you can feel your cell phone
vibrate
so turn off your phone obviously in
class or if you're doing something
important
but you can keep it on vibration mode
you can feel it vibrate okay well that
wraps up the vocabulary section of the
lesson let's take a short break here

hey everybody
00:09
welcome back to reading for vocabulary
00:12
i'm brian stewart
00:13
we're on lesson seven right now do you
00:16
hear that
00:17
what do you hear what oh i'm just
00:19
kidding that's the name of the lesson
00:21
right
00:21
do you hear that do you hear that we're
00:24
going to focus on
00:26
let's learn what sound is
00:30
so we're going to study about sound what
00:32
exactly
00:33
is sound when we talk about things like
00:36
sound or sight or
00:38
smells that's an area of science
00:41
so we're talking about science in this
00:43
lesson
00:45
first of all what is sound you know when
00:47
we talk about
00:48
sound sound is something that we
00:52
hear through our ears whether it's
00:54
somebody who's
00:56
yelling somebody who speaks in a loud
00:59
voice loud voice
01:02
so they could be yelling
01:05
yell to yell he's yelling
01:09
or he's shout shout
01:13
in right shouting so sometimes we hear
01:16
loud sounds when people are
01:18
speaking in a loud voice they're
01:19
shouting or they're yelling
01:22
i'm not shouting or yelling i won't do
01:24
that to you but i'm not whispering
01:27
either
01:27
right pandiro yelling or shouting is
01:31
whisper whisper
01:34
whisper very small sound whispering
01:38
okay now down here this is a problem
01:42
with electronic devices your computers
01:46
your music players somebody's playing
01:50
loud music it's too
01:53
loud please
01:57
please turn
02:00
it down
02:03
turn it down means turn down the volume
02:07
it's too loud
02:08
he will say to his friend hey please
02:11
turn it down it's too loud okay let's
02:14
talk about some vocabulary
02:17
having to do with sound the first
02:20
word is to hit hard when something
02:23
hits something very hard like lightning
02:26
comes from the sky and hits the ground
02:30
hard what do we say we say it's strike
02:33
and this is a good picture because
02:35
usually we call
02:37
this type of action lightning strike
02:41
if the lightning touches the ground we
02:43
say where
02:44
did it strike where did it strike ground
02:48
but there's other things we can talk
02:49
about when we strike something if we're
02:51
playing a drum
02:52
we strike the drum with a drumstick
02:56
and we make a sound so to strike to hit
03:00
something
03:00
hard strike okay number two
03:06
very strange people it's it's kind of
03:09
hard to have pictures
03:11
when you're describing a sound right so
03:12
some of these pictures we have to think
03:14
a little bit okay
03:16
this is a picture of a sound telling of
03:19
a danger
03:20
these people are not crazy they're
03:22
supposed to be
03:24
they're supposed to be very frightened
03:26
or scared
03:27
why because they heard a sound that
03:30
tells them of danger what kind of
03:34
sound tells you of a danger if there's a
03:37
fire
03:38
in your apartment building what can you
03:41
hear
03:41
some sound will go off telling you be
03:44
careful
03:45
there's a fire we call that sound
03:48
an alarm a fire alarm
03:52
if a robber or a bad person breaks a
03:55
window
03:56
to get into a store at night to steal
03:59
something
04:00
then a burglar alarm will go off a
04:03
burglar
04:04
burglar a burglar is the bad
04:08
person the criminal who breaks into the
04:10
store
04:11
a burglar alarm a fire alarm
04:14
that's a sound that tells you hey danger
04:18
there's something bad happening three
04:22
now a message a message telling that
04:25
something bad may happen not an alarm
04:29
it's before an alarm right you see
04:33
a sign that says be careful
04:37
joshim hail something bad might happen
04:41
the word we want actually is on the sign
04:44
itself
04:44
it's a warning warning warning
04:48
joshua right mori joshua watch for your
04:51
head
04:51
right watch your head or in this case
04:54
don't
04:54
go on the land don't go past this sign
04:58
it's dangerous warning
05:02
warning it's something it's a message
05:04
that tells us something bad may happen
05:07
we should pay attention to warnings
05:10
look at warnings they will help keep you
05:13
safe
05:14
okay next one number three number four
05:17
how high or low a sound is now
05:20
when we talk about sound and we'll look
05:22
at this more in the reading
05:24
you can say a sound is high or low
05:28
in terms of what in terms of pitch
05:32
now when you say high sound or low sound
05:35
think of it this way
05:36
an alarm clock you know might sound like
05:38
this
05:40
that's a high sound alarm sounds don't
05:43
sound like this
05:45
that's a low sound okay so you have a
05:47
high sound
05:48
and you have a low sound when we talk
05:51
about that
05:52
we're talking about the pitch
05:55
pitch what is the pitch of the sound
05:59
usually we say it's a high pitched
06:03
high pitched
06:07
high pitched or low
06:10
pitched sound
06:13
right another couple of examples a small
06:16
dog right a small dog goes yep
06:20
that's a high pitched sound but a big
06:22
dog goes
06:24
right that's a low pitched sound so
06:27
high-pitched sound
06:28
low pitched sound we're talking about
06:31
pitch
06:32
number five what's wrong she's so
06:35
she's so crazy she's really angry right
06:38
how loud or soft a sound is maybe she's
06:43
crying she's screaming now we're talking
06:46
about
06:47
loudness or softness remember before
06:50
i told you if something's too loud you
06:53
say
06:53
turn it down you want to turn down
06:56
the volume okay so we have
07:00
a loud sound the volume is high
07:04
a soft sound the volume is low i can't
07:08
hear it
07:09
right please turn up the volume
07:12
so high volume low volume
07:15
and as you can see we also use high
07:17
pitch
07:18
low pitch so we use the words high and
07:21
low
07:21
to talk about pitch or to talk about
07:24
volume
07:25
high pitch high volume low pitch
07:28
low volume but they're different things
07:31
right
07:31
pitch and volume are two different
07:33
things about
07:34
sound okay number six again it's hard to
07:38
draw a picture or
07:40
to show a picture of a sound in this
07:43
case
07:43
to make a long deep sound
07:48
here you have to imagine you know if you
07:50
see a
07:51
lightning storm right you see lightning
07:54
but after the lightning what do you hear
07:57
after the lightning
07:58
you hear thunder right and thunder
08:02
is a long deep sound it is a
08:06
rumble rumble
08:09
the rumble right especially if you hear
08:13
uh see the lightning it's very close to
08:16
you then you hear
08:17
and it goes it's not the big thunder
08:20
that that happens right away
08:21
that's not long that's very short it's
08:23
bang whoa
08:24
but then you can hear the rumble for a
08:27
little bit afterwards it's very
08:28
deep and surrounding sound in the sky
08:32
that's a rumble also if you're hungry
08:36
your stomach will rumble
08:42
it's time to eat so your stomach might
08:44
rumble
08:45
okay okay next one uh
08:48
to shake quickly these guys are
08:52
street construction crew before they
08:56
change the street they have to break the
08:58
street up so they use
09:00
a jackhammer this is a jack
09:03
hammer and the way the jackhammer works
09:06
is it moves up and down very quickly to
09:09
shake
09:10
what is it doing is it like this it's
09:13
vibrating to vibrate vibrate okay
09:17
to shake quickly back and forth is to
09:20
vibrate
09:22
okay number eight to pull
09:25
and then let go to pull and let go
09:29
you can all say what are they doing with
09:30
the guitar they are plucking
09:33
the guitar not right now right now
09:35
they're tuning the guitar
09:37
but after they do that then he or she
09:40
i'm not sure okay because long hair i
09:43
don't know
09:44
um he or she is going to uh
09:48
touch the strings but pluck the strings
09:51
very quickly
09:51
gonna pull the string and then let go
09:54
and that's how many string
09:56
instruments are played you pluck the
09:58
strings
10:00
right you pull them quickly and then let
10:02
go you pluck
10:04
you also maybe pluck your hair don't do
10:07
that
10:07
but some people might do that they pluck
10:10
to pull
10:10
and then let go pull the hair let go
10:13
pluck
10:15
now this person is a referee a referee
10:19
at a game
10:20
maybe you're playing soccer or you're
10:22
playing uh baseball or something
10:24
and the referee has a whistle a
10:27
whistle and when he blows that whistle
10:32
right there is a loud high
10:35
pitched sound coming from the lips
10:39
or whistles what is that it's a whistle
10:41
the same one that i just wrote up there
10:43
so we call this this um instrument you
10:47
can't see it it's made of metal
10:49
but what he has in his mouth it's a
10:51
whistle
10:52
also it's a verb so this whistle that i
10:55
put up here
10:56
this would be a noun and a high sound
10:59
coming from lips or whistles
11:01
well of course the sound is a is a noun
11:04
but you can also say
11:06
to whistle and that is a verb
11:10
so whistle can be a noun whistle can
11:12
also be a verb
11:13
if you use two whistle for example can
11:16
you whistle
11:20
can you whistle i am whistling
11:23
but the sound i'm making that is a
11:26
whistle
11:26
so whistle can be noun or verb
11:29
ten a loud warning
11:33
sound we talked about this a little bit
11:36
before
11:36
a loud warning sound we talked about
11:38
alarm but
11:40
alarm can also be siren especially
11:43
on a fire truck or a police car
11:47
we say the siren can you hear the sirens
11:50
the police are coming or the fire truck
11:53
is coming that's a siren we can also
11:56
call those alarm
11:58
when a fire truck goes to a fire if
12:01
there are two
12:01
fire trucks we say it's a two
12:06
alarm fire
12:10
that means two fire trucks came
12:13
two alarm fire two fire trucks came
12:16
to put out the fire if it's a five alarm
12:19
fire
12:20
what's a big fire five fire trucks
12:24
came okay so alarm and siren very
12:26
similar
12:27
but usually we say siren is on a vehicle
12:30
it's the noise or the the
12:32
the object that makes the noise number
12:34
eleven
12:36
something that is asked right he has
12:39

12:46
something
12:47
that is asked okay next one
12:51
opposite of forward so this girl
12:55
she's kind of looking this way but she
12:57
could be looking behind her
12:59
forward pandero is very simple back
13:03
or you could also put backward
13:06
right forward back or backward
13:10
sometimes people don't say ward they
13:12
just say back
13:13
of course you can also say front front
13:16
back
13:17
frontward or forward backward don't say
13:20

13:21
forward or backwards usually forward
13:24
though is used for motion
13:26
he is walking forward look forward
13:30
backward walk backward look
13:34

13:37
example
13:38

13:49
look back look backward or this is my

14:00
softly softly means what it means
14:03
gently he is gently uh he's a gentleman
14:07
so he's acting very gently right gently
14:10
is
14:11
softly not hard for example if you're
14:14
playing an instrument like the
14:16
drum before i said to strike you hit
14:18
something hard
14:19
you can play a drum gently or
14:23
softly making a little bit of noise
14:26
you're playing it gently okay
14:30

14:33
the part of the body between the head
14:35
and the shoulders here's the head here's
14:38
the shoulder
14:39
so what is this part of the body between
14:42
the head
14:43
and the shoulders and of course on the
14:45
dinosaur it's very long
14:47
also on a giraffe it's very long
14:50
we say it's the neck right the neck is
14:53
the part of the body between the head
14:55
and the shoulders on me on people the
14:58
neck is very short
15:00
on dinosaurs some dinosaurs and giraffes
15:03
the neck is very long
15:06
okay a long thin rope what is this rope
15:10
that this person is tying around their
15:12
finger
15:13
we call that a string a string
15:16
you prob you might have strings in your
15:19
shoes
15:20
to close your shoes up you probably have
15:23
strings in your backpack right maybe you
15:25

strings are very useful okay our last
15:32
word
15:33
forward forward means
15:36
fourth okay now we use fourth by the way
15:39
that might be hard to pronounce
15:43
fourth and then r right and th
15:48
fourth fourth okay
15:51
so what he's doing is his voice is
15:54
coming forth
15:55
right uh his air is coming forth his
15:58
sound is coming forth from his
16:01
mouth so it's coming forward right it's
16:04
going forward from his
16:05
mouth but when you speak the sound is
16:08
