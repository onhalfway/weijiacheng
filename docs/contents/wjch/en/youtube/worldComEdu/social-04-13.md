hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading my name is brian stewart
and in this lesson we're looking at
social studies book 4
lesson 13 maps and
locations so where do you live
don't be worried i'm not i'm not going
to drop by i'm that's the subject
of today's lesson in this lesson you
will discover
how to use a map and how
addresses work so you can think about
where do you live
and can you find your house on a map
well let's take a look at the lesson
as usual we start with the vocabulary
and the first
word in our vocabulary list are actually
two words is
absolute location what does that mean
absolute location well you may know what
location means
location is you know where
something is when we talk about location
we're talking about
you know is is it uh in this state
is it in this country uh is it on this
street
where something is absolute
means very precise
very very detailed so absolute location
means the exact exact as this it means
very precise or very uh accurate
exact location of a place so some people
might talk about absolute location
however most people just say
location absolute location is more of a
technical term used for very precise
language okay most people just say
location
what is the location of your school or
where is your school
located you could also use it that way
okay
let's move on relative location see now
we saw
absolute location now we have relative
location
and we can tell from the different words
that these two ideas are different
absolute location is the exact location
of an object or something relative
location is a way of describing where
something is
by comparing it to other things
for example you can see in this map here
right you have
my location looks like an apartment
building maybe you
are in an office building this could be
an office building too
let's say it's an office building and
where is your office building
well it's close to your home it's about
a block
away from your home so that's a relative
location
when you compare where something is
compared to something else
absolute location is just giving the
information to say
exactly where it is located and we'll
talk about that of course in this lesson
okay so that's the difference between
absolute location
the exact location and relative location
just where is it compared to other
things
okay next we have
column column now sometimes you look at
a table
or maybe a map and you'll see that there
are
a rows going across right there are
numbers that that might go across
we call those rows there might be
numbers going down
those are called columns so in a table
there are rows
and columns so a column is a line of
words or numbers
written under each other that goes down
a page you read the column down from the
top
to the next on underneath underneath
underneath you don't go like this right
you read straight down
and on a row of course you read straight
across just like as if you're reading
text or reading some english english
reads from left to right not all
languages do of course
okay that's a column or row
we just talked about row row of course
are the numbers of the words that are
going across
in a table or in some kind of grid a
grid is a system of lines going
down up and down and across that's a
grid and if you read
the numbers or words on a grid that are
going across
that is a row so you might have several
rows in your table
a row is a set of straight lines on a
map
that makes squares you could also say
that on a map you can divide your map
with lines that are going up and down
and also across
so you can see in the column on that map
grid
you can go down the column or you can go
across and this is a good way to find
something in a map an absolute location
for example
because if you number the rows or the
columns across the top a b
c d e and you number the rows going down
one two three four
you can say h four and you go across
h that's your that's your column go down
the column until you see the row four
and boom it's in that square if you ever
play the game
battleship that's exactly what's going
on right
you call out a number a5 miss or hit
right and then you hit the battleship or
not so that's a fun game to play
but that's exactly what we're talking
about here with
columns and rows okay
map grid map grid i just explained that
right you
take a map and you make a set of
straight lines on
a map that makes squares so you have
lines that go up and down
usually north to south because it's a
map and then you have
lines that go from east west to east or
east to west it doesn't matter
south to north but anyway you have lines
that are
perpendicular to each other that means a
90 degree angle and they make
squares on your map so you have a map
and you make these small squares on your
map
so that you can easily find out where
something is like i said you say oh my
house is located in
h4 now my house is in that square
okay great now you can make the square
small or you can make the squares big
right so depending on how exact or
detailed
you want the map coordinates
to be coordinates are a set of numbers
that tell you where something is on a
map
okay and the gps system that you might
use in your phone
uses the same system okay
next we have separate separate means
apart from each other they're not
together
they are separate okay so it just means
apart from each other we have a
this is a very interesting picture isn't
it those are weird looking up office
buildings
it looks like they're going to fall oh
no no of course i'm sure they're
engineered
so that they do not fall but they're
pretty cool looking right this is kind
of
cool architecture right okay so of
course
the the office buildings were probably
built by the same
builder maybe the same architect made
them of course because it would look
silly if there was just one of them
what's going on so you have two of them
but they're not
together physically they are separate of
course they are together
aesthetically in in terms of their
design
they're together but they are they're
not touching each other they are
separate
envelope some people say envelope
envelope
doesn't matter it does you know nobody's
going to care which way you say it
envelope or envelope most people i think
say envelope
envelope of course is a paper container
in which people put a letter or a card
of course if somebody has a birthday you
get them a birthday card right you sign
the inside of the birthday card
then you close the card and you put it
inside an
envelope and then you give it to the
person you put the person's name
on it right well a long time ago
before you were born people used to send
paper to each other
and they called these things letters
okay they would write on a piece of
paper their message they would
fold it up put it in an envelope and
they would go to the post office
and mail it it takes maybe a day
sometimes several days depending on how
far away you're sending your letter the
other person would receive it and read
your letter
yeah that was before email of course you
have probably have no idea
so anyway an envelope when you did that
you had to put the address right
on the envelope of course nowadays we
still use that but most
most of the time it's just boxes and
company like you order something on the
internet
and the company will send it to you but
they put their address not on an
envelope it's in a box because you
ordered some goods
but they still put your address on it so
just
basically an envelope is a paper
container in which people put
a letter or card the idea of course is
that we're writing the address
here of course nowadays you're more
familiar with boxes
same idea you still have to write
somebody's address
on this uh in this space so that the
letter or the box
gets to your house okay those
are our words for today okay let's talk
about the first main idea in this lesson
and by the way i should point something
out right away so you don't get confused
in your book you might see that at the
top in the book it says
rose and over here it says columns
in your book sorry about that that may
have been a misprint
but it should be columns these a
b c and d are columns
one two three four are rows so
you can just make that change in your
book okay
and you know sometimes mistakes are made
printing mistakes are kind of common
unfortunately
okay so anyway this is using
a map grid okay and we talked about this
already in the vocabulary right i said
you know you have their
your columns across the top a b c d
usually they use numbers at the top
and they use letters are sorry let me
switch that around
they use letters across the top a b
c d and they use numbers for the rows
going down
that's very typical for example you're
maybe too young to use microsoft excel
but that's what they do for that program
that's very common uh technique or a
very common method
so as we can see using a
map grid is really convenient because we
can find these places
that are over here on the map key now
what by the way we have a key
key what do you mean key is it a key
like you open a door
no on a key on a map just
explains what symbols mean so if you
have a symbol
you see this little picture this is a
symbol you say what is that symbol
well in the key it explains that this
symbol what does it mean it means nick's
home
and over here you see an envelope right
and you say
what is that symbol what is that symbol
for and it says post office
that is what the key does it shows you
the symbol that appears on the map
and then explains what that symbol is
and that is a map key
sometimes people call it a legend
legend but most of the time people call
it a key
a map key so we have school we have
hospital we have a library and all
that's what these symbols mean
now if you want to know like in your
town where
are these places well for example where
is nick's home
right he invited you over for his
birthday party you prepared a card in an
envelope right
so don't go to the envelope simple go to
nick's home
where is nick's home on the map grid we
can find it very easily right
where is it it's in b
one right because the intersection of
one and b
ta-dah there's nick's house so you can
see
a map grid is really convenient it's
very easy
to find things using a map grid let's do
one more
where is the hospital well
we need to find this symbol right here
because in the key
it tells us this symbol is the hospital
so here's the hospital here but on the
map grid where is it
well we can see it's in column c and
it's in
row four so the hospital is in
c c4 that's where the hospital is
so using a grid is very easy when you're
finding things
on a map great okay so and
by the way we talked about absolute
location and relative location
so if we say absolute location if we use
the map grid
that tells us exactly precisely
where nick's house is so that is
absolute location when we say
nick's house is in b1
right so that's absolute location same
thing for the hospital
absolute the absolute location of the
hospital
is c4 that is the absolute location
but what about relative location
remember relative location
you're comparing the location of one
thing to the location
of something else so if again if we look
at nick's house as an example
and we want to compare it with something
else well we see the
post office right the post office is
next to nick's house so we can use that
as the
relative location we can say nick's
house is
near the post office or you can also say
next to because it's
it's uh it's in the next block over it's
in the next
building over it's next to it's next to
the post office
or it's near if it's near it doesn't
have to be
right next to it it could be a couple
buildings away but it's
close right so next two means the two
buildings are right next to each other
but near it could be next to or it could
be one or two buildings
away from it okay but it's just near so
nick's house is near the post office
that is relative
location okay so we can use maps
to find both the absolute and relative
locations
of places and of course this is very
helpful when you're
out in the city and you're going to
someplace new you've never been there
before
so you need to know either the relative
location or the
absolute location of something now of
course absolute location this is one way
to find absolute location
but another way to find absolute
location is not using a map grid it's
using something else
and that's something else is the address
right now the address also tells you the
absolute location it doesn't use a map
grid
it uses a system of numbers and street
names
and city or village name city a village
town or city names
sometimes you can also use the country
name if you're sending something to
another country you have to put the
country on it as well
so address your address is an absolute
location
because it tells everybody exactly
precisely where something is located
now we talked about this before when we
talked about the letter and i
i told you you guys don't use letters
anymore but you can still see it of
course on packages that are sent to your
home
you have to write the address on an
envelope when you send a letter now
different countries have
different postal systems so
the way that you write your address
might be different
from some the way somebody else uses an
address
in america when you send something to
somebody
you write their address usually of
course you put their name so let's use
my name for example
you would write you're sending something
to me you would write brian
stewart at the top at the top
for example here and you can see the
name right here i'm rewriting it because
it's a little difficult to see it
you shouldn't write an address like this
it's a little difficult to see
but you see what is his address is that
then there's a number
200 i have no idea
okay let's just say let's just say it's
200
and i'm i'm gonna guess i think it's
schwab
uh s let's i'll just write it it doesn't
matter
schwab and then i don't know what that
is let's just say it's avenue
now in america there's many names for
streets sometimes people will put
s t that means street or they'll put a v
e i think that's what this is
and ave stands for avenue
so there's many words for streets i
think we covered this in a previous
lesson so the street
avenue boulevard there's a lot of
different names for streets
but anyway that's the name of the street
and this is the number so the post
office person when they're going down
the street there's numbers on
each building and they say you know if
they're going down schwab avenue
they start you know maybe with uh 100
and they kind of keep going until they
hit
200 and then they find your house of
course where is it
now what is this here uh this is a
the name of a
ah i think it's k oh it's cambridge okay
uh
but again don't write like that because
that's horrible
the post the postal the postal post
service worker
will have a very difficult time reading
your address so be
very clear and write carefully
cambridge how they spell that cambridge
cambridge what is that massachusetts
maybe
yeah okay massachusetts there is a
cambridge in massachusetts
and m-a-s-s is the abbreviation for the
state
again in america you don't have to write
the whole name massachusetts
that's a really long difficult name
mississippi oh my gosh
so you don't have to write the whole
name of the state people abbreviate them
right sometimes it's just two letters
like nevada is
nv right california c a period
right in this case massachusetts m-a-s-s
period
you don't have to write out the whole
name of the state and then what are the
what's this over here this is what we
call the zip code
and again the handwriting is horrible
that looks like a b
but b doesn't exist in a zip code it
should be
all letters so i think it's 1 3
2 4 9. looks like maybe 2 4 9. again
it's hard if if i was a postal service
worker
and i saw this i would send it back to
the person who was trying to deliver it
because this is horrible that's
the handwriting is terrible again if
you're going to write an address on
something
make sure you write clearly
okay make sure that the person uh the
post office
people the people who work in the post
office can read the address
on the box that you're sending or the
package that you're sending
okay this is this is terrible okay so
anyway you write it out so you have your
name
you have the street address and then you
have the name of the city
the state and then the zip code the zip
code is very important because the post
office system
in america has a zip code that number
tells them the location so
even if they can't read you know your
writing in some parts
they can they can figure out the town
and the state by the zip code easily now
it might be a little bit more difficult
the street address
that's a little bit more difficult
because the zip code is for a large
area but anyway zip code is very
important and you should include that if
you're sending something
to an address in america and of course
like i said before many different
countries have different systems
so make sure you know the system and it
could be different for a different
country you know maybe they put
the the sometimes i see sometimes they
put the city first right
and then they put the street address or
they don't have street names
okay i've seen that also it's just
numbers and maybe a location
so it depends okay but that ad
that's an address and that address tells
the absolute the precise exact
location of the the house the apartment
the office building
whatever the place is that you're
sending the package to
okay let's move on
now it's time to do the reading and as
usual i will read out loud you guys can
repeat after me out loud or
in your head let's focus on the
vocabulary that we learned
and also pick up some new words maybe
along the way
you guys ready let's begin
everything has a location
we can use maps to find the location
of something there are two kinds
of location absolute location
and relative location
to take an example nick
lives in west lake
the absolute location of nick's house
is 17 crumble
street westlake
it is the address of nick's
house the relative location
of nick's house is near the post office
it's easy to find nick's house
on a map
using the columns and rows
of a map grid his house
can be found on the map
both of them show the location of nick's
house the map shows both
the absolute and relative
locations
sometimes nick writes letters
to his uncle his uncle lives
in a separate town from nick's family
nick has to write his absolute location
on the envelope before he posts
the letter just want to point out
something
post the letter you can also say mail
the letter
i think post is more common
in british english most americans will
just say
mail so post and post isn't just for
the verb it's also the noun a lot of br
you know if you're
if you're in england or britain people
might say did you receive anything
in the post that means did you receive
any letters or packages
in the mail an american would say did
you receive anything
in the mail or what's in the mail today
a british person would say what's in the
post today so a little bit difference
between
the two words between british english
and american english interesting
anyway so we can see that you know nick
writes letters wow
he's using old technology maybe but you
know sometimes people like to write
letters because
it's more personal right it's it's a
little bit
it shows more effort if you write a
letter than just writing an email
of course you know 99.9 of people
just write emails these days but you
know sometimes you can send a letter
it's
it's nicer right it's more personal
shows that you're making more effort
it's up to you okay
let's see how this reading passage was
organized in this case we have
compare and contrast and of course we're
talking about two different things
in this unit right absolute location and
relative location so let's compare the
two here we have
absolute location on the left
and we have relative location on the
right by the way on the left on the
right
relative location because we're
comparing okay
okay so absolute location here we have
nick's house is 17
crumble street what was the town in
which
he lived according to the reading did
you catch it it was
west lake west lake
and now if you want to be very specific
right you could also put the state
and then of course you'd put the zip
code after that so you'd put the state
and the zip code and that is the
complete address
and if you're mailing to another country
you'd put the country name underneath as
well
but anyway 17 crumble street westlake
now a relative location what is nick's
house near
and don't say near two there's no reason
to say near two just say near
uh don't say it's near to blah blah blah
no it's just near
okay that's that's enough okay so nick's
house is
near the what do you remember from the
reading it's near the post office right
they said
it is near the post office
two words post office
so nick's house can be found on the map
using columns and rows
of a what remember we talked about this
quite a bit actually
you know you have your columns you know
going up and down you have your rows
going across
and we call that a grid what kind of
grid it's a map grid so
here we have two words also map
grid oh yeah i spelled it right okay
good
nick's house can be found on the map
using columns and rows
of a map grid and of course when you
make squares
on a map that's called a grid now
both of them both the absolute location
and the relative location show the what
of nick's house of course that's what
we're talking about in this unit
we're talking about the location of
things so
show the location location
location of nick's house okay
and that's how we know where things are
and of course it's especially important
when you want to send
a letter or most often nowadays packages
to a certain a home an apartment an
office whatever
a company you want to send a package to
them
you need to know the absolute location
and you write the absolute location
of course we don't use map grids don't
send a box to
h6 that's the map grid right because
you know different people will have
different maps you know the
the grids will be different right but
the addresses
are always the same the address is the
best way to send a package
don't send the package saying h6 because
the post i was gonna go
h6 on what map right so use the
address okay but you know if you
and your friend or somebody else has the
same map with the same map grid
then you can use the map grid but
usually we don't do that
but like i said before gps does use a
map grid that's used by everybody in the
world
and that's how gps works global
positioning
satellites that system works our global
positioning system
but that's very precise the military
uses that and other people
as well who want to be very precise in
their location
that's using a grid system but of course
most people will just use addresses
to either send a package or if you're
going to a new place
and you want to visit a museum
you want to find a movie theater you
want to find somebody's house or
somebody's office building
you use an address okay well that's it
for this lesson
now we know how to get around
in the world using maps grids and
especially
addresses thanks for standing with me
hope you enjoyed this lesson and learned
a lot
we'll see you in the next one take care
everybody bye bye
you

hello everybody
00:09
welcome back to american textbook
00:11
reading my name is brian stewart
00:13
and in this lesson we're looking at
00:15
social studies book 4
00:17
lesson 13 maps and
00:21
locations so where do you live
00:24
don't be worried i'm not i'm not going
00:25
to drop by i'm that's the subject
00:28
of today's lesson in this lesson you
00:31
will discover
00:32
how to use a map and how
00:35
addresses work so you can think about
00:38
where do you live
00:39
and can you find your house on a map
00:42
well let's take a look at the lesson
00:47
as usual we start with the vocabulary
00:50
and the first
00:51
word in our vocabulary list are actually
00:54
two words is
00:55
absolute location what does that mean
00:59
absolute location well you may know what
01:02
location means
01:04
location is you know where
01:07
something is when we talk about location
01:10
we're talking about
01:11
you know is is it uh in this state
01:15
is it in this country uh is it on this
01:17
street
01:18
where something is absolute
01:21
means very precise
01:24
very very detailed so absolute location
01:29
means the exact exact as this it means
01:33
very precise or very uh accurate
01:36
exact location of a place so some people
01:40
might talk about absolute location
01:42
however most people just say
01:44
location absolute location is more of a
01:47
technical term used for very precise
01:51
language okay most people just say
01:54
location
01:55
what is the location of your school or
01:57
where is your school
01:59
located you could also use it that way
02:02
okay
02:02
let's move on relative location see now
02:06
we saw
02:07
absolute location now we have relative
02:10
location
02:11
and we can tell from the different words
02:13
that these two ideas are different
02:15
absolute location is the exact location
02:19
of an object or something relative
02:23
location is a way of describing where
02:27
something is
02:28
by comparing it to other things
02:32
for example you can see in this map here
02:34
right you have
02:35
my location looks like an apartment
02:37
building maybe you
02:40
are in an office building this could be
02:42
an office building too
02:43
let's say it's an office building and
02:45
where is your office building
02:47
well it's close to your home it's about
02:51
a block
02:52
away from your home so that's a relative
02:54
location
02:55
when you compare where something is
02:57
compared to something else
02:59
absolute location is just giving the
03:01
information to say
03:03
exactly where it is located and we'll
03:05
talk about that of course in this lesson
03:07
okay so that's the difference between
03:09
absolute location
03:10
the exact location and relative location
03:13
just where is it compared to other
03:16
things
03:17
okay next we have
03:20
column column now sometimes you look at
03:23
a table
03:24
or maybe a map and you'll see that there
03:27
are
03:27
a rows going across right there are
03:30
numbers that that might go across
03:32
we call those rows there might be
03:34
numbers going down
03:35
those are called columns so in a table
03:38
there are rows
03:39
and columns so a column is a line of
03:41
words or numbers
03:43
written under each other that goes down
03:46
a page you read the column down from the
03:48
top
03:49
to the next on underneath underneath
03:51
underneath you don't go like this right
03:52
you read straight down
03:54
and on a row of course you read straight
03:56
across just like as if you're reading
03:58
text or reading some english english
04:01
reads from left to right not all
04:03
languages do of course
04:04
okay that's a column or row
04:08
we just talked about row row of course
04:10
are the numbers of the words that are
04:11
going across
04:12
in a table or in some kind of grid a
04:15
grid is a system of lines going
04:17
down up and down and across that's a
04:20
grid and if you read
04:22
the numbers or words on a grid that are
04:25
going across
04:26
that is a row so you might have several
04:28
rows in your table
04:30
a row is a set of straight lines on a
04:32
map
04:33
that makes squares you could also say
04:35
that on a map you can divide your map
04:37
with lines that are going up and down
04:39
and also across
04:41
so you can see in the column on that map
04:43
grid
04:44
you can go down the column or you can go
04:46
across and this is a good way to find
04:48
something in a map an absolute location
04:50
for example
04:51
because if you number the rows or the
04:54
columns across the top a b
04:56
c d e and you number the rows going down
04:58
one two three four
04:59
you can say h four and you go across
05:02
h that's your that's your column go down
05:05
the column until you see the row four
05:07
and boom it's in that square if you ever
05:10
play the game
05:10
battleship that's exactly what's going
05:13
on right
05:14
you call out a number a5 miss or hit
05:17
right and then you hit the battleship or
05:20
not so that's a fun game to play
05:22
but that's exactly what we're talking
05:23
about here with
05:25
columns and rows okay
05:29
map grid map grid i just explained that
05:33
right you
05:34
take a map and you make a set of
05:36
straight lines on
05:38
a map that makes squares so you have
05:40
lines that go up and down
05:41
usually north to south because it's a
05:43
map and then you have
05:45
lines that go from east west to east or
05:48
east to west it doesn't matter
05:49
south to north but anyway you have lines
05:52
that are
05:54
perpendicular to each other that means a
05:56
90 degree angle and they make
05:58
squares on your map so you have a map
06:00
and you make these small squares on your
06:02
map
06:02
so that you can easily find out where
06:06
something is like i said you say oh my
06:08
house is located in
06:09
h4 now my house is in that square
06:12
okay great now you can make the square
06:14
small or you can make the squares big
06:17
right so depending on how exact or
06:20
detailed
06:20
you want the map coordinates
06:24
to be coordinates are a set of numbers
06:27
that tell you where something is on a
06:30
map
06:31
okay and the gps system that you might
06:33
use in your phone
06:35
uses the same system okay
06:40
next we have separate separate means
06:42
apart from each other they're not
06:43
together
06:44
they are separate okay so it just means
06:47
apart from each other we have a
06:48
this is a very interesting picture isn't
06:50
it those are weird looking up office
06:51
buildings
06:52
it looks like they're going to fall oh
06:54
no no of course i'm sure they're
06:55
engineered
06:56
so that they do not fall but they're
06:58
pretty cool looking right this is kind
07:00
of
07:00
cool architecture right okay so of
07:03
course
07:04
the the office buildings were probably
07:07
built by the same
07:08
builder maybe the same architect made
07:10
them of course because it would look
07:11
silly if there was just one of them
07:13
what's going on so you have two of them
07:16
but they're not
07:17
together physically they are separate of
07:19
course they are together
07:20
aesthetically in in terms of their
07:23
design
07:23
they're together but they are they're
07:25
not touching each other they are
07:28
separate
07:30
envelope some people say envelope
07:32
envelope
07:33
doesn't matter it does you know nobody's
07:35
going to care which way you say it
07:37
envelope or envelope most people i think
07:39
say envelope
07:41
envelope of course is a paper container
07:43
in which people put a letter or a card
07:46
of course if somebody has a birthday you
07:48
get them a birthday card right you sign
07:50
the inside of the birthday card
07:51
then you close the card and you put it
07:53
inside an
07:54
envelope and then you give it to the
07:56
person you put the person's name
07:58
on it right well a long time ago
08:01
before you were born people used to send
08:03
paper to each other
08:05
and they called these things letters
08:08
okay they would write on a piece of
08:10
paper their message they would
08:12
fold it up put it in an envelope and
08:13
they would go to the post office
08:15
and mail it it takes maybe a day
08:17
sometimes several days depending on how
08:19
far away you're sending your letter the
08:22
other person would receive it and read
08:23
your letter
08:24
yeah that was before email of course you
08:27
have probably have no idea
08:28
so anyway an envelope when you did that
08:31
you had to put the address right
08:33
on the envelope of course nowadays we
08:36
still use that but most
08:37
most of the time it's just boxes and
08:39
company like you order something on the
08:41
internet
08:41
and the company will send it to you but
08:43
they put their address not on an
08:45
envelope it's in a box because you
08:46
ordered some goods
08:48
but they still put your address on it so
08:51
just
08:51
basically an envelope is a paper
08:53
container in which people put
08:54
a letter or card the idea of course is
08:57
that we're writing the address
08:59
here of course nowadays you're more
09:02
familiar with boxes
09:03
same idea you still have to write
09:05
somebody's address
09:07
on this uh in this space so that the
09:09
letter or the box
09:11
gets to your house okay those
09:14
are our words for today okay let's talk
09:17
about the first main idea in this lesson
09:20
and by the way i should point something
09:22
out right away so you don't get confused
09:25
in your book you might see that at the
09:27
top in the book it says
09:29
rose and over here it says columns
09:33
in your book sorry about that that may
09:36
have been a misprint
09:37
but it should be columns these a
09:40
b c and d are columns
09:44
one two three four are rows so
09:47
you can just make that change in your
09:49
book okay
09:50
and you know sometimes mistakes are made
09:53
printing mistakes are kind of common
09:55
unfortunately
09:56
okay so anyway this is using
09:59
a map grid okay and we talked about this
10:03
already in the vocabulary right i said
10:05
you know you have their
10:05
your columns across the top a b c d
10:08
usually they use numbers at the top
10:10
and they use letters are sorry let me
10:13
switch that around
10:14
they use letters across the top a b
10:17
c d and they use numbers for the rows
10:20
going down
10:21
that's very typical for example you're
10:24
maybe too young to use microsoft excel
10:26
but that's what they do for that program
10:29
that's very common uh technique or a
10:32
very common method
10:34
so as we can see using a
10:37
map grid is really convenient because we
10:40
can find these places
10:42
that are over here on the map key now
10:45
what by the way we have a key
10:46
key what do you mean key is it a key
10:49
like you open a door
10:51
no on a key on a map just
10:54
explains what symbols mean so if you
10:57
have a symbol
10:58
you see this little picture this is a
11:00
symbol you say what is that symbol
11:02
well in the key it explains that this
11:04
symbol what does it mean it means nick's
11:06
home
11:07
and over here you see an envelope right
11:10
and you say
11:10
what is that symbol what is that symbol
11:12
for and it says post office
11:14
that is what the key does it shows you
11:17
the symbol that appears on the map
11:18
and then explains what that symbol is
11:21
and that is a map key
11:23
sometimes people call it a legend
11:26
legend but most of the time people call
11:30
it a key
11:31
a map key so we have school we have
11:34
hospital we have a library and all
11:35
that's what these symbols mean
11:37
now if you want to know like in your
11:39
town where
11:40
are these places well for example where
11:42
is nick's home
11:43
right he invited you over for his
11:45
birthday party you prepared a card in an
11:48
envelope right
11:49
so don't go to the envelope simple go to
11:51
nick's home
11:52
where is nick's home on the map grid we
11:54
can find it very easily right
11:56
where is it it's in b
11:59
one right because the intersection of
12:01
one and b
12:03
ta-dah there's nick's house so you can
12:06
see
12:06
a map grid is really convenient it's
12:09
very easy
12:10
to find things using a map grid let's do
12:13
one more
12:14
where is the hospital well
12:18
we need to find this symbol right here
12:20
because in the key
12:22
it tells us this symbol is the hospital
12:25
so here's the hospital here but on the
12:27
map grid where is it
12:29
well we can see it's in column c and
12:32
it's in
12:33
row four so the hospital is in
12:36
c c4 that's where the hospital is
12:40
so using a grid is very easy when you're
12:43
finding things
12:45
on a map great okay so and
12:48
by the way we talked about absolute
12:50
location and relative location
12:52
so if we say absolute location if we use
12:55
the map grid
12:56
that tells us exactly precisely
12:59
where nick's house is so that is
13:02
absolute location when we say
13:04
nick's house is in b1
13:07
right so that's absolute location same
13:09
thing for the hospital
13:10
absolute the absolute location of the
13:13
hospital
13:14
is c4 that is the absolute location
13:19
but what about relative location
13:21
remember relative location
13:22
you're comparing the location of one
13:25
thing to the location
13:27
of something else so if again if we look
13:30
at nick's house as an example
13:32
and we want to compare it with something
13:34
else well we see the
13:35
post office right the post office is
13:39
next to nick's house so we can use that
13:43
as the
13:43
relative location we can say nick's
13:46
house is
13:47
near the post office or you can also say
13:50
next to because it's
13:52
it's uh it's in the next block over it's
13:55
in the next
13:55
building over it's next to it's next to
13:59
the post office
14:00
or it's near if it's near it doesn't
14:02
have to be
14:03
right next to it it could be a couple
14:05
buildings away but it's
14:07
close right so next two means the two
14:10
buildings are right next to each other
14:12
but near it could be next to or it could
14:15
be one or two buildings
14:16
away from it okay but it's just near so
14:20
nick's house is near the post office
14:22
that is relative
14:23
location okay so we can use maps
14:26
to find both the absolute and relative
14:29
locations
14:30
of places and of course this is very
14:32
helpful when you're
14:34
out in the city and you're going to
14:36
someplace new you've never been there
14:38
before
14:39
so you need to know either the relative
14:41
location or the
14:42
absolute location of something now of
14:45
course absolute location this is one way
14:47
to find absolute location
14:49
but another way to find absolute
14:51
location is not using a map grid it's
14:53
using something else
14:56
and that's something else is the address
15:00
right now the address also tells you the
15:03
absolute location it doesn't use a map
15:05
grid
15:06
it uses a system of numbers and street
15:09
names
15:10
and city or village name city a village
15:14
town or city names
15:15
sometimes you can also use the country
15:17
name if you're sending something to
15:19
another country you have to put the
15:20
country on it as well
15:22
so address your address is an absolute
15:25
location
15:26
because it tells everybody exactly
15:29
precisely where something is located
15:33
now we talked about this before when we
15:35
talked about the letter and i
15:37
i told you you guys don't use letters
15:39
anymore but you can still see it of
15:40
course on packages that are sent to your
15:42
home
15:44
you have to write the address on an
15:47
envelope when you send a letter now
15:50
different countries have
15:51
different postal systems so
15:55
the way that you write your address
15:57
might be different
15:58
from some the way somebody else uses an
16:02
address
16:02
in america when you send something to
16:05
somebody
16:06
you write their address usually of
16:08
course you put their name so let's use
16:09
my name for example
16:11
you would write you're sending something
16:12
to me you would write brian
16:14
stewart at the top at the top
16:17
for example here and you can see the
16:19
name right here i'm rewriting it because
16:21
it's a little difficult to see it
16:23
you shouldn't write an address like this
16:24
it's a little difficult to see
16:26
but you see what is his address is that
16:28
then there's a number
16:29
200 i have no idea
16:33
okay let's just say let's just say it's
16:36
200
16:37
and i'm i'm gonna guess i think it's
16:38
schwab
16:40
uh s let's i'll just write it it doesn't
16:43
matter
16:44
schwab and then i don't know what that
16:46
is let's just say it's avenue
16:48
now in america there's many names for
16:50
streets sometimes people will put
16:52
s t that means street or they'll put a v
16:55
e i think that's what this is
16:56
and ave stands for avenue
16:59
so there's many words for streets i
17:01
think we covered this in a previous
17:03
lesson so the street
17:04
avenue boulevard there's a lot of
17:08
different names for streets
17:09
but anyway that's the name of the street
17:11
and this is the number so the post
17:14
office person when they're going down
17:16
the street there's numbers on
17:18
each building and they say you know if
17:19
they're going down schwab avenue
17:21
they start you know maybe with uh 100
17:24
and they kind of keep going until they
17:25
hit
17:26
200 and then they find your house of
17:28
course where is it
17:30
now what is this here uh this is a
17:34
the name of a
17:37
ah i think it's k oh it's cambridge okay
17:39
uh
17:40
but again don't write like that because
17:42
that's horrible
17:43
the post the postal the postal post
17:46
service worker
17:47
will have a very difficult time reading
17:50
your address so be
17:51
very clear and write carefully
17:54
cambridge how they spell that cambridge
17:58
cambridge what is that massachusetts
18:01
maybe
18:02
yeah okay massachusetts there is a
18:04
cambridge in massachusetts
18:06
and m-a-s-s is the abbreviation for the
18:09
state
18:09
again in america you don't have to write
18:11
the whole name massachusetts
18:12
that's a really long difficult name
18:14
mississippi oh my gosh
18:16
so you don't have to write the whole
18:18
name of the state people abbreviate them
18:21
right sometimes it's just two letters
18:23
like nevada is
18:24
nv right california c a period
18:28
right in this case massachusetts m-a-s-s
18:31
period
18:32
you don't have to write out the whole
18:33
name of the state and then what are the
18:35
what's this over here this is what we
18:37
call the zip code
18:38
and again the handwriting is horrible
18:40
that looks like a b
18:42
but b doesn't exist in a zip code it
18:44
should be
18:45
all letters so i think it's 1 3
18:48
2 4 9. looks like maybe 2 4 9. again
18:52
it's hard if if i was a postal service
18:55
worker
18:56
and i saw this i would send it back to
18:58
the person who was trying to deliver it
19:00
because this is horrible that's
19:02
the handwriting is terrible again if
19:04
you're going to write an address on
19:05
something
19:05
make sure you write clearly
19:09
okay make sure that the person uh the
19:12
post office
19:12
people the people who work in the post
19:14
office can read the address
19:16
on the box that you're sending or the
19:18
package that you're sending
19:20
okay this is this is terrible okay so
19:22
anyway you write it out so you have your
19:24
name
19:24
you have the street address and then you
19:26
have the name of the city
19:28
the state and then the zip code the zip
19:30
code is very important because the post
19:31
office system
19:32
in america has a zip code that number
19:35
tells them the location so
19:36
even if they can't read you know your
19:38
writing in some parts
19:40
they can they can figure out the town
19:42
and the state by the zip code easily now
19:44
it might be a little bit more difficult
19:45
the street address
19:46
that's a little bit more difficult
19:48
because the zip code is for a large
19:50
area but anyway zip code is very
19:51
important and you should include that if
19:53
you're sending something
19:54
to an address in america and of course
19:56
like i said before many different
19:58
countries have different systems
20:00
so make sure you know the system and it
20:01
could be different for a different
20:03
country you know maybe they put
20:04
the the sometimes i see sometimes they
20:06
put the city first right
20:08
and then they put the street address or
20:10
they don't have street names
20:12
okay i've seen that also it's just
20:13
numbers and maybe a location
20:16
so it depends okay but that ad
20:19
that's an address and that address tells
20:21
the absolute the precise exact
20:24
location of the the house the apartment
20:28
the office building
20:29
whatever the place is that you're
20:31
sending the package to
20:33
okay let's move on
20:38
now it's time to do the reading and as
20:40
usual i will read out loud you guys can
20:42
repeat after me out loud or
20:44
in your head let's focus on the
20:46
vocabulary that we learned
20:48
and also pick up some new words maybe
20:51
along the way
20:52
you guys ready let's begin
20:55
everything has a location
20:58
we can use maps to find the location
21:02
of something there are two kinds
21:06
of location absolute location
21:10
and relative location
21:15
to take an example nick
21:18
lives in west lake
21:22
the absolute location of nick's house
21:26
is 17 crumble
21:30
street westlake
21:33
it is the address of nick's
21:36
house the relative location
21:40
of nick's house is near the post office
21:45
it's easy to find nick's house
21:48
on a map
21:52
using the columns and rows
21:56
of a map grid his house
22:00
can be found on the map
22:04
both of them show the location of nick's
22:07
house the map shows both
22:11
the absolute and relative
22:14
locations
22:18
sometimes nick writes letters
22:22
to his uncle his uncle lives
22:25
in a separate town from nick's family
22:30
nick has to write his absolute location
22:34
on the envelope before he posts
22:39
the letter just want to point out
22:42
something
22:42
post the letter you can also say mail
22:44
the letter
22:45
i think post is more common
22:49
in british english most americans will
22:52
just say
22:53
mail so post and post isn't just for
22:58
the verb it's also the noun a lot of br
23:01
you know if you're
23:02
if you're in england or britain people
23:03
might say did you receive anything
23:05
in the post that means did you receive
23:08
any letters or packages
23:10
in the mail an american would say did
23:11
you receive anything
23:13
in the mail or what's in the mail today
23:16
a british person would say what's in the
23:18
post today so a little bit difference
23:20
between
23:21
the two words between british english
23:23
and american english interesting
23:25
anyway so we can see that you know nick
23:27
writes letters wow
23:29
he's using old technology maybe but you
23:32
know sometimes people like to write
23:33
letters because
23:35
it's more personal right it's it's a
23:37
little bit
23:38
it shows more effort if you write a
23:40
letter than just writing an email
23:42
of course you know 99.9 of people
23:45
just write emails these days but you
23:47
know sometimes you can send a letter
23:49
it's
23:50
it's nicer right it's more personal
23:52
shows that you're making more effort
23:54
it's up to you okay
23:57
let's see how this reading passage was
24:00
organized in this case we have
24:02
compare and contrast and of course we're
24:04
talking about two different things
24:06
in this unit right absolute location and
24:09
relative location so let's compare the
24:12
two here we have
24:12
absolute location on the left
24:16
and we have relative location on the
24:19
right by the way on the left on the
24:20
right
24:21
relative location because we're
24:23
comparing okay
24:24
okay so absolute location here we have
24:27
nick's house is 17
24:28
crumble street what was the town in
24:31
which
24:32
he lived according to the reading did
24:33
you catch it it was
24:35
west lake west lake
24:39
and now if you want to be very specific
24:41
right you could also put the state
24:44
and then of course you'd put the zip
24:45
code after that so you'd put the state
24:48
and the zip code and that is the
24:50
complete address
24:51
and if you're mailing to another country
24:53
you'd put the country name underneath as
24:54
well
24:55
but anyway 17 crumble street westlake
24:59
now a relative location what is nick's
25:01
house near
25:03
and don't say near two there's no reason
25:05
to say near two just say near
25:07
uh don't say it's near to blah blah blah
25:09
no it's just near
25:10
okay that's that's enough okay so nick's
25:13
house is
25:13
near the what do you remember from the
25:16
reading it's near the post office right
25:18
they said
25:19
it is near the post office
25:22
two words post office
25:26
so nick's house can be found on the map
25:28
using columns and rows
25:30
of a what remember we talked about this
25:32
quite a bit actually
25:33
you know you have your columns you know
25:36
going up and down you have your rows
25:37
going across
25:38
and we call that a grid what kind of
25:40
grid it's a map grid so
25:42
here we have two words also map
25:45
grid oh yeah i spelled it right okay
25:47
good
25:48
nick's house can be found on the map
25:50
using columns and rows
25:52
of a map grid and of course when you
25:54
make squares
25:55
on a map that's called a grid now
25:59
both of them both the absolute location
26:02
and the relative location show the what
26:05
of nick's house of course that's what
26:06
we're talking about in this unit
26:08
we're talking about the location of
26:10
things so
26:11
show the location location
26:15
location of nick's house okay
26:19
and that's how we know where things are
26:21
and of course it's especially important
26:23
when you want to send
26:25
a letter or most often nowadays packages
26:29
to a certain a home an apartment an
26:32
office whatever
26:33
a company you want to send a package to
26:36
them
26:36
you need to know the absolute location
26:38
and you write the absolute location
26:40
of course we don't use map grids don't
26:43
send a box to
26:44
h6 that's the map grid right because
26:48
you know different people will have
26:49
different maps you know the
26:51
the grids will be different right but
26:53
the addresses
26:54
are always the same the address is the
26:56
best way to send a package
26:58
don't send the package saying h6 because
27:00
the post i was gonna go
27:01
h6 on what map right so use the
27:04
address okay but you know if you
27:08
and your friend or somebody else has the
27:10
same map with the same map grid
27:12
then you can use the map grid but
27:14
usually we don't do that
27:16
but like i said before gps does use a
27:19
map grid that's used by everybody in the
27:21
world
27:22
and that's how gps works global
27:24
positioning
27:25
satellites that system works our global
27:27
positioning system
27:28
but that's very precise the military
27:30
uses that and other people
27:32
as well who want to be very precise in
27:35
their location
27:36
that's using a grid system but of course
27:38
most people will just use addresses
27:40
to either send a package or if you're
27:42
going to a new place
27:43
and you want to visit a museum
27:46
you want to find a movie theater you
27:48
want to find somebody's house or
27:49
somebody's office building
27:51
you use an address okay well that's it
27:54
for this lesson
27:55
now we know how to get around
27:58
in the world using maps grids and
28:01
especially
28:02
addresses thanks for standing with me
28:05
hope you enjoyed this lesson and learned
28:07
a lot
28:08
we'll see you in the next one take care
28:09
everybody bye bye
28:17
you
