to talk about
in the next few lessons in lesson 13
we're going to be talking about edison
do you know thomas edison edison
the wizard edison the wizard so we'll
talk about him
because he is a good hero in this unit
we will focus on thomas edison
was a great inventor that's
what we'll talk about in this unit so
let's take a look
first of all we can see this is a good
picture
of thomas edison right who invented the
light bulb
of course it was thomas edison and
many inventions were made by
thomas edison
and this is a good picture right very
interesting of course it's a small light
bulb it's not big
it's the way they took the picture but
we can see thomas edison
on the other side of the light bulb and
he is credited with inventing the light
bulb
he made many wonderful inventions
you saw on the slide before it said
edison the wizard
sometimes when you think about wizard
you think oh
the wizard of oz but actually do you
know
thomas edison was called the wizard
of not not the wizard of oz
the wizard of menlow park
because menlo park that was the name
of the place where his laboratory was
and he made many inventions at this
laboratory
and people were amazed it was like magic
so they called him a wizard the wizard
of menlow park
not the wizard of oz the wizard of
menlow park
it's in new jersey next to new york
okay let's start with the lesson of
course with the vocabulary
and the first word on our word list is
this one number one the definition is
here
a stick that burns to give us
light a stick that burns to give us
light
maybe you think if you're watching old
movies like
uh you know some science uh not science
fiction but fantasy movie
where they have swords they have lots of
sticks that burn
you could call it a torch but we don't
we're not looking for that word that's a
different kind of stick
we're looking for this type of stick
actually a very small stick here it's
made of wax
it uses wax what is it of course
it's a candle a candle uses
wax it's a stick of wax
that burns to give us light and they're
very common
before the light bulb they were really
really common right
okay second word someone
who makes new things so here we see
maybe this is a picture of thomas edison
when he was young
right two different pictures right look
like different people
i think this is a picture of thomas
edison when he's young
this is a picture of somebody using a
record player
a long long time ago maybe you don't
even know what a record player is
but before mp3 file
before cd right before
uh your disks your tapes you we had
records
and this is the person who invented the
record player
someone who makes new things anybody
who makes new things is called an
inventor
in ventur in then tur
so inventor inventor
a person who makes new things okay
will you be an inventor when you grow up
maybe
if you have some good ideas right okay
next word number three
to make something better to make
something better
to do what is to improve
improve improve
improve to improve that means you make
it
better to make something better docho i
o right
you always want to get better you want
to make
something better you want to improve
number four to be on fire right
to be on fire means to burn
so if somebody wants to make a campfire
right it's cold outside you're in the
mountains
you make a campfire you want to burn
some wood burn some wood
to be on fire means to burn okay
hopefully the only thing that burns is
the wood in your campfire
not a house or something else right we
don't want that
okay but if it's on fire we say it is
burning
to burn okay number five oh
we saw this uh word before right i was
joking about the wizard of oz
and i talked about thomas edison as the
wizard of menlo
park someone who can do magic
is a wizard wizard
you probably know harry potter right
harry potter
is a wizard right
so someone who can do magic is called a
wizard now
thomas edison didn't do magic but his
inventions were
amazing people thought they thought wow
there's light from a light bulb it's the
first time people saw
that so they thought they thought it was
magic
so they called him a wizard wizard
wizard okay next one
something that gives light so what is
this thing over here
it gives light you turn it on click it
is of course a lamp
and you have a small lamp this is a
table
lamp a table lamp
because it's on a small table we say
it's a table lamp
if the lamp is on the floor don't say
it's a stand
or stand lamp we just call that a floor
lamp
so that's very easy floor lamp
okay so table lamp and then a big lamp
that you put on the floor
floor lamp it depends where is it
it's on the table it's a table lamp it's
on the floor
it's a floor lamp very simple okay but
that's a lamp
okay seven an element found in
all living things that's a difficult one
to figure out just from the definition
because there are many
elements in living things right but look
at the picture here
this is a type of rock it's very black
right and uh actually it can burn
if you you if you set it on fire it's
carbon
carbon carbon can be found in all living
things
carbon carbon carbon
so an element found in all living things
next eight easy to do something that's
easy to do three plus three six
four plus four eight all normal should i

simple simple it's simple it's
easy pandero right it's the
opposite of difficult opposite of
difficult
difficult pandero simple it is
simple okay next one number nine
to need money to buy you need
money to buy something it's the cost

you say how much does something cost how
much
how much does
it cost
so how much money do i need to
buy this thing over here this bucket
of looks like plums is three dollars
sam chanwan right three dollars about
sam chanwan
how much does it cost um right how much
does it
cost cost and be careful because cost
is an irregular verb so we say cost
cost cost not costed just cost
how much does it cost it cost 10
how much did your jacket cost i bought
it yesterday
it cost ten dollars right so cost
cost cost okay number ten
to make something start working
in our lives these days there are many
machines right
how do we make them start working we
turn it
on especially when it has electricity
right we use electricity to turn
something on turn it on turn on the
light
turn on your computer turn on your cell
phone
turn on is very useful to us because
our lives are surrounded by machines
we turn them on turn it
on or turn on your phone okay
number 11 cute rabbit right
very cute rabbit special powers that
make strange things happen
if you know somebody who has a hat
and they take their hat off and they
pull a rabbit out of their hat
you say wow that's magic
that's magic it's a special power
that makes strange things happen harry
potter right with his wand
he can make strange things happen
because he has special
powers and it's called magic of course
magic isn't real right okay we just
think about it
magic it's just imagination
number 12 the glass part of a lamp
so the glass part of the lamp right just
the glass we call that
a light bulb so if you talk about
just the glass here that's the bulb
right but actually the whole thing is a
light bulb
light bulb and you screw in you see this
bottom part here
if the light it's break kojang maseo
right
you take a new light and you screw it in
screw it
whoops screw it in
screw it in but be careful make sure the
light is off before you screw it in
because
you'll be surprised and it's hot right
so be careful okay screw it in light
bulb
okay next one number 13
to make an effort to make an
effort to do something it's very simple
right
you're going to try every day
you try to do things most of the time
you're successful
especially easy simple things you try to
do them
you're successful sometimes you try to
do something
and you can't do it it's too hard but
keep trying
one day you will succeed so keep
trying try something make an effort
keep making an effort work hard
study hard play hard right keep
making an effort keep trying you will
succeed
next one whoa lots of money here right
this guy's rich
what you use to buy something i just
said of course
it's money and this is a lot of money
right
tone man i'll right this is shipman one
shipment one shipment one shipment one
shipment one shipment one shipment one
wow that's a lot of money that's like
more than more than beg man one here
right because each one is a one hundred
dollars
one hundred dollars is about shipman one
that's
a lot of money a lot
of we usually use a lot of with money
he has a lot of money or
i have a lot of money but i don't have a
lot of money
i i don't have much money okay
don't have much money or a lot of money
so we use those
to describe money next one
well he's going fast right to happen
fast to happen fast is quickly
if something happens fast it's very done
very quickly right it's done very
quickly
quickly to run quickly to deliver
something quickly quickly
next one now at a slow speed right we
just saw
quickly does a snail move quickly no
a snail moves at a slow speed
so a snail moves slowly
slowly you don't have to say slowly
just slowly right but it means very
slow at a slow speed like a snail
a snail is very slow oh no mo
right i have to wait a long time slowly
okay okay let's get into the exercises
with those words
complete each sentence with a word from
the box
so we have our sentences here but
there's one word
missing we have to fill in that word
with the words from the box let's review
the words first one candles
candles next one improved
improved notice the d at the end
that makes it an adjective right it is
improved it has improved you could also
use it as an
as a verb past tense but we say it is
improved or it has improved okay
sometimes it's used as an adjective
sometimes as a verb
improved simple
simple next one wizard
wizard next one burned
burned notice the past tense right
inventor inventor
next one carbon carbon
and the last one lamp
lamp okay put your tongue behind your
top teeth
okay okay number one it is dark
it's dark no light we need to turn
on the what if it's dark in your room
what do you turn on to get light of
course
you turn on a lamp we need to turn
on the lamp okay next one number two
and beep makes new things and
and look at a n that's a clue isn't it
we need a vowel here right
so let's take a look here a what
what makes new things we're probably
looking for a person
and it has to start with a vowel so
we're looking probably right there right
and inventor makes new things because
i is a vowel an inventor
not a inventor an inventor
makes new things and that's of course an
inventor
is a person who makes new things that's
what we learned
number three a beep can do magic
now we're looking for a probably another
person
but somebody who can do magic who is
that right
out of these words who can do magic
pink probably a wizard a wizard can
do magic okay so when we use magic
we usually use do he can do
magic a wizard can do magic harry potter
can do magic a wizard can do magic
okay the next six are the next three
long ago
long ago right long time ago oriented
i'm sorry gennady
long ago people used beep to see
in the dark what did they use to see in
the dark
before the light bulb long ago
before electricity before changi right
what what did people use to see in the
dark
they used candles people used
candles to see in the dark
number five thomas edison beep
the light bulb what did thomas edison
do right and remember it's past tense so
remember those past tense words we
talked about
thomas edison improved the light bulb
he improved it so maybe it was already
made or invented and he made it better
or maybe he invented it and he made it
better we'll find out in the reading
but of course the light bulb nowadays is
not the light bulb
that was first invented right people
improve inventions they make them better
just think about computers when
computers first came they were
huge and they were very slow nowadays
your cell phone is faster than a
computer
60 years ago right okay so things are
improving
right thomas edison improved the light
bulb
number six before edison light bulbs
beep
too quickly what did they do they
burned too quickly before edison light
bulbs
burned too quickly so the light bulb
burned
it's gone right too quickly thomas
edison
improved the light bulb sounds like he
made it last
longer now we'll see that in the reading
okay next two
seven and eight edison made his light
bulb
with what what did he make his light
bulb with
what element did thomas edison
make his light bulb with it's hard to
know because we haven't done the reading
yet
but if you think about what word would
fit
it would be carbon because carbon is an
element
that is used to make things so thomas
edison made his light bulb with
carbon it lasted longer
eight if it is beep then it is easy to
do we talked about that before you can
get this one
we don't need to look at the reading if
something is easy to do
it is what it is simple if it is
simple then it is easy to do
okay that wraps up the vocabulary
exercises
as you can see there are a couple of
sentences that sound like they're from
the reading right
so we're going to look at the reading
next after this short break

first of all we can see this is a good
00:57
picture
00:57
of thomas edison right who invented the
01:01
light bulb
01:02
of course it was thomas edison and
01:05
many inventions were made by
01:08
thomas edison
01:12
and this is a good picture right very
01:15
interesting of course it's a small light
01:16
bulb it's not big
01:18
it's the way they took the picture but
01:20
we can see thomas edison
01:21
on the other side of the light bulb and
01:24
he is credited with inventing the light
01:27
bulb
01:27
he made many wonderful inventions
01:30
you saw on the slide before it said
01:33
edison the wizard
01:35
sometimes when you think about wizard

01:41
thomas edison was called the wizard
01:46

02:04
laboratory
02:05
and people were amazed it was like magic

not the wizard of oz the wizard of
02:15
menlow park
02:16
it's in new jersey next to new york
02:19
okay let's start with the lesson of
02:22
course with the vocabulary
02:24
and the first word on our word list is
02:27
this one number one the definition is
02:29
here
02:30
a stick that burns to give us
02:33
light a stick that burns to give us
02:36
light
02:37
maybe you think if you're watching old
02:39
movies like
02:40
uh you know some science uh not science
02:43
fiction but fantasy movie
02:45
where they have swords they have lots of
02:47
sticks that burn
02:48
you could call it a torch but we don't
02:52
we're not looking for that word that's a
02:54
different kind of stick
02:55
we're looking for this type of stick
02:58
actually a very small stick here it's
03:00
made of wax
03:02
it uses wax what is it of course
03:06
it's a candle a candle uses
03:09
wax it's a stick of wax
03:12
that burns to give us light and they're
03:15
very common
03:16
before the light bulb they were really
03:18
really common right
03:20
okay second word someone
03:23
who makes new things so here we see
03:27
maybe this is a picture of thomas edison
03:29
when he was young
03:30
right two different pictures right look
03:33
like different people
03:34
i think this is a picture of thomas
03:36
edison when he's young
03:37
this is a picture of somebody using a
03:40
record player
03:41
a long long time ago maybe you don't
03:43
even know what a record player is
03:46
but before mp3 file
03:49
before cd right before
03:52
uh your disks your tapes you we had
03:55
records
03:56
and this is the person who invented the
03:59
record player
04:00
someone who makes new things anybody
04:04
who makes new things is called an
04:06
inventor
04:07
in ventur in then tur
04:11
so inventor inventor
04:14
a person who makes new things okay
04:18
will you be an inventor when you grow up
04:20
maybe
04:21
if you have some good ideas right okay
04:24

mountains
05:05

05:19
not a house or something else right we
05:21
don't want that
05:22
okay but if it's on fire we say it is

05:41
is a wizard wizard
05:44
you probably know harry potter right
05:46
harry potter
05:48

05:51
so someone who can do magic is called a
05:53
wizard now
05:54
thomas edison didn't do magic but his
05:58
inventions were
05:59
amazing people thought they thought wow

06:40
it's a stand
06:42
or stand lamp we just call that a floor
06:44

06:53
floor lamp it depends where is it
06:56

07:04
okay seven an element found in
07:08

fast to happen fast is quickly
13:09
if something happens fast it's very done

13:30
a snail moves at a slow speed
13:33
so a snail moves slowly
13:37
slowly you don't have to say slowly
13:41
just slowly right but it means very
13:44
slow at a slow speed like a snail
13:48
a snail is very slow oh no mo
13:51
right i have to wait a long time slowly
13:54
okay okay let's get into the exercises
13:58
with those words
14:00
complete each sentence with a word from
14:02
the box
14:03
so we have our sentences here but
14:05
there's one word
14:06
missing we have to fill in that word
14:10
with the words from the box let's review
14:13
the words first one candles
14:17
candles next one improved
14:22
improved notice the d at the end
14:26
that makes it an adjective right it is
14:29
improved it has improved you could also
14:32
use it as an
14:33
as a verb past tense but we say it is
14:36
improved or it has improved okay
14:39
sometimes it's used as an adjective
14:41
sometimes as a verb
14:43
improved simple
14:47
simple next one wizard
14:51
wizard next one burned
14:55
burned notice the past tense right
14:59
inventor inventor
15:03
next one carbon carbon
15:06
and the last one lamp
15:09
lamp okay put your tongue behind your
15:12
top teeth
15:14
okay okay number one it is dark
15:18
it's dark no light we need to turn
15:21
on the what if it's dark in your room
15:25
what do you turn on to get light of
15:28
course
15:28
you turn on a lamp we need to turn
15:32
on the lamp okay next one number two
15:35
and beep makes new things and
15:39
and look at a n that's a clue isn't it
15:42
we need a vowel here right
15:44
so let's take a look here a what
15:48
what makes new things we're probably
15:50
looking for a person
15:52
and it has to start with a vowel so
15:55
we're looking probably right there right
15:58
and inventor makes new things because
16:00
i is a vowel an inventor
16:03
not a inventor an inventor
16:06
makes new things and that's of course an
16:09
inventor
16:10
is a person who makes new things that's
16:12
what we learned
16:13
number three a beep can do magic
16:17
now we're looking for a probably another
16:20
person
16:21
but somebody who can do magic who is
16:23
that right
16:24
out of these words who can do magic
16:27
pink probably a wizard a wizard can
16:30
do magic okay so when we use magic
16:34
we usually use do he can do
16:37
magic a wizard can do magic harry potter
16:42
can do magic a wizard can do magic
16:45
okay the next six are the next three
16:49
long ago
16:50
long ago right long time ago oriented
16:54
i'm sorry gennady
16:56
long ago people used beep to see
16:59
in the dark what did they use to see in
17:02
the dark
17:02
before the light bulb long ago
17:06
before electricity before changi right
17:10
what what did people use to see in the
17:12
dark
17:14
they used candles people used
17:17
candles to see in the dark
17:20
number five thomas edison beep
17:24
the light bulb what did thomas edison
17:27
do right and remember it's past tense so
17:30
remember those past tense words we
17:31
talked about
17:33
thomas edison improved the light bulb
17:36
he improved it so maybe it was already
17:39
made or invented and he made it better
17:42
or maybe he invented it and he made it
17:44
better we'll find out in the reading
17:46
but of course the light bulb nowadays is
17:49
not the light bulb
17:51
that was first invented right people
17:54
improve inventions they make them better
17:56
just think about computers when
17:58
computers first came they were
18:00
huge and they were very slow nowadays
18:03
your cell phone is faster than a
18:05
computer
18:06
60 years ago right okay so things are
18:10
improving
18:11
right thomas edison improved the light
18:13
bulb
18:14
number six before edison light bulbs
18:18
beep
18:18
too quickly what did they do they
18:22
burned too quickly before edison light
18:25
bulbs
18:26
burned too quickly so the light bulb
18:29
burned
18:30
it's gone right too quickly thomas
18:33
edison
18:33
improved the light bulb sounds like he
18:36
made it last
18:37
longer now we'll see that in the reading
18:40
okay next two
18:41
seven and eight edison made his light
18:43
bulb
18:44
with what what did he make his light
18:47
bulb with
18:48
what element did thomas edison
18:51
make his light bulb with it's hard to
18:53
know because we haven't done the reading
18:55
yet
18:56
but if you think about what word would
18:58
fit
18:59
it would be carbon because carbon is an
19:01
element
19:02
that is used to make things so thomas
19:06
edison made his light bulb with
19:08
carbon it lasted longer
19:11
eight if it is beep then it is easy to
19:15
do we talked about that before you can
19:16
get this one
19:18
we don't need to look at the reading if
19:20
something is easy to do
19:22
it is what it is simple if it is
19:25
simple then it is easy to do
19:29
okay that wraps up the vocabulary
19:31
exercises
19:33
as you can see there are a couple of
19:34
sentences that sound like they're from
19:36
the reading right
19:38
so we're going to look at the reading
19:39
next after this short break
