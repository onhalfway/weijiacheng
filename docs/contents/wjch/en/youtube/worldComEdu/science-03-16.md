okay so
let's go over the vocabulary the first
word is
live as in to live
live to live means to be alive to be
in the process of being alive
now be careful with live because it can
also be pronounced in another way you
can pronounce this
live but that has a different meaning
if you say live that is an adjective
right so live here this live
is a verb right to live
i want to live a long time
but live as an adjective
we can say it is a live concert
right that means that people are playing
it's not recorded music
people are actually playing the music
you can see
the people it's live music live
concert but live okay so be careful live
live okay in this case live
live means to be alive next word is to
grow
things that live
grow they grow during their lives
right they become bigger or taller over
a period of time
you are growing right now right
you can't see it right grow to grow
usually means
it takes a long time right it takes many
months maybe years for you to notice a
change as you grow but some animals grow
very quickly
right like pets dogs and cats they grow
very quickly you still hard to see you
don't see it right happening right now
but you know over weeks or months very
quickly they
change they grow they become bigger
or taller our next word
is to change to change means to become
different that's a good picture right
you've all seen an
egg right sometimes you eat eggs for
breakfast right well those are not
eggs that will become chickens don't
worry but they are
but an egg that is able to become a
chicken will
hatch after a while right the egg will
change
it'll break open and a little chick will
come out of it
that's a big change right to become
different you also change right when you
were a baby
now you were a child or a teenager
you changed right and you will continue
to change
through your life we all do okay
reproduce reproduce
reproduce reproduce means to make
more living things of the same kind
all living things are able to
reproduce that means that they can make
more
living things that look like them when
you get older you might get married and
have
children that means you will reproduce
right
when your dog gets older it can meet
another dog
become a parent and they will have
children right
plants when they get older they send out
seeds or pollen and they will reproduce
and
more plants will grow so to make more
living things
of the same kind that's to reproduce
next word is a sad word
die to no longer be alive
here we have a sad picture of a bird
probably an old bird who became too
old and then died all living things
become old and die it's part of life
the thing is enjoy your life while
you're live while you
while you are living right to enjoy your
life and be good to other people that's
the important thing
okay our next word is move to move
to move means to go from place a to
place b
right something is at place a and it
moves
over to place b now here we have a
picture
of a snail snails are famous
for moving very slowly somebody might
say oh
you move like a snail means you
move very slowly
and probably not a good idea especially
if you're going to school
okay so actually we have a video of a
snail moving
and you can see i'll start the video
here you can see
okay the snail is moving but it's taking
a long time
right very slow in the background you
saw the cars going by very quickly
cars move fast be careful snails
move really slow
this snail's very slow okay we don't
have time to watch them
move it would take a long time to see a
move from one side to the other
we don't have time okay so next we have
breathe breathe
okay we have the e at the end that's
important i will
explain uh soon but
to breathe means to
take air into the body actually you take
it into your lungs
right and then you send it out again all
living things breathe now animals and
plants
have different ways to breathe but for
animals right we breathe in the air
the air goes into our lungs we take the
oxygen
out and it goes into our blood and this
gives us
energy we need the oxygen
to live so we breathe in the air we
don't need all of the air
just a little part of it is oxygen but
we take that oxygen
and we breathe out
the breath the air that we don't need or
the the gas that is coming out of our
body
so it's important to think about breathe
in breathe out so we can also say that
you breathe
in and you breathe
out okay breathe in
breathe out breathe in breathe out and
we do it all the time we don't
even think about it because it's a
natural part
of living now i said it's important
the e at the end now there's a very
similar word
it's called it's it's spelled this way
and this is different so be careful
breath
breathe is a verb
it's the action right i showed you
that's to breathe breath
is a noun okay so
be careful don't get those two words
confused we can say
take a breath
that is a breath breathe in and breathe
out
that is one breath okay so when you talk
about a breath
as a noun it's no e and we pronounce it
breath but if you're talking about the
action
that's a verb we put an e on the end and
we pronounce it
breathe okay so breath
breathe be careful don't get them
mixed up okay good okay next
we have a video now fish can breathe
how can fish breathe they're under water
where do they get the air well it's
interesting because
even in water there is gas
water is hydrogen and oxygen and fish
are designed to be able to get
the gas the oxygen that they need
through their gills
right they don't breathe in through
their mouth they have
gills on the side of their bodies
and they are able to take in uh the gas
that they need
now if we can see you know we can see
the little fish moving around it's hard
to see their gills
you can see their mouths moving but
they're not really breathing through
their mouth
they're breathing through their gills
let me write that for you
gills and i put s because
a fish have two gills on either side
right
and they're kind of their neck and they
kind of open up and close
as they're swimming and that's where the
water passes through and they can catch
the air or the oxygen that they need
through their gills so fish obviously
are much
different than mammals because they
breathe differently and they can breathe
under water mammals can't breathe
underwater
whales and dolphins are mammals but they
have to come
up and they have a hole in the back of
their head that opens up
and they take in the air and they
breathe through that hole
so mammals and whales are not really
fish they're
mammals but true fish have gills
okay interesting next we have
oxygen and i said that word before
oxygen
oxygen or oxygen if you say it quickly
sounds like oxygen oxygen oxygen is
very important obviously i just said
when we breathe in
we need the oxygen in the air
the air around us actually
you know we it's kind of maybe a bigger
um
lesson nitrogen and
oxygen the air
right now around me and around you
uh is 21
only 21 oxygen the rest what is that
that's
79 percent nitrogen
right so we don't need nitrogen our
bodies
don't use nitrogen nitrogen is it's like
nothing to our body we don't react to
nitrogen
but we do react with oxygen and we need
oxygen to live oxygen goes into our
blood it helps us
uh do many of the the functions that our
cells
need uh to be able to to do what they
they do and there's so many different
cells that do have different tasks
in our body and that's that helps us to
live so oxygen is a gas
right it's a gas that living things need
we need it fish need it uh many
different living things
need oxygen and
mostly the air is 79 nitrogen
21 oxygen yes there are other gases but
they're very small
they're not really measurable uh in any
situation any typical situation
okay that we you know in the outside
okay good so oxygen
is very important for us and most living
things
next we have healthy healthy means to be
strong and well
i hope you are healthy and your parents
are very interested or
they're very worried hopefully not too
worried that you
stay healthy and you should eat well
eat good things eat vegetables eat
you know depending on you know
meat is good vegetables of course are
very important
make sure you eat a balanced diet so to
stay healthy
but that's not it you also need to
exercise this boy is
exercising because you need to give your
muscles
the practice or the chance to grow
strong
and you want to stay healthy and not
just eating and exercise
you also need sleep so make sure you get
enough sleep
put your phone away don't play video
games too long
get enough sleep at night all of these
things
help you remain healthy and you want to
be healthy
all your life of course when you're
young you're very strong and healthy
as you get older you have to work harder
to be to stay healthy okay
good okay

concert but live okay so be careful live
01:12
live okay in this case live
01:16
live means to be alive next word is to
01:20
grow
01:21
things that live
01:24
grow they grow during their lives
01:27
right they become bigger or taller over
01:31
a period of time
01:32
you are growing right now right
01:36
you can't see it right grow to grow
01:39
usually means
01:40
it takes a long time right it takes many
01:43
months maybe years for you to notice a
01:47
change as you grow but some animals grow
01:50
very quickly
01:51
right like pets dogs and cats they grow
01:55
very quickly you still hard to see you
01:56
don't see it right happening right now

chicken will
02:29
hatch after a while right the egg will
02:32
change
02:32
it'll break open and a little chick will
02:35
come out of it
02:36
that's a big change right to become
02:39
different you also change right when you
02:42
were a baby
02:43
now you were a child or a teenager
02:46
you changed right and you will continue
02:49
to change
02:50
through your life we all do okay
02:54
reproduce reproduce
02:58
reproduce reproduce means to make
03:02
more living things of the same kind
03:06
all living things are able to
03:09
reproduce that means that they can make
03:12
more
03:13
living things that look like them when
03:16
you get older you might get married and
03:18
have
03:18
children that means you will reproduce
03:21
right
03:22
when your dog gets older it can meet
03:24
another dog
03:26
become a parent and they will have
03:28
children right
03:29
plants when they get older they send out
03:32
seeds or pollen and they will reproduce
03:36
and
03:36
more plants will grow so to make more
03:39
living things
03:40
of the same kind that's to reproduce
03:44
next word is a sad word
03:48
die to no longer be alive
03:52
here we have a sad picture of a bird
03:54
probably an old bird who became too
03:56
old and then died all living things
04:00
become old and die it's part of life
04:04
the thing is enjoy your life while
04:06
you're live while you
04:08
while you are living right to enjoy your
04:10
life and be good to other people that's
04:12
the important thing
04:14
okay our next word is move to move
04:18
to move means to go from place a to
04:21
place b
04:22
right something is at place a and it
04:25
moves
04:25
over to place b now here we have a
04:28
picture
04:29
of a snail snails are famous
04:33
for moving very slowly somebody might
04:36
say oh
04:37
you move like a snail means you
04:40
move very slowly
04:43
and probably not a good idea especially
04:46
if you're going to school
04:47
okay so actually we have a video of a
04:50
snail moving
04:51
and you can see i'll start the video
04:53
here you can see
04:55
okay the snail is moving but it's taking
04:59
a long time
05:01
right very slow in the background you
05:03
saw the cars going by very quickly
05:06
cars move fast be careful snails
05:09
move really slow
05:12
this snail's very slow okay we don't
05:14
have time to watch them
05:16
move it would take a long time to see a
05:18
move from one side to the other
05:20
we don't have time okay so next we have
05:24
breathe breathe
05:27
okay we have the e at the end that's
05:29
important i will
05:31
explain uh soon but
05:34
to breathe means to
05:37
take air into the body actually you take
05:40
it into your lungs
05:41
right and then you send it out again all
05:45
living things breathe now animals and
05:48
plants
05:50
have different ways to breathe but for
05:53
animals right we breathe in the air
05:57
the air goes into our lungs we take the
05:59
oxygen
06:00
out and it goes into our blood and this
06:02
gives us
06:03
energy we need the oxygen
06:07
to live so we breathe in the air we
06:10
don't need all of the air
06:11
just a little part of it is oxygen but
06:14
we take that oxygen
06:15
and we breathe out
06:19
the breath the air that we don't need or
06:21
the the gas that is coming out of our
06:23
body
06:24
so it's important to think about breathe
06:27
in breathe out so we can also say that
06:31
you breathe
06:32
in and you breathe
06:35
out okay breathe in
06:38
breathe out breathe in breathe out and
06:41
we do it all the time we don't
06:43
even think about it because it's a
06:45
natural part
06:46
of living now i said it's important
06:50
the e at the end now there's a very
06:52
similar word
06:54
it's called it's it's spelled this way
06:58
and this is different so be careful
07:00
breath
07:02
breathe is a verb
07:05
it's the action right i showed you
07:08
that's to breathe breath
07:12
is a noun okay so
07:16
be careful don't get those two words
07:20
confused we can say
07:23
take a breath
07:27
that is a breath breathe in and breathe
07:29
out
07:30
that is one breath okay so when you talk
07:33
about a breath
07:34
as a noun it's no e and we pronounce it
07:38
breath but if you're talking about the
07:41
action
07:42
that's a verb we put an e on the end and
07:45
we pronounce it
07:46
breathe okay so breath
07:51
breathe be careful don't get them
07:54
mixed up okay good okay next
07:58
we have a video now fish can breathe
08:01
how can fish breathe they're under water
08:06
where do they get the air well it's
08:09
interesting because
08:10
even in water there is gas
08:13
water is hydrogen and oxygen and fish
08:17
are designed to be able to get
08:20
the gas the oxygen that they need
08:23
through their gills
08:24
right they don't breathe in through
08:26
their mouth they have
08:27
gills on the side of their bodies
08:30
and they are able to take in uh the gas
08:34
that they need
08:34
now if we can see you know we can see
08:37
the little fish moving around it's hard
08:38
to see their gills
08:40
you can see their mouths moving but
08:42
they're not really breathing through
08:43
their mouth
08:44
they're breathing through their gills
08:46
let me write that for you
08:48
gills and i put s because
08:52
a fish have two gills on either side
08:56
right
08:56
and they're kind of their neck and they
08:58
kind of open up and close
09:00
as they're swimming and that's where the
09:03
water passes through and they can catch
09:06
the air or the oxygen that they need
09:08
through their gills so fish obviously
09:11
are much
09:11
different than mammals because they
09:14
breathe differently and they can breathe
09:16
under water mammals can't breathe
09:19
underwater
09:20
whales and dolphins are mammals but they
09:23
have to come
09:23
up and they have a hole in the back of
09:25
their head that opens up
09:27
and they take in the air and they
09:29
breathe through that hole
09:30
so mammals and whales are not really
09:33
fish they're
09:34
mammals but true fish have gills
09:37
okay interesting next we have
09:40
oxygen and i said that word before
09:43
oxygen
09:44
oxygen or oxygen if you say it quickly
09:48
sounds like oxygen oxygen oxygen is
09:51
very important obviously i just said
09:54
when we breathe in
09:56
we need the oxygen in the air
09:59
the air around us actually
10:02
you know we it's kind of maybe a bigger
10:05
um
10:06
lesson nitrogen and
10:10
oxygen the air
10:12
right now around me and around you
10:15
uh is 21
10:19
only 21 oxygen the rest what is that
10:22
that's
10:23
79 percent nitrogen
10:27
right so we don't need nitrogen our
10:30
bodies
10:31
don't use nitrogen nitrogen is it's like
10:36
nothing to our body we don't react to
10:38
nitrogen
10:39
but we do react with oxygen and we need
10:43
oxygen to live oxygen goes into our
10:46
blood it helps us
10:47
uh do many of the the functions that our
10:51
cells
10:52
need uh to be able to to do what they
10:56
they do and there's so many different
10:57
cells that do have different tasks
11:00
in our body and that's that helps us to
11:02
live so oxygen is a gas
11:04
right it's a gas that living things need
11:08
we need it fish need it uh many
11:11
different living things
11:12
need oxygen and
11:15
mostly the air is 79 nitrogen
11:19
21 oxygen yes there are other gases but
11:22
they're very small
11:23
they're not really measurable uh in any
11:26
situation any typical situation
11:28
okay that we you know in the outside
11:31
okay good so oxygen
11:32
is very important for us and most living
11:35
things
11:37
next we have healthy healthy means to be
11:40
strong and well
11:41
i hope you are healthy and your parents
11:44
are very interested or
11:46
they're very worried hopefully not too
11:48
worried that you
11:49
stay healthy and you should eat well
11:52
eat good things eat vegetables eat
11:56
you know depending on you know
11:59
meat is good vegetables of course are
12:01
very important
12:02
make sure you eat a balanced diet so to
12:05
stay healthy
12:06
but that's not it you also need to
12:08
exercise this boy is
12:10
exercising because you need to give your
12:13
muscles
12:14
the practice or the chance to grow
12:17
strong
12:18
and you want to stay healthy and not
12:20
just eating and exercise
12:21
you also need sleep so make sure you get
12:24
enough sleep
12:26
put your phone away don't play video
12:28
games too long
12:29
get enough sleep at night all of these
12:32
things
12:33
help you remain healthy and you want to
12:36
be healthy
12:37
all your life of course when you're
12:38
young you're very strong and healthy
12:41
as you get older you have to work harder
12:44
to be to stay healthy okay
12:47
good okay
