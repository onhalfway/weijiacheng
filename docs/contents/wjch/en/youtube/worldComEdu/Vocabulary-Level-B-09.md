hello everybody welcome back to reading
for vocabulary i'm brian stewart
are you ready to get started with lesson
nine lesson 9 is
how much do you weigh be
careful don't ask adults this question
especially women it's not a polite
question
but you can ask your friends who are
younger how much do you
weigh how heavy are you okay
so in this lesson we will focus on
you weigh different amounts
on the other planets oh seems like a bit
of a difficult lesson right
but we'll look at that in the reading so
we need to study vocabulary first
to be able to study the reading okay you
ready
let's begin with the first word the
first whoa what's that that's crazy
isn't it
you see a pig here a pig has wings
can a pig fly no that's crazy
if somebody asks you can
a pig this is a pig
can a pig fly
that's crazy right that's silly not
able to happen no way it
is impossible
impossible impossible
okay that's crazy can a pig fly no way
no way
that's the same meaning it's impossible
it is impossible it's
impossible this is a long word let's
practice the pronunciation
impossible put it together very quickly
impossible impossible okay
so impossible no way it can
never happen okay let's go to the next
word
number two wow these guys are having fun
aren't they
these look like they're astronauts
they're in training
there's they're upside down what's going
on
the force that pulls everything
down to the ground right right now i'm
standing on the ground
maybe you're sitting in your chair
there's a force that's
pulling us towards the ground what
is that force that force is
gravity gravity
gravity in this picture there is no
gravity so people are upside down
they don't weigh anything there's no
force
there's no gravity pulling them
to the ground so it's very interesting
here these this is how
astronauts can train if there's no
gravity
that's the way it is away from the earth
off the earth
in outer space there's no gravity
because the
earth makes that force the earth is so
big
it has gravity okay that's an important
thing to remember for the reading number
three
look at this what is this this is a
feather right this is a feather
but that's not our word i'll just write
what this
is here this is a feather if you
pick up a feather wow it's very easy to
pick up right
you don't have to be strong to pick up a
feather you just pick it up
so it is easy to lift it is
light light now what if we use
light to compare two different things
let's say we have two friends we have
one friend well one friend
okay her name this is anne
her name is ann then we have another
friend
and his name
okay wow this guy is kind of big he
looks like a snowman really
okay he's got big feet here okay he's
got another
leg here and another big foot okay i'm
not a great artist
but his name is joe now if we look at
our friends
we can say that ann ann is light
joe is not light so let's compare them
we can say an is lighter
than joe lighter l-i-h-g-h-t-e-r
we add e-r to the adjective
to compare them we say an
is lighter than
joe and that's how we compare
the two people using the word and is
lighter than joe okay
so many adjectives you can use to
compare
two different things and we'll see that
in the reading
okay number four okay sorry about the
picture
it looks like joe's sister right okay
so hard to lift what's the opposite of
light
pandero light is heavy
heavy so just as we did before with
light we said
an is lighter than joe we could also say
joe is heavier
heavier now heavy right
have oops sorry what am i doing
h-a-h-e-a-v
but we have a y here we have a y so how
do we change that
we have to change the y to an i and then
add our e-r i'm sorry that's kind of
it's kind of messy let me
write it so it's a little bit clearer
for you
h-e-a-v change the y to an
i and then add e-r so
joe is heavier than an and this would be
the comparison
for heavy okay so light lighter
heavy heavier okay we need to know that
for the reading
okay next word okay what's going on here
to have a weight if if something has a
weight
and you want to know what is that weight
this person weighs a hundred kilograms
what is this person
doing they stand on a scale
this is a scale and what do they do
they weigh themselves this is a verb
to weigh if you weigh yourself
you want to know what is your weight you
have a weight
you want to know what is my weight or
how much do i weigh how
much do
i weigh
how much do i weigh stand on a scale
the scale will tell you how much
you weigh okay so to have a weight
to weigh something okay the next word
wow this is a really cool picture isn't
it
do you know what planet this is this is
a planet in our solar system
it's the largest okay the largest
that's superlative right planet in the
solar system
the most the largest planet in our solar
system
is of course jupiter jupiter
jupiter it's the largest planet
in the solar system it is larger
than any other planet larger
than any other planet it is the largest
and its name is jupiter jupiter
okay next one whoa are you hungry
this looks delicious right i hope you're
not hungry okay
twice the amount so let's say a
hamburger
is usually only this big right
maybe it's only this big but you make
it twice the amount two times two
times the amount some people just do
this
two times two times the amount
of course twice the amount you say it's
double right
sometimes if you go into a hamburger
fast
food restaurant you can say can i have a
double
hamburger right it looks like this
because this is a single hamburger
and then we add uh the same on top and
that makes it a
double hamburger a double so you
you know you could do many things that
could be double right
double meat on your sandwich right
double
cheese put two times the normal
amount on your sandwich or whatever it
is
and then it's double it is twice
the amount also to write twice
twice it's twice the amount it is
double times two okay next word
whoa what's going on here wow she looks
very happy
why look at her jeans her jeans are very
wide here but her jeans are a little
skinnier right
they're skinny here they're not so wide
they're slim
slim or
we could say skinny skinny
now slim is a better word
than skinny skinny seems oh picori
right it's too thin right skinny
is not always very polite okay slim
is a better word more polite in this
situation
but what did she do how did she become
slim how did she become slim
she had a plan to eat healthy food
she planned to eat healthy food and she
followed her plan
that was a diet so diet
can be a noun or a verb right
for example i am
on a diet
right i am on a diet that's a noun
that means i am careful about what i
eat right i'm being careful about what
i'm eating
because i want to lose weight right also
you can use it as a verb i
will diet
i will diet so that's a verb you could
use it as a noun
you can use it as a verb it means to
plan your meals to eat carefully maybe
you want to lose weight
or maybe you want to be healthier
no junk food okay okay next one
now uh to not be able to find something
this is a very common item that people
forget where are they right od
right where did they go to not be able
to find
something means that you lost it or you
lose
something right you lose it where are
your keys i don't know
did you lose your keys sometimes you
might
lose your cell phone then you ask your
friend can you call me
and then you oh i hear it where's my
cell phone then you find it right
but you lose if you lose these things
you have to find them so lose be careful
because
it's irregular verb right i said lost
just a few seconds ago it's lose
lost lost okay so past tense i
lost my keys i lost my
cell phone have you lost your books
right okay so lose lost lost
next word wow she's having fun right
she's jumping in the air that's the word
to use your legs to go into the air
to jump up off the ground
how high can you jump that's a good
question
you can practice with your friends how
high can you
jump okay how
high can you jump after this lesson if
you have some play time
go out with your friends see how high
you can jump
you can have a contest but be careful
okay okay next word
11. they're having fun too right
what are they doing to hold something
and move it toward yourself
so you hold something and you move it
towards yourself
like these people are doing they've got
that rope and they're
what are they doing they are pulling
to pull to pull is to hold it and move
it towards yourself
to pull something now you might ask well
what's the opposite
right sometimes you have something near
you you want it away from you so you go
like this
the opposite of pull is push
so these two words are kind of used
very commonly right to push to pull
push pull okay these are pandero
opposites okay 12.
whoa they're really having a lot of fun
right this is a roller
coaster oh it's a long word isn't it
roller coaster
roller coaster kind of scary have you
ever been
on a roller coaster first you go up and
then from a higher place
you go to a lower place you go up and
then you go
down right you go up then you go down
these people are going down very fast
it's very scary right so go up then you
go down
to go from a higher place to a lower
place to go down
13. this person has
a job that is not easy his job is not
easy
so we say it is hard
he has a hard job another word for hard
the same meaning is difficult
right right difficult
hard it's hard it's difficult
right it's very difficult it's very hard
it's not easy okay number 14
kind of an interesting picture we have
many uh little balls
they're all sad but one ball is happy
right
he's not the same as something else
not the same as the other things in the
group
something that is what that is different
different different
different okay this person or this
little ball not a person
this little ball is different from the
other balls right
so you see one thing that looks
different from many other things
it's unique it's different okay
number 15. i feel sorry for this guy
right of course they're just playing to
take something from
one place to another so if you pick
something up and you move it from one
place
to another place what are you doing it
is to carry
you are carrying the boxes you are
carrying your books what do you
carry every day you probably carry your
backpack
right from your home to your school and
then back again
in your backpack you carry books maybe
your lunch
pens pencils lots of things you carry
many things in your backpack
you carry many things in your pockets
okay to carry our last word here
these guys look like they're very happy
with each other they look very uh
like they are what right someone you
like very much
someone that you like very much what do
you call that person
you call that person a friend that
person is my friend
i like him or her very much
he or she is my friend okay we've
studied the words now it's time to look
at the exercises
to review the vocabulary we just learned
let's take a look here here are our
words there are eight words
we need to look at the object of the
exercise is
complete each sentence so we have
sentences here
we need to fill in the blanks with these
words
our words are let's go over them
together
impossible impossible
next one jupiter jupiter
okay next one way
way next one diet
diet the next one
gravity gravity
next one is heavier
heavier notice heavier right
is in the comparison you're saying it's
heavier
somewhere else right it's heavier not
heavy
but heavier so we need to pay attention
to the sentence in which this is used
next one double double
and the last one lighter
lighter notice also that lighter
is in the comparative form not light
but lighter so we have to be careful
about these two words they're very
similar
we have to pay attention to what the
sentence is
saying let's begin with number one
we weigh less on the moon
so of course the earth has a moon right
if we were there
we would weigh less we are beep
there so if we weigh less on
earth we weigh this much but on the moon
we weigh less what does that mean
it means that we are what heavier or
lighter on the moon it means
we are lighter on the moon right
we weigh maybe 100 kilograms on the
earth
maybe we weigh i don't know let's just
say
60 kilograms on the moon we weigh
less there there means on the moon
okay so we where we are lighter on the
moon
okay number two i'm too heavy
i need to go on a so if somebody's too
heavy they're a little
right
they are what they want to they want to
go on something remember the word i
taught you
you can use it as a noun or a verb right
if you want to lose weight you want to
change your the what you eat
you go on a
diet you go on a diet
that's the proper expression to use with
diet
go on a diet right don't say
i am diet no don't say that that's
konglish that's
incorrect say i am going to go
on a diet or i am on a diet
okay on a diet okay three
how heavy is it so you want to know how
heavy is it or
remember what i taught you before how
much
does it
weigh right whoops how much does it
weigh
how heavy is it is the same same
question
how much does it weigh so if you want to
know
how heavy something is or how
light something is you want to know how
much it weighs
so what do you do of course you say
let's weigh it
you could use the same word how much
does it weigh
let's weigh it how heavy is it
let's weigh it how light is it
let's weigh it all those three questions
mean the same thing
okay number four we weigh
more on the sun if we were on the sun of
course we would die
it's too hot right we'd disappear but
just
imagine if we could be on the sun the
sun's really big
so it has really a lot more gravity
much more force pulling you to the sun
we weigh more in the sun we are what
there
okay this is like the other question
number one we weigh
less on the moon right so we are lighter
there
in this case we weigh more on the sun
so we are what of course we are heavier
there there again refers to on the sun
right so we are heavier on the sun
than we are on earth because we weigh
more there okay number five
the biggest planet is remember when we
studied this word it said the
largest planet but largest biggest
they mean the same thing largest biggest
same thing
so the largest the biggest
the largest planet the biggest planet
same meaning
is what well of course there's only one
planet here
and that planet is jupiter jupiter
six beep is what pulls us down
i talked about that before when i was
talking about the sun
the sun is huge it has a lot more
what it's the force that pulls us down
to the ground right oh there's too much
gravity okay i'm back okay
we're not on the sun we're on earth okay
so gravity
is what pulls us down right it's gravity
okay number seven
okay like i said before people can't
live on the sun
why not because it's what
like i said before if we were on the sun
we'd burn up right
we can't live on the sun it is
impossible
no way can we live on the sun it's too
hot
right okay eight we weigh
beep on jupiter so we weigh
what on jupiter now this is hard to know
because we didn't really cover that
in the vocabulary section right but this
is in the reading
but basically think about this jupiter
is a very big planet right it's huge
okay and uh we weigh more on jupiter
in fact we weigh double on jupiter
if you looked at you know more actually
it's more than double we weigh
more than and we'll find that out
in the reading we weigh more than double
more than
two times why because as we said before
jupiter is the biggest planet in our
solar system
it has a lot more gravity so we would
weigh more than double
on jupiter okay so those are the words
that's the vocabulary section
let's take a break now we'll come back
and we'll look at the reading as you can
see the reading is going to be very
interesting okay so don't go away come
back in a few
seconds or minutes

00:07
hello everybody welcome back to reading
00:09
for vocabulary i'm brian stewart
00:12
are you ready to get started with lesson
00:14
nine lesson 9 is
00:16
how much do you weigh be
00:19
careful don't ask adults this question
00:23
especially women it's not a polite
00:25
question
00:26
but you can ask your friends who are
00:28
younger how much do you
00:30
weigh how heavy are you okay
00:33
so in this lesson we will focus on
00:36
you weigh different amounts
00:40
on the other planets oh seems like a bit
00:44
of a difficult lesson right
00:46
but we'll look at that in the reading so
00:49
we need to study vocabulary first
00:51
to be able to study the reading okay you
00:54
ready
00:55
let's begin with the first word the
00:57
first whoa what's that that's crazy
00:59
isn't it
01:00
you see a pig here a pig has wings
01:04
can a pig fly no that's crazy
01:07
if somebody asks you can
01:10
a pig this is a pig
01:14
can a pig fly
01:18
that's crazy right that's silly not
01:21
able to happen no way it
01:25
is impossible
01:29
impossible impossible
01:32
okay that's crazy can a pig fly no way
01:37
no way
01:40
that's the same meaning it's impossible
01:44
it is impossible it's
01:47
impossible this is a long word let's
01:50
practice the pronunciation
01:52
impossible put it together very quickly
01:55
impossible impossible okay
01:59
so impossible no way it can
02:02
never happen okay let's go to the next
02:05
word
02:06
number two wow these guys are having fun
02:09
aren't they
02:10
these look like they're astronauts
02:12
they're in training
02:13
there's they're upside down what's going
02:16
on
02:18
the force that pulls everything
02:21
down to the ground right right now i'm
02:24
standing on the ground
02:25
maybe you're sitting in your chair
02:28
there's a force that's
02:29
pulling us towards the ground what
02:32
is that force that force is
02:36
gravity gravity
02:40
gravity in this picture there is no
02:43
gravity so people are upside down
02:46
they don't weigh anything there's no
02:49
force
02:50
there's no gravity pulling them
02:53
to the ground so it's very interesting
02:56
here these this is how
02:57
astronauts can train if there's no
03:00
gravity
03:01
that's the way it is away from the earth
03:04
off the earth
03:04
in outer space there's no gravity
03:07
because the
03:08
earth makes that force the earth is so
03:11
big
03:11
it has gravity okay that's an important
03:15
thing to remember for the reading number
03:18
three
03:19
look at this what is this this is a
03:21
feather right this is a feather
03:23
but that's not our word i'll just write
03:26
what this
03:26
is here this is a feather if you
03:29
pick up a feather wow it's very easy to
03:32
pick up right
03:33
you don't have to be strong to pick up a
03:35
feather you just pick it up
03:37
so it is easy to lift it is
03:40
light light now what if we use
03:44
light to compare two different things
03:47
let's say we have two friends we have
03:50
one friend well one friend
03:54
okay her name this is anne
03:57
her name is ann then we have another
04:00
friend
04:01
and his name
04:04
okay wow this guy is kind of big he
04:07
looks like a snowman really
04:09
okay he's got big feet here okay he's
04:12
got another
04:12
leg here and another big foot okay i'm
04:15
not a great artist
04:16
but his name is joe now if we look at
04:19
our friends
04:20
we can say that ann ann is light
04:24
joe is not light so let's compare them
04:27
we can say an is lighter
04:31
than joe lighter l-i-h-g-h-t-e-r
04:36
we add e-r to the adjective
04:40
to compare them we say an
04:44
is lighter than
04:49
joe and that's how we compare
04:52
the two people using the word and is
04:55
lighter than joe okay
04:59
so many adjectives you can use to
05:01
compare
05:02
two different things and we'll see that
05:05
in the reading
05:06
okay number four okay sorry about the
05:09
picture
05:10
it looks like joe's sister right okay
05:14
so hard to lift what's the opposite of
05:17
light
05:17
pandero light is heavy
05:21
heavy so just as we did before with
05:24
light we said
05:25
an is lighter than joe we could also say
05:29
joe is heavier
05:32
heavier now heavy right
05:35
have oops sorry what am i doing
05:39
h-a-h-e-a-v
05:41
but we have a y here we have a y so how
05:44
do we change that
05:45
we have to change the y to an i and then
05:48
add our e-r i'm sorry that's kind of
05:50
it's kind of messy let me
05:52
write it so it's a little bit clearer
05:55
for you
05:56
h-e-a-v change the y to an
05:59
i and then add e-r so
06:02
joe is heavier than an and this would be
06:06
the comparison
06:07
for heavy okay so light lighter
06:11
heavy heavier okay we need to know that
06:13
for the reading
06:14
okay next word okay what's going on here
06:18
to have a weight if if something has a
06:21
weight
06:22
and you want to know what is that weight
06:26
this person weighs a hundred kilograms
06:28
what is this person
06:30
doing they stand on a scale
06:33
this is a scale and what do they do
06:37
they weigh themselves this is a verb
06:40
to weigh if you weigh yourself
06:45
you want to know what is your weight you
06:47
have a weight
06:48
you want to know what is my weight or
06:52
how much do i weigh how
06:56
much do
07:00
i weigh
07:05
how much do i weigh stand on a scale
07:08
the scale will tell you how much
07:12
you weigh okay so to have a weight
07:15
to weigh something okay the next word
07:18
wow this is a really cool picture isn't
07:20
it
07:21
do you know what planet this is this is
07:23
a planet in our solar system
07:25
it's the largest okay the largest
07:29
that's superlative right planet in the
07:32
solar system
07:33
the most the largest planet in our solar
07:36
system
07:37
is of course jupiter jupiter
07:41
jupiter it's the largest planet
07:44
in the solar system it is larger
07:48
than any other planet larger
07:52
than any other planet it is the largest
07:55
and its name is jupiter jupiter
07:59
okay next one whoa are you hungry
08:02
this looks delicious right i hope you're
08:04
not hungry okay
08:06
twice the amount so let's say a
08:09
hamburger
08:10
is usually only this big right
08:13
maybe it's only this big but you make
08:16
it twice the amount two times two
08:20
times the amount some people just do
08:23
this
08:23
two times two times the amount
08:27
of course twice the amount you say it's
08:29
double right
08:30
sometimes if you go into a hamburger
08:33
fast
08:34
food restaurant you can say can i have a
08:36
double
08:37
hamburger right it looks like this
08:39
because this is a single hamburger
08:42
and then we add uh the same on top and
08:44
that makes it a
08:46
double hamburger a double so you
08:49
you know you could do many things that
08:51
could be double right
08:53
double meat on your sandwich right
08:55
double
08:56
cheese put two times the normal
08:59
amount on your sandwich or whatever it
09:02
is
09:03
and then it's double it is twice
09:06

16:49
studied the words now it's time to look
16:51
at the exercises
16:53
to review the vocabulary we just learned
16:56
let's take a look here here are our
16:58
words there are eight words
17:00
we need to look at the object of the
17:03
exercise is
17:04
complete each sentence so we have
17:06
sentences here
17:08
we need to fill in the blanks with these
17:10
words
17:12
our words are let's go over them
17:14
together
17:15
impossible impossible
17:19
next one jupiter jupiter
17:23
okay next one way
17:26
way next one diet
17:30
diet the next one
17:34
gravity gravity
17:37
next one is heavier
17:40
heavier notice heavier right
17:43
is in the comparison you're saying it's
17:47
heavier
17:48
somewhere else right it's heavier not
17:51
heavy
17:52
but heavier so we need to pay attention
17:55
to the sentence in which this is used
17:59
next one double double
18:02
and the last one lighter
18:06
lighter notice also that lighter
18:09
is in the comparative form not light
18:12
but lighter so we have to be careful
18:16
about these two words they're very
18:17
similar
18:18
we have to pay attention to what the
18:21
sentence is
18:22
saying let's begin with number one
18:25
we weigh less on the moon
18:28
so of course the earth has a moon right
18:30
if we were there
18:32
we would weigh less we are beep
18:35
there so if we weigh less on
18:38
earth we weigh this much but on the moon
18:42
we weigh less what does that mean
18:45
it means that we are what heavier or
18:48
lighter on the moon it means
18:51
we are lighter on the moon right
18:54
we weigh maybe 100 kilograms on the
18:58
earth
18:58
maybe we weigh i don't know let's just
19:01
say
19:01
60 kilograms on the moon we weigh
19:05
less there there means on the moon
19:09
okay so we where we are lighter on the
19:12
moon
19:13
okay number two i'm too heavy
19:17
i need to go on a so if somebody's too
19:20
heavy they're a little
19:22
right
19:26
they are what they want to they want to
19:29
go on something remember the word i
19:31
taught you
19:31
you can use it as a noun or a verb right
19:34
if you want to lose weight you want to
19:37
change your the what you eat
19:39
you go on a
19:42
diet you go on a diet
19:45
that's the proper expression to use with
19:48
diet
19:49
go on a diet right don't say
19:53
i am diet no don't say that that's
19:55
konglish that's
19:56
incorrect say i am going to go
20:00
on a diet or i am on a diet
20:03
okay on a diet okay three
20:07
how heavy is it so you want to know how
20:10
heavy is it or
20:11
remember what i taught you before how
20:14
much
20:16
does it
20:20
weigh right whoops how much does it
20:24
weigh
20:25
how heavy is it is the same same
20:27
question
20:28
how much does it weigh so if you want to
20:31
know
20:32
how heavy something is or how
20:35
light something is you want to know how
20:38
much it weighs
20:39
so what do you do of course you say
20:41
let's weigh it
20:42
you could use the same word how much
20:44
does it weigh
20:45
let's weigh it how heavy is it
20:48
let's weigh it how light is it
20:52
let's weigh it all those three questions
20:54
mean the same thing
20:56
okay number four we weigh
21:00
more on the sun if we were on the sun of
21:03
course we would die
21:05
it's too hot right we'd disappear but
21:07
just
21:08
imagine if we could be on the sun the
21:10
sun's really big
21:12
so it has really a lot more gravity
21:16
much more force pulling you to the sun
21:19
we weigh more in the sun we are what
21:22
there
21:22
okay this is like the other question
21:24
number one we weigh
21:26
less on the moon right so we are lighter
21:29
there
21:30
in this case we weigh more on the sun
21:33
so we are what of course we are heavier
21:36
there there again refers to on the sun
21:40
right so we are heavier on the sun
21:43
than we are on earth because we weigh
21:46
more there okay number five
21:50
the biggest planet is remember when we
21:53
studied this word it said the
21:55
largest planet but largest biggest
21:58
they mean the same thing largest biggest
22:01
same thing
22:02
so the largest the biggest
22:05
the largest planet the biggest planet
22:08
same meaning
22:09
is what well of course there's only one
22:12
planet here
22:12
and that planet is jupiter jupiter
22:17
six beep is what pulls us down
22:20
i talked about that before when i was
22:22
talking about the sun
22:23
the sun is huge it has a lot more
22:27
what it's the force that pulls us down
22:30
to the ground right oh there's too much
22:32
gravity okay i'm back okay
22:34
we're not on the sun we're on earth okay
22:36
so gravity
22:38
is what pulls us down right it's gravity
22:41
okay number seven
22:45
okay like i said before people can't
22:47
live on the sun
22:49
why not because it's what
22:52
like i said before if we were on the sun
22:54
we'd burn up right
22:57
we can't live on the sun it is
23:00
impossible
23:01
no way can we live on the sun it's too
23:04
hot
23:05
right okay eight we weigh
23:08
beep on jupiter so we weigh
23:11
what on jupiter now this is hard to know
23:14
because we didn't really cover that
23:16
in the vocabulary section right but this
23:18
is in the reading
23:19
but basically think about this jupiter
23:23
is a very big planet right it's huge
23:26
okay and uh we weigh more on jupiter
23:30
in fact we weigh double on jupiter
23:34
if you looked at you know more actually
23:36
it's more than double we weigh
23:38
more than and we'll find that out
23:42
in the reading we weigh more than double
23:45
more than
23:45
two times why because as we said before
23:48
jupiter is the biggest planet in our
23:52
solar system
23:52
it has a lot more gravity so we would
23:55
weigh more than double
23:56
on jupiter okay so those are the words
23:59
that's the vocabulary section
24:01
let's take a break now we'll come back
24:03
and we'll look at the reading as you can
24:05
see the reading is going to be very
24:06
interesting okay so don't go away come
24:09
back in a few
24:10
seconds or minutes
