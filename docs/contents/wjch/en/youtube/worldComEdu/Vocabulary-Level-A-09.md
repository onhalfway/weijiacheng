our wordless number one a warm and rainy
season so it's a warm season a lot of
rain comes down and as we can see
there's lots of insects come out flowers
bloom what season is it we say it is
spring spring okay so in spring life
comes out it's and it also rains a lot
okay next one is a hot season kids go
swimming they enjoy swimming it's very
hot so you can wear a bathing suit no
problem we talked about that what season
is it it is summer summer is a hot
season okay next one we talked about
this a dry and cool season it's dry
doesn't rain a lot leaves fall from the
trees it's cool so you have to wear more
clothes this of course is fall you can
also say autumn but a simpler word is
fall it's easier to say fall in the fall
okay next one we talked about this one a
cold season there are snow flakes
falling out we can make snowmen so
there's a lot of snow it's a cold season
what season is it of course
it's winter winter it is cold in winter
let's learn some more words about
seasons let's take a look at this this
is an interesting picture here when we
talk about the seasons remember I said
there are four seasons and this picture
shows all four seasons usually we start
with spring spring summer fall winter
and then it starts again it's like a
circle right we start with spring
because that's when life comes back out
in the winter everything see
dead but in the spring it comes back out
and the time of the year with special
weather there are four of them and I use
that word already of course we're
talking about season there are four
seasons spring summer fall and winter
they are all called seasons and there
are 4 of them ok let's take a look at
this word here we have a lots and lots
of vegetables here clean and new is our
definition what word are we looking for
of course we're looking for fresh
because especially when you think about
food you want your food to be fresh so
tomatoes are bright red they're round
and they're strong right if they're not
fresh they're old and they don't taste
so good right look but you want fresh
food right so clean it's clean and it's
new not old it is fresh let's take a
look at another word look at this here
are two birds right here is a small bird
and here is a what not small of course
we're looking for big here's a big bird
right big bird ok so sometimes you can
see very big birds sometimes they're
small birds but of course there are many
things that are big many things that are
small something that is not small the
opposite pandeiro is big not small panda
no small big ok
very warm if something is very warm
remember when I talked about summer I
said it is what it is hot it is hot in
summer so very warm warm is kind of a
little warm but hot is very warm right
so you go from cold let's let's do a
little chart here cold is really cool
right freezing lots of snow but next is
cool right cool is not as strong as cold
it's a little warmer
and then after cool we come to warm ok
so warm not cool anymore
and then after warm a little stronger is
hots so we can have a little chart here
cold cool warm hot and of course they go
in degrees ok
so hot is very warm now we have to move
through the air like a bird
can you move through the air like a bird
I'm sorry you can't unless your big
brother or sister throws you right then
you do what you fly but your big brother
or sister shouldn't throw you unless
you're going to land in a swimming pool
ok
flying can be dangerous because landing
well flying isn't dangerous landing is
dangerous right ok so to move through
the air like a bird means to fly and
that's very interesting
ok so fly but fly is a special verb in
English it changes form depending on how
you use it especially in the past tense
what are the three changes we say fly
flew flown so remember fly flew flown
fly flew flown those are the three
different verb tenses for the verb fly
ok now we haven't a word here for water
to fall from clouds so in some times
right you go outside and you feel wet
what's going on there's water falling
from the sky from the clouds in the sky
it falls down what do we say it's doing
we say it is raining now rain can be a
noun right it is rain so we say it is
rain we can say there is a lot of rain
or there's just a little rain that's a
noun we can also use it as a verb
it is well it is raining it is raining
today or it will rain tomorrow it rained
yesterday so noun or verb with rain it
is rain a lot of rain a little rain now
verb it is raining it will rain
it rained this morning okay moving on
being alive a short time okay so we have
actually it's kind of like a contrast
here here we have an old man right he's
been alive for a long time then we have
a boy here right and the word we want is
the word to put next to the boy because
the boy has been alive only a short time
so what do we say about the boy if the
old man is old we say the boy is young
right so that would be the opposite of
old young and old opposites okay to get
ready
looks like this woman she wants to make
a meal right she has a lot of food she's
going to get ready what is she going to
do she's going to prepare prepare a meal
probably your mother or maybe your
father prepares a meal every day
sometimes prepares three meals a day but
at least it's prepared once a day that's
dinner right dinner is prepared every
day to get ready but prepare isn't just
food you prepare to prepares like June B
ha-ah right June Bajada I think so when
you get ready for school
you prepare you put your books in your
bag you put on your school clothes
you're preparing to go to school so when
we get ready for something we are
preparing we prepare for something we
prepare for dinner or you can prepare
something you prepare dinner you
prepare your bag you prepare your notes
okay

02:38

02:41
definition what word are we looking for
02:43
of course we're looking for fresh
02:46
because especially when you think about
02:49
food you want your food to be fresh so
02:54
tomatoes are bright red they're round
02:58

03:16
look at another word look at this here
03:18
are two birds right here is a small bird
03:22
and here is a what not small of course
03:25
we're looking for big here's a big bird
03:28
right big bird ok so sometimes you can
03:31
see very big birds sometimes they're
03:33

03:41
opposite pandeiro is big not small panda
03:45
no small big ok
03:48
very warm if something is very warm
03:51
remember when I talked about summer I
03:54
said it is what it is hot it is hot in
03:59
summer so very warm warm is kind of a
04:03
little warm but hot is very warm right
04:08
so you go from cold let's let's do a
04:11
little chart here cold is really cool
04:15
right freezing lots of snow but next is
04:18
cool right cool is not as strong as cold
04:23
it's a little warmer
04:25
and then after cool we come to warm ok
04:30
so warm not cool anymore
04:32
and then after warm a little stronger is
04:36
hots so we can have a little chart here
04:39
cold cool warm hot and of course they go
04:44
in degrees ok
04:46
so hot is very warm now we have to move
04:51
through the air like a bird
04:53
can you move through the air like a bird
04:55
I'm sorry you can't unless your big
04:59
brother or sister throws you right then
05:02
you do what you fly but your big brother
05:06
or sister shouldn't throw you unless
05:08
you're going to land in a swimming pool
05:10
ok
05:11
flying can be dangerous because landing
05:14
well flying isn't dangerous landing is
05:17
dangerous right ok so to move through
05:20
the air like a bird means to fly and
05:23
that's very interesting
05:24
ok so fly but fly is a special verb in
05:30
English it changes form depending on how
05:34
you use it especially in the past tense
05:36
what are the three changes we say fly
05:40
flew flown so remember fly flew flown
05:45
fly flew flown those are the three
05:49
different verb tenses for the verb fly
05:52
ok now we haven't a word here for water
05:57
to fall from clouds so in some times
06:02
right you go outside and you feel wet
06:05
what's going on there's water falling
06:08
from the sky from the clouds in the sky
06:10
it falls down what do we say it's doing
06:14
we say it is raining now rain can be a
06:18
noun right it is rain so we say it is
06:25
rain we can say there is a lot of rain
06:31
or there's just a little rain that's a
06:34
noun we can also use it as a verb
06:38
it is well it is raining it is raining
06:46
today or it will rain tomorrow it rained
06:52
yesterday so noun or verb with rain it
06:57
is rain a lot of rain a little rain now
07:01
verb it is raining it will rain
07:04
it rained this morning okay moving on
07:09
being alive a short time okay so we have
07:15
actually it's kind of like a contrast
07:17
here here we have an old man right he's
07:20
been alive for a long time then we have
07:24
a boy here right and the word we want is
07:27
the word to put next to the boy because
07:29
the boy has been alive only a short time
07:33
so what do we say about the boy if the
07:36
old man is old we say the boy is young
07:39
right so that would be the opposite of
07:42
old young and old opposites okay to get
07:48
ready
07:49
looks like this woman she wants to make
07:52
a meal right she has a lot of food she's
07:55
going to get ready what is she going to
07:57
do she's going to prepare prepare a meal
08:02

08:04
father prepares a meal every day
08:08
sometimes prepares three meals a day but
08:11
at least it's prepared once a day that's
08:14
dinner right dinner is prepared every
08:16
day to get ready but prepare isn't just
08:20
