hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading my name is brian
stewart
and in this lesson we're looking at
science book 4
lesson 12 forces
in this unit or in this lesson you will
discover
two types of force and what effect
friction has on moving objects
what is friction well let's find out
okay in the vocabulary section our first
word is
pull now this is a force that you can
make
pull means to move something towards you
so in this case the horse
is pulling the cart or the buggy
because the horse is pulling it towards
it
if you take something and you make it
move
towards you you are pulling it like a
door
right a door will say push
or pull when you go to a
business right you go to a coffee shop
and you open the door look at the door
it says
push or pull if it says pull pull the
door towards you
okay we'll talk about push in a second
if it says push push it away from you
okay so those are our opposite words
push and pull so if you pull the door
you pull it towards you if you push it
you move something
away from you see now in this situation
this girl is pushing the
cart or the wheelbarrow away from her so
she's pushing it
the horse is pulling the girl is pushing
okay so these are opposite forces
okay pull and push
next we have bounce that's a fun word
isn't it
you can bounce a ball right it means to
move
up or away from a surface after hitting
it
so if you bounce a ball you throw the
ball on the ground
it hits the ground and bounces back up
if you go to some places some fun places
you can bounce yourself right you can
jump onto like a big
air uh container or tube and
you will compress it and you'll bounce
your whole body will bounce back
up that's fun isn't it right it's a
bouncing room right
so to bounce means to move up or away
from a surface
after hitting it and of course we like
to play with balls right
we throw a ball against a wall it
bounces back and we catch it
okay so you can play tennis by yourself
if you want to right
against a wall or you can play table
tennis also
but of course many people all like to
play uh
just with a ball bouncing it to each
other or just bouncing it by yourself
and of course basketball is a sport
where they really bounce the ball a lot
so that's bounce okay
gravity now gravity is a force
right it's a very strong force and it
pulls
everything towards the ground
a few lessons ago we talked about the
planets
that go around the sun every very
every object has some force some
attraction
uh that that attracts other objects to
it
the bigger the object the stronger the
force so imagine the sun is
very very huge it's very big so it has a
lot of gravity
and that's what keeps those planets of
course the planets have gravity too
and that's what keeps them going around
each other instead of just
flying off into space thankfully the
earth has gravity
we are all being pulled
to the center of the earth but not too
strong our muscles are strong enough
so we can move around but it's
thankfully strong enough it keeps us on
the ground so we don't go flying away
that's not good either okay
so gravity we're used to the earth's
gravity
it keeps us on the ground keeps every
object on the ground
next we have friction friction is
another type of force it's a force
between
two objects moving over each other
now here i have to be careful and say
moving over each other
in english you know if you have an
object here
right and the ground is here and this
object is moving
yes the object is moving over the ground
but this if the object is touching the
ground
and also moving but it's touching it's
also
over the ground so in this case i'm not
talking about this situation
i'm talking about this situation when
two objects
move over when one object moves over
another object but they are touching not
here
they are touching then you have friction
here there's no friction
right but here yes you have friction
so they have to be touching not just
over each other but
also touching like the golf ball right
the golf ball over the grass
the golf ball as it's moving it has
friction it's slowing down
because it's actually touching the grass
okay surface the surface is the top
part of something the picture here shows
the surface
of the ocean right we can't see
underneath the surface of the ocean
we only see the surface it's the top
part of something
my skin we only see the surface of the
skin thankfully we don't see
what's underneath right so we just see
the surface
of the skin okay so those are so those
are our words
in the vocabulary section some of them
are kind of interesting maybe a little
difficult
let's explore them more in more detail
in the two ideas and the reading section
now the first idea the first main idea
of this lesson we're going to talk about
two of the vocabulary words in more
detail we have gravity
and we have friction these are the two
types of forces
that we're going to look at in this
lesson so as i explained before gravity
is a force that pulls everything to the
earth's center because the earth is very
large
it has a strong gravity a
strong force of gravity so gravity is a
force
that pulls down things towards the earth
the amount of force the amount how much
force right the amount of force how much
force
that pulls something down toward the
earth is called its
weight so weight
refers to how much does something weigh
how heavy is an object
of course if you have a very heavy
object you have a piece of metal
let's say gold gold is very heavy you
drop it
it falls very quickly it has a strong
force
that is pulling it towards the center of
the earth that's how much
it weighs but if you take a feather
right a feather how much does a feather
weigh
a feather weighs almost nothing and you
drop it it just slowly goes down to the
earth right
of course we're talking about friction
with the air but that's another another
idea if something is very heavy
it has a stronger force pulling it
towards the earth if something is very
light
it falls not so with not as much
force right okay if you drop a heavy
object on your foot
that's going to hurt if you drop a light
object on your foot
it's just going to bounce off right so
how much something weighs
how heavy is it determines the force
that it falls towards the earth how
strong that force is
that it falls towards the earth and
that's what gravity is
well that's a that a feature of gravity
is not what gravity is
but it's a feature of gravity it's the
amount of force that pulls something
down
towards the earth okay now next we have
friction
now friction is another force right and
it makes an
object slow down when it moves
over another object and when it moves
over another object
of course it's touching consider this
boy he's on what we call
rollerblades i don't know if you
remember rollerblades they were very
popular
a long time ago and of course maybe
nowadays too
but rollerblades as this boy is skating
or rollerblading
on the ground of course he's touching
the ground the wheels are touching
the surface of you know where he's
rollerblading
if he's rollerblading on a smooth
surface
and he pushes off he's going to go
farther right he's going to he's going
to travel
a longer distance but if he's going over
a rough surface like there's a lot of
you know
ups and downs like it's a it's not very
even it's not very smooth it's
it's rough it's bumpy then of course
he's not going to travel as far because
there's more friction
friction is a force that makes an object
slow down
when it moves over another object think
about
ice right if you like ice skates another
example
ice when water freezes the surface
of the ice is very smooth right
it's very slippery too so you can
there's not a lot of friction
when you push off on ice skates you
don't have to push in just push off once
and you go a long ways now think about
if you're on rollerblades and you're on
uh
like a bumpy uh surface you know maybe
the
the people who made the road they didn't
do a good job it's not very cert
it's not very flat it's got little bumps
a little stone sticking up out of the
tar
that's a bumpy road right if you push
off you're not going to go very far
because it's a rough surface so if it's
smooth
you will there's not as much friction if
it's bumpy
there's more friction and of course when
two objects meet each other
they have friction between them so if
you want to eliminate something you want
to go faster
make a smooth surface but if you want to
slow things down
make a bumpy surface that's part of the
reason
why the roads near your house might have
a bump
of course the other reason is that the
driver doesn't want to go boom like this
when he drives his car so of course he
slows down
but anyway that's a different idea
anyway that's friction
okay so we have two forces gravity and
friction gravity is a force
pulling things to the earth friction is
the force that slows objects down
as they move on top of another surface
okay now the next idea is what effect
friction has on moving objects i already
talked about this a little bit
but as i said smooth surfaces cause
less friction so it's very easy to ride
your bike
on a smooth uh trail or a smooth road
but if you go into nature of course you
don't have this nice smooth road you
have a lot of rocks
and maybe dirt and there's little bumps
so
we call that a rough surface a rough
surface
causes more friction and you need more
force
to make yourself go farther
you have to put more force into your
bike on a on the road you know she
doesn't have to worry too much she just
pedals a little bit
it's very easy riding but on a rough
surface you have to pedal more
to make more force because you're losing
a lot of force
on the rough surface okay good
let's do the reading together as usual i
will read out loud
you guys repeat after me either out loud
or
in your mind and focus on the words that
we learned in the vocabulary
also focus on pronunciation are you guys
ready
let's begin
force is a push or a pull
on an object if you push
or pull something you can change
its position it takes more
force to move a heavy object than a
light
object
if you kick a ball the ball will move
away
from you the harder you kick
the ball the farther it will move
if you kick a ball up into the air
it will follow a curved line
to the ground gravity
is pulling the ball down
the amount of force that pulls something
down toward earth is called
its weight gravity always
pulls objects towards
the ground
if you bounce a ball it will go
up and then down
friction is a force that makes an object
slow down when it moves over
another object smooth
surfaces cause less friction
than rough ones
okay let's talk about how the
information in this reading passage
is organized here we have main idea and
details
so the main idea of course is a very
general statement
and the supporting details are examples
or
specific ideas that support that main
idea
what is the main idea the main idea is
force is a push
or pull on an object those are the types
of forces
we're talking about and we can say
gravity
of course pulls things friction
uh pushes against things okay
so what are the main what are the
supporting details the first one the
harder you bounce a ball
the harder what does that mean harder it
means the force you use
to bounce a ball on the ground if you
just drop the ball
it won't bounce very high but if you
throw the ball down
very hard it will bounce what the
more it will move upwards the more
it will move upwards so if you throw it
down really hard
it will move upwards more now we could
use more
or we could use farther we saw both
words
in the reading the more it will move
upwards or the farther
it will move upwards from the ground
okay farther means
distance a farther distance
okay so if you kick a ball of course if
you kick the ball the ball will move
away from you the ball will move away of
course because you kick it
and it moves away from you of course as
it moves away
it will move in a curved line back
towards the earth
and that is a push by the way if you
kick the ball that's a push
okay a very strong push okay next we
have
beep is a force now what kind of force
we have two forces gravity
and friction that we were talking about
so in this case we're talking about when
one object moves over another object
so ah that force is called friction
right we talked about that
friction friction is a force that
happens when one
object moves over another object
and it slows it down now beep
is a force oh that's the other type of
force that always pulls objects
towards the ground it pulls it towards
the ground
what force was that that we talked about
of course
that was gravity gravity
okay so again we don't think about these
forces a lot right
but they are always acting around us
gravity thank goodness it is always
pulling us to the ground without gravity
everything would just be floating around
in space
right that's not good we would not be
here
if it weren't for gravity so of course
gravity is a very good force it keeps us
on the ground and it's interesting too
because if you go to a very large planet
a planet that is much larger than earth
the gravity is much stronger and you
can't move around
but if you go to a planet or an object
that is lighter
if you notice the moon landing when the
astronauts were on the moon they could
jump really high
because the gravity wasn't that strong
on the moon
interesting okay so gravity can change
depending on where you
are of course normally we're just on
earth so we don't think about it but
it is an interesting idea friction of
course
is always around us because it it's the
it's the force that slows things down
when we were when we move uh one object
on another
friction is important of course when we
ride our bikes when your parents drive
their car if they take the
if they take their foot off the gas the
car will just naturally slow down as
long as it's not going downhill
as long as there's no gravity if the car
is going flat the car will eventually
slow down
because there's friction between the
tires and the
and the street that slows the car down
and that's of course is good too if
there were no friction everybody would
be sliding all over the place
and you would have no way to stop that
would be terrible so friction is also
very useful
in our lives okay so this lesson was
about two interesting forces
and it's also talking about pushing and
pulling uh so that's
these are interesting ideas to think
about when we look at the world around
us
okay i hope that you learned a lot of
good words in this
vocabulary a lot of useful words and
also some useful ideas
okay we'll see you in the next video
lesson take care everybody bye bye

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading my name is brian
00:12
stewart
00:13
and in this lesson we're looking at
00:14
science book 4
00:16
lesson 12 forces
00:19
in this unit or in this lesson you will
00:22
discover
00:23
two types of force and what effect
00:27
friction has on moving objects
00:31
what is friction well let's find out
00:34
okay in the vocabulary section our first
00:37
word is
00:38
pull now this is a force that you can
00:41
make
00:41
pull means to move something towards you
00:45
so in this case the horse
00:48
is pulling the cart or the buggy
00:52
because the horse is pulling it towards
00:54
it
00:55
if you take something and you make it
00:58
move
00:58
towards you you are pulling it like a
01:02
door
01:02
right a door will say push
01:06
or pull when you go to a
01:09
business right you go to a coffee shop
01:12
and you open the door look at the door
01:13
it says
01:14
push or pull if it says pull pull the
01:17
door towards you
01:18
okay we'll talk about push in a second
01:22
if it says push push it away from you
01:24
okay so those are our opposite words
01:27
push and pull so if you pull the door
01:30
you pull it towards you if you push it
01:32
you move something
01:34
away from you see now in this situation
01:37
this girl is pushing the
01:40
cart or the wheelbarrow away from her so
01:43
she's pushing it
01:44
the horse is pulling the girl is pushing
01:47
okay so these are opposite forces
01:51
okay pull and push
01:54
next we have bounce that's a fun word
01:57
isn't it
01:57
you can bounce a ball right it means to
02:00
move
02:00
up or away from a surface after hitting
02:03
it
02:04
so if you bounce a ball you throw the
02:06
ball on the ground
02:08
it hits the ground and bounces back up
02:10
if you go to some places some fun places
02:14
you can bounce yourself right you can
02:16
jump onto like a big
02:18
air uh container or tube and
02:22
you will compress it and you'll bounce
02:24
your whole body will bounce back
02:26
up that's fun isn't it right it's a
02:28
bouncing room right
02:29
so to bounce means to move up or away
02:32
from a surface
02:33
after hitting it and of course we like
02:35
to play with balls right
02:37
we throw a ball against a wall it
02:39
bounces back and we catch it
02:41
okay so you can play tennis by yourself
02:43
if you want to right
02:45
against a wall or you can play table
02:48
tennis also
02:49
but of course many people all like to
02:51
play uh
02:53
just with a ball bouncing it to each
02:54
other or just bouncing it by yourself
02:57
and of course basketball is a sport
03:00
where they really bounce the ball a lot
03:02
so that's bounce okay
03:06
gravity now gravity is a force
03:09
right it's a very strong force and it
03:12
pulls
03:12
everything towards the ground
03:16
a few lessons ago we talked about the
03:19
planets
03:19
that go around the sun every very
03:23
every object has some force some
03:25
attraction
03:26
uh that that attracts other objects to
03:29
it
03:29
the bigger the object the stronger the
03:32
force so imagine the sun is
03:34
very very huge it's very big so it has a
03:37
lot of gravity
03:38
and that's what keeps those planets of
03:40
course the planets have gravity too
03:42
and that's what keeps them going around
03:44
each other instead of just
03:46
flying off into space thankfully the
03:49
earth has gravity
03:50
we are all being pulled
03:53
to the center of the earth but not too
03:55
strong our muscles are strong enough
03:57
so we can move around but it's
04:00
thankfully strong enough it keeps us on
04:02
the ground so we don't go flying away
04:05
that's not good either okay
04:06
so gravity we're used to the earth's
04:09
gravity
04:10
it keeps us on the ground keeps every
04:12
object on the ground
04:16
next we have friction friction is
04:18
another type of force it's a force
04:20
between
04:20
two objects moving over each other
04:24
now here i have to be careful and say
04:26
moving over each other
04:28
in english you know if you have an
04:30
object here
04:31
right and the ground is here and this
04:33
object is moving
04:35
yes the object is moving over the ground
04:38
but this if the object is touching the
04:41
ground
04:41
and also moving but it's touching it's
04:44
also
04:44
over the ground so in this case i'm not
04:47
talking about this situation
04:49
i'm talking about this situation when
04:52
two objects
04:53
move over when one object moves over
04:56
another object but they are touching not
04:59
here
05:00
they are touching then you have friction
05:02
here there's no friction
05:04
right but here yes you have friction
05:07
so they have to be touching not just
05:09
over each other but
05:10
also touching like the golf ball right
05:13
the golf ball over the grass
05:15
the golf ball as it's moving it has
05:17
friction it's slowing down
05:19
because it's actually touching the grass
05:23
okay surface the surface is the top
05:28
part of something the picture here shows
05:30
the surface
05:31
of the ocean right we can't see
05:34
underneath the surface of the ocean
05:36
we only see the surface it's the top
05:38
part of something
05:39
my skin we only see the surface of the
05:42
skin thankfully we don't see
05:44
what's underneath right so we just see
05:47
the surface
05:48
of the skin okay so those are so those
05:51
are our words
05:52
in the vocabulary section some of them
05:54
are kind of interesting maybe a little
05:56
difficult
05:57
let's explore them more in more detail
06:00
in the two ideas and the reading section
06:06
now the first idea the first main idea
06:09
of this lesson we're going to talk about
06:11
two of the vocabulary words in more
06:12
detail we have gravity
06:14
and we have friction these are the two
06:17
types of forces
06:18
that we're going to look at in this
06:20
lesson so as i explained before gravity
06:23
is a force that pulls everything to the
06:26
earth's center because the earth is very
06:28
large
06:28
it has a strong gravity a
06:32
strong force of gravity so gravity is a
06:34
force
06:35
that pulls down things towards the earth
06:39
the amount of force the amount how much
06:42
force right the amount of force how much
06:44
force
06:45
that pulls something down toward the
06:47
earth is called its
06:48
weight so weight
06:51
refers to how much does something weigh
06:55
how heavy is an object
06:58
of course if you have a very heavy
07:01
object you have a piece of metal
07:03
let's say gold gold is very heavy you
07:05
drop it
07:06
it falls very quickly it has a strong
07:09
force
07:11
that is pulling it towards the center of
07:13
the earth that's how much
07:15
it weighs but if you take a feather
07:17
right a feather how much does a feather
07:19
weigh
07:20
a feather weighs almost nothing and you
07:22
drop it it just slowly goes down to the
07:25
earth right
07:26
of course we're talking about friction
07:28
with the air but that's another another
07:30
idea if something is very heavy
07:33
it has a stronger force pulling it
07:36
towards the earth if something is very
07:37
light
07:38
it falls not so with not as much
07:41
force right okay if you drop a heavy
07:44
object on your foot
07:45
that's going to hurt if you drop a light
07:47
object on your foot
07:48
it's just going to bounce off right so
07:51
how much something weighs
07:53
how heavy is it determines the force
07:57
that it falls towards the earth how
07:59
strong that force is
08:01
that it falls towards the earth and
08:03
that's what gravity is
08:05
well that's a that a feature of gravity
08:08
is not what gravity is
08:10
but it's a feature of gravity it's the
08:11
amount of force that pulls something
08:13
down
08:14
towards the earth okay now next we have
08:17
friction
08:18
now friction is another force right and
08:21
it makes an
08:22
object slow down when it moves
08:25
over another object and when it moves
08:27
over another object
08:28
of course it's touching consider this
08:30
boy he's on what we call
08:32
rollerblades i don't know if you
08:34
remember rollerblades they were very
08:36
popular
08:37
a long time ago and of course maybe
08:39
nowadays too
08:42
but rollerblades as this boy is skating
08:45
or rollerblading
08:46
on the ground of course he's touching
08:48
the ground the wheels are touching
08:50
the surface of you know where he's
08:53
rollerblading
08:54
if he's rollerblading on a smooth
08:56
surface
08:57
and he pushes off he's going to go
08:59
farther right he's going to he's going
09:01
to travel
09:02
a longer distance but if he's going over
09:06
a rough surface like there's a lot of
09:09
you know
09:10
ups and downs like it's a it's not very
09:12
even it's not very smooth it's
09:14
it's rough it's bumpy then of course
09:17
he's not going to travel as far because
09:19
there's more friction
09:21
friction is a force that makes an object
09:23
slow down
09:25
when it moves over another object think
09:28
about
09:28
ice right if you like ice skates another
09:31
example
09:32
ice when water freezes the surface
09:36
of the ice is very smooth right
09:39
it's very slippery too so you can
09:42
there's not a lot of friction
09:44
when you push off on ice skates you
09:46
don't have to push in just push off once
09:48
and you go a long ways now think about
09:52
if you're on rollerblades and you're on
09:54
uh
09:55
like a bumpy uh surface you know maybe
09:58
the
09:59
the people who made the road they didn't
10:01
do a good job it's not very cert
10:03
it's not very flat it's got little bumps
10:05
a little stone sticking up out of the
10:07
tar
10:08
that's a bumpy road right if you push
10:10
off you're not going to go very far
10:12
because it's a rough surface so if it's
10:15
smooth
10:16
you will there's not as much friction if
10:19
it's bumpy
10:19
there's more friction and of course when
10:22
two objects meet each other
10:24
they have friction between them so if
10:26
you want to eliminate something you want
10:28
to go faster
10:29
make a smooth surface but if you want to
10:32
slow things down
10:33
make a bumpy surface that's part of the
10:36
reason
10:36
why the roads near your house might have
10:39
a bump
10:40
of course the other reason is that the
10:42
driver doesn't want to go boom like this
10:44
when he drives his car so of course he
10:45
slows down
10:46
but anyway that's a different idea
10:48
anyway that's friction
10:49
okay so we have two forces gravity and
10:52
friction gravity is a force
10:53
pulling things to the earth friction is
10:56
the force that slows objects down
10:58
as they move on top of another surface
11:02
okay now the next idea is what effect
11:06
friction has on moving objects i already
11:09
talked about this a little bit
11:10
but as i said smooth surfaces cause
11:13
less friction so it's very easy to ride
11:16
your bike
11:17
on a smooth uh trail or a smooth road
11:20
but if you go into nature of course you
11:23
don't have this nice smooth road you
11:25
have a lot of rocks
11:26
and maybe dirt and there's little bumps
11:29
so
11:30
we call that a rough surface a rough
11:32
surface
11:33
causes more friction and you need more
11:35
force
11:36
to make yourself go farther
11:40
you have to put more force into your
11:42
bike on a on the road you know she
11:44
doesn't have to worry too much she just
11:45
pedals a little bit
11:46
it's very easy riding but on a rough
11:48
surface you have to pedal more
11:50
to make more force because you're losing
11:52
a lot of force
11:53
on the rough surface okay good
11:59
let's do the reading together as usual i
12:01
will read out loud
12:02
you guys repeat after me either out loud
12:05
or
12:06
in your mind and focus on the words that
12:09
we learned in the vocabulary
12:10
also focus on pronunciation are you guys
12:14
ready
12:14
let's begin
12:18
force is a push or a pull
12:21
on an object if you push
12:24
or pull something you can change
12:28
its position it takes more
12:32
force to move a heavy object than a
12:35
light
12:36
object
12:38
if you kick a ball the ball will move
12:41
away
12:42
from you the harder you kick
12:45
the ball the farther it will move
12:50
if you kick a ball up into the air
12:53
it will follow a curved line
12:56
to the ground gravity
12:59
is pulling the ball down
13:03
the amount of force that pulls something
13:07
down toward earth is called
13:10
its weight gravity always
13:14
pulls objects towards
13:17
the ground
13:20
if you bounce a ball it will go
13:23
up and then down
13:26
friction is a force that makes an object
13:30
slow down when it moves over
13:34
another object smooth
13:37
surfaces cause less friction
13:41
than rough ones
13:45
okay let's talk about how the
13:47
information in this reading passage
13:49
is organized here we have main idea and
13:52
details
13:53
so the main idea of course is a very
13:55
general statement
13:56
and the supporting details are examples
13:59
or
13:59
specific ideas that support that main
14:02
idea
14:04
what is the main idea the main idea is
14:06
force is a push
14:07
or pull on an object those are the types
14:11
of forces
14:12
we're talking about and we can say
14:15
gravity
14:16
of course pulls things friction
14:19
uh pushes against things okay
14:22
so what are the main what are the
14:24
supporting details the first one the
14:26
harder you bounce a ball
14:27
the harder what does that mean harder it
14:29
means the force you use
14:31
to bounce a ball on the ground if you
14:34
just drop the ball
14:35
it won't bounce very high but if you
14:37
throw the ball down
14:38
very hard it will bounce what the
14:42
more it will move upwards the more
14:46
it will move upwards so if you throw it
14:48
down really hard
14:49
it will move upwards more now we could
14:51
use more
14:52
or we could use farther we saw both
14:55
words
14:56
in the reading the more it will move
14:59
upwards or the farther
15:01
it will move upwards from the ground
15:03
okay farther means
15:04
distance a farther distance
15:08
okay so if you kick a ball of course if
15:10
you kick the ball the ball will move
15:13
away from you the ball will move away of
15:16
course because you kick it
15:17
and it moves away from you of course as
15:20
it moves away
15:21
it will move in a curved line back
15:23
towards the earth
15:25
and that is a push by the way if you
15:27
kick the ball that's a push
15:29
okay a very strong push okay next we
15:32
have
15:33
beep is a force now what kind of force
15:35
we have two forces gravity
15:37
and friction that we were talking about
15:39
so in this case we're talking about when
15:41
one object moves over another object
15:44
so ah that force is called friction
15:47
right we talked about that
15:49
friction friction is a force that
15:52
happens when one
15:54
object moves over another object
15:57
and it slows it down now beep
16:00
is a force oh that's the other type of
16:02
force that always pulls objects
16:05
towards the ground it pulls it towards
16:07
the ground
16:08
what force was that that we talked about
16:10
of course
16:11
that was gravity gravity
16:15
okay so again we don't think about these
16:18
forces a lot right
16:20
but they are always acting around us
16:23
gravity thank goodness it is always
16:26
pulling us to the ground without gravity
16:29
everything would just be floating around
16:31
in space
16:31
right that's not good we would not be
16:34
here
16:34
if it weren't for gravity so of course
16:37
gravity is a very good force it keeps us
16:39
on the ground and it's interesting too
16:42
because if you go to a very large planet
16:44
a planet that is much larger than earth
16:46
the gravity is much stronger and you
16:48
can't move around
16:50
but if you go to a planet or an object
16:52
that is lighter
16:53
if you notice the moon landing when the
16:56
astronauts were on the moon they could
16:58
jump really high
16:59
because the gravity wasn't that strong
17:02
on the moon
17:03
interesting okay so gravity can change
17:06
depending on where you
17:07
are of course normally we're just on
17:10
earth so we don't think about it but
17:11
it is an interesting idea friction of
17:14
course
17:15
is always around us because it it's the
17:17
it's the force that slows things down
17:20
when we were when we move uh one object
17:23
on another
17:23
friction is important of course when we
17:25
ride our bikes when your parents drive
17:27
their car if they take the
17:29
if they take their foot off the gas the
17:31
car will just naturally slow down as
17:33
long as it's not going downhill
17:34
as long as there's no gravity if the car
17:36
is going flat the car will eventually
17:38
slow down
17:39
because there's friction between the
17:41
tires and the
17:43
and the street that slows the car down
17:46
and that's of course is good too if
17:48
there were no friction everybody would
17:50
be sliding all over the place
17:51
and you would have no way to stop that
17:53
would be terrible so friction is also
17:55
very useful
17:56
in our lives okay so this lesson was
17:59
about two interesting forces
18:00
and it's also talking about pushing and
18:02
pulling uh so that's
18:04
these are interesting ideas to think
18:06
about when we look at the world around
18:08
us
18:09
okay i hope that you learned a lot of
18:10
good words in this
18:12
vocabulary a lot of useful words and
18:15
also some useful ideas
18:17
okay we'll see you in the next video
18:18
lesson take care everybody bye bye
18:29
[Music]
18:41
you
