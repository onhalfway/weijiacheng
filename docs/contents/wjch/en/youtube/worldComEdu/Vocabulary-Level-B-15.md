well
what do you do you understand
if you study something and you study it
and you get to know it then you
understand it
okay sometimes you don't need to study
you just understand
right away you know it very well you
understand understand so
understand is a verb we use it as an
irregular verb
understand understood understood
actually if we just look at stand right
stand as a verb stand and stood stood
but that's it that's to stand right but
in this case we're saying
understood to know something but it
follows the same pattern as just
stand stand stood stood understand
understood understood i understood your
lesson
i have understood i have understood

truth what is the truth what is
the real story okay in this case

little hard but think about this if an
airplane what happened here this is a
very
tragic unfortunate event the airplane
dropped suddenly from the sky what did
it do

when two
cars crash they don't drop suddenly
but you know they just hit each other

that's good
that's a good habit number 14

she is kind to be friendly to be nice to
other people
to be kind 15.
a machine this is a machine that flies
in the air have you ever been in this
machine
have you ever taken a flight on a plane
of course this machine is called a plane
and you can call it
airplane but many people just say plane
for short let's take a plane to hawaii
how will you get to cejado i will take
a plane take a plane or fly
on a plane okay 16 looks like he's
in a hurry right he's waiting for
something to happen
in a short time if you say something's
in a short time
it will happen soon don't worry it will
happen
soon right just a short time from now
in a short time soon okay those are our
words
let's take a look at the exercises okay
in this exercise we need to find the
word in the box
that means the same or
almost the same as the underlined word
or words a little complicated let's look
here
here we have a sentence the doctor gave
the sick boy
a shot and if we see a shot
is underlined so we have to find
the word in the box that means the same
or
almost the same as this part right here
that's underlined and we can write that
here okay
so number one of course oh sorry let's
go over the words first right
the words are understand understand
next one crashed crashed
next one quit quit
next one hospitals hospitals
notice that it's plural right more than
one
two three four five so on medicine
medicine and visited
visited notice it's past
tense okay so our first one is the
doctor gave the sick boy a
shot so if you're sick and you go
to the hospital you see a doctor the
doctor gives you a shot
what is in the shot what is the shot
what is that that's of course is
medicine
it's medicine inside the shot so you can
take medicine like a pill
right that you put in your mouth and
drink water you
you swallow the medicine sometimes
though medicine is given to you with a
needle
apply oh that's not good right it's not
fun
but it's necessary you need it sometimes
so a shot is medicine number two
the girl fell down while riding a
bicycle
so the girl was riding her bicycle up
right she falls down
what happened fell down it what's the
word that is similar to that
in the box of course it's crashed the
girl
crashed while riding a bicycle you could
say that too
the girl crashed while riding a bicycle
she fell down
okay the next one is number three tim
wants to stop working for mr brown
tim wants to stop working he's working
for a long
time he wants to stop doing that
okay so stop doing something which word
is that
quits right tim wants to quit
working for mr brown of course you could
just say tim wants to quit
but don't say tim wants to quit for mr
brown that's a different meaning right
you would say tim wants to quit he or he
wants to quit
working for mr brown he wants to quit
doing something so when somebody stops
working
at their job you can say where is bob
oh he quit he's not in the office
anymore
right he's not here anymore he quit he
left his job but of course you can quit
many things okay number four a doctor
knows how to help a sick person so
somebody
knows something very well right they've
studied it or they have a lot of
experience
what is it they understand
a doctor understands how to help
a sick person so a doctor understands
how to help a sick person you could use
it it's the same
meaning okay number five
roberto right we got roberto again went
to see
the sick children so when you go
somewhere
to see somebody you go somewhere to see
them
what are you doing you're visiting them
so robert visited the sick
children visit is fine right but if
you're going to use it in the sentence
you could just put roberto vizier
ted exactly like that like the box the
sick children
that's an okay sentence roberto visited
the sick
children number six doctors and nurses
doctors and nurses work in a special
buildings
for sick people what are special
buildings for sick people where do you
see
a word that means a special building for
sick
people of course we're looking at this
word right here
hospitals right so you could just
substitute
this whole thing and put hospitals
doctors and nurses
work in hospitals and you could say that
too
okay so those are our words for the
uh vocabulary checkup right uh
let's take a short break now and we'll
come back and take a look at the reading
