hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
in today's lesson we're looking at
social studies
book 4 lesson 9 changes
in people's lives think about
a long time ago how did people live back
then
and how do you live now what kind of
changes
have there been well in this lesson you
will discover
what artifacts are and also
four great inventions from china
so let's get started of course we always
start with the vocabulary and our first
word in this lesson
is museum have you ever been
to a museum a museum is a place where
important historical things are
displayed
so people gather things from a long time
ago and they put them in the museum
because we can learn about how people
lived
in the past and a museum is a good place
to go
to see these things
next we have artifact so i just said we
go to a museum
to see these things from the past these
things we can call them
artifacts because an artifact is an
object
that was made a very long time ago
so when you go to the museum you can see
things that were made hundreds of years
ago
thousands of years ago made by people
who lived a long time ago
and we call these things artifacts
from the past okay
carriage have you ever ridden in a
carriage
probably not they used there used to be
carriages everywhere right
many people used to ride in carriages in
many countries all around the world
but a carriage is a kind of vehicle with
wheels
that was pulled by horses so we have a
horse
drawn carriage some very common to say
horse drawn
carriage because drawn in this case
means
pulled the horse is pulling the carriage
and in fact
as you can see this is a modern picture
and in some parts of america
some people still live in an
old traditional way they don't believe
in using cars or even electricity
they don't have cell phones they don't
use electric lights in their houses
and they don't use cars instead they
have horses
and carriages to get around
and so you can still see this actually
in some parts of america like
pennsylvania
ohio uh so in that area
okay so that's very interesting but
anyway carriage
uh is a horse-drawn carriage an old type
of transportation
invention an invention is something that
someone has made for the first
time so if you grow older or even now if
you have a great idea
and you make something that has never
been made before and it's useful
many people want to use it you might
become a famous
inventor right because you have made a
useful
invention something that someone has
made for the first
time and of course we see this picture
who are these two
famous inventors well you can see their
name it's in this is a french
uh stamto it's in it's in french but
that's fine
uh wilbur uh and orville wright so it's
orville
and wilbur wright although orville is
spelled in the french way
and wilbur wright the wright brothers
what did they invent
they invented the airplane or a flying
machine
okay so they are famous inventors but
there's many famous inventors
in history communicate
to communicate that's a long word isn't
it communicate
communicate
basically that means to express your
ideas or your feelings
or to exchange information right now i'm
communicating to you
with the words that are coming out of my
mouth but i'm also communicating
with you in other ways i'm using body
language
people can communicate without speaking
they can just communicate with their
facial expressions
you can also communicate by writing
something to someone or typing it on
your computer
so there are many different ways to
communicate
with other people and of course animals
communicate with each other
as well also by their body language by
the sounds they make
and by the actions that they do that is
also a type of
communication so there are many types of
communication
connect connect means to link
two things together to connect something
to an a well in this case an electrical
or communication
system so if you are connected to the
internet
you use a cell phone or a computer
to connect to the internet to link
to the internet to be connected to it
okay
also if you have a lamp let's say you
buy a new lamp you
take it home you plug it into the wall
you connect the lamp
to the electric system in your house
okay
so to connect to link two things
together in this case we're talking
about linking something to the
electrical
or communication system
next we have telegraph what is a
telegraph
of course you don't remember that's a
lot i don't remember
right that's a very long time ago people
wanted to communicate over very long
distances
but they didn't have computers they
didn't have the internet they didn't
even have telephones
what was the first way to communicate
over a very long distance
well of course you might think oh fires
yeah and smoke
right korea had a very developed system
to warn
uh people of foreign invaders coming
into the country
with smoke but a lot of countries did
that sometimes they used drums
right but smoke and fire were also good
communication devices
but then they invented something what
that was called the telegraph and the
telegraph
used wires and electricity and you could
spread the wires really far between two
people
and if you typed or you tapped basically
the telegraph was just a little
instrument
you tapped on it and it made a sound
and you could hear that sound over the
wire hundreds of miles or hundreds of
kilometers even thousands of kilometers
away from each other one person could
tap on one part
and another person on the other end of
the wire could hear those
taps and what they did was they used
short tap
and a long tap and that was called morse
code
morse code morse code
and they had a series of dots and dashes
so
right so you could and you can make
letters
so these dots and these dashes
corresponded
to different letters of the alphabet and
so people who were very good
at using the telegraph were called
telegraph
operators operators telegraph
operators they would sit there and
they'd hit the lookie
and they were very good they knew the
code and they could send messages
very far distances so it's an electric
system for sending a long distance
message
and by the way telegraph operators they
call them telegraph operators because
they
operated the telegraph machine and of
course when telephones came
later on we we got rid of telegraphs but
we kept the word
operator so it's very common on the
phone people would
call and they just dial zero zero for
the operator
and they would say operator please
connect me to so and so in new york
and the operator would would make the
call for you okay
so it's interesting words that are
developed for one technology
are sometimes carried over to the next
technology
okay but anyway telegraph okay next
internet of course we don't use
telegraphs anymore
that would take all day to sit there tap
tap tap right
now we use the internet and we can get
we don't just type we don't just send
words to each other we send pictures and
movies
and sound we get all sorts of different
types of communication
can be transferred over the internet and
of course the internet is a worldwide
computer network
so we're not just talking about
thousands of kilometers we're talking
about
all over the world basically anywhere
almost
anywhere in the world you can go you can
get
connected to the internet and
communicate with somebody on the other
side of the world
so we are living in a very fortunate
time you're very lucky of course to have
the internet these days
okay well those that's our vocabulary
for this lesson
let's continue with the main ideas
now one main idea from this lesson is
what we're talking about in the
vocabulary we talked about
artifacts right and we said artifacts
are things
from a very long time ago artifacts tell
us how people
lived long ago because usually there are
things that people
made to make their lives easier to make
their lives more convenient
what did they use how did they live well
as we saw
also in the vocabulary we saw the word
carriage and of course i said
horse drawn carriage in the past
you know even as little as uh 150 years
ago or
even a hundred years ago people still
used carriages
to move around back and forth of course
1905 was really the
the date when uh cars automobiles were
mass-produced started to become
mass-produced
but it took a while for cars to replace
horse-drawn carriages
so horse-drawn carriages were still used
even after 1905.
so um people used carriages in the past
and sure they were the fastest way to
get around
right at that time of course nowadays
people drive around in
cars right and cars have horsepower
right again like i said
vocabulary from old technology is used
in new technology
so your car you know you can ask
somebody well what is the horsepower
of the engine in the car and they might
say well it's 300 horsepower
that means it's the same power as 300
horses
just in this little car well thankfully
you don't have to have 300 horses
that would take a lot of space and a lot
of money to feed them every day
but that's just but now you have a
machine that is the same power
as maybe 300 400 horses in your car
so technology moves on and becomes more
powerful
and more convenient that's the first one
carriages have
given way to cars and then also in the
vocabulary we talked about telegraphs
and i told you a long time ago
a telegraph operator like this person
here
would sit and they would tap on the key
well that's a very old
and primitive method of communication
we think of it nowadays as primitive
because now we have the internet
and the internet of course we can
communicate with people very quickly
even in real time we can talk to each
other
over the internet we can even show each
other videos
of each other in real time over the
internet so that's a
huge advance in technology over the
telegraph
oh and i didn't mention this before but
of course these things were talking
about
technology you probably
already know this word technology and
many times people just shorten it
and they just say tech right
but technology is the development of
uh inventions and things that we use to
make our lives more convenient
so we can say technology has improved
a lot over the past 100 years
okay another
main idea from this lesson is four great
inventions
of ancient china so many countries have
different inventions
and we're going to take a look at
ancient ancient china means a long time
ago in china right
and there are four great inventions
inventions of course and these are
artifacts or things that people used a
long time ago
to improve their technology
so what are some four things first of
all is paper
uh paper was invented paper is a great
invention
because a long time ago of course people
when they developed
writing what did they write on paper
wasn't readily available
you just can't go to the store and buy
some paper nobody knew what paper was
you know so when writing was first
developed uh or
in the middle east people used to first
write on
clay clay is soft mud and they would
make indentations in the clay
the clay aft if you leave it in the sun
it would dry out and become hard
so that the clay tablets could be passed
but
if you drop it it's it shatters and all
your writing is gone
right so then people used to write on
like
animal skins or they used to write on
tree bark
but of course these things are heavy and
they're thick they're not very
convenient
so when paper was developed that was a
great invention because now paper is
very
thin it's light you can roll it up you
can fold it and you can carry it with
you
for long distances so that's paper
next was gun powder gun powder is a
mixture of sulfur
salt peter and i think some other
chemicals or
materials compounds and of course if you
touch a flame to it it burns
very quickly and if you put the
gunpowder in a
container so that when it burns it it
doesn't have a way to expand
then it might explode now of course
there were many uses for gunpowder
the chinese of course invented
fireworks you know for display and that
of course
used gunpowder but they also
used cannon or artillery so they could
shoot
projectiles they could shoot gunpowder
was used to
to force big steel balls or other metal
balls
at somebody like the enemy so of course
gunpowder was used
in wartime and many countries around
china
also used gunpowder in korea i think you
had the huacha
i hope i pronounced that right but that
was a it also used gunpowder to fire
many arrows at the enemy
it was a very deadly instrument of war
oh he said gunpowder
next we have compass now a compass was
very important for navigation especially
for
sailors if you're exploring or if you're
going across
land you can see mountains you can see
you know trees you can follow rivers
you have many landmarks that you can
follow to know where you're going
but if you're on the ocean there are no
landmarks and if it's a cloudy day
you can't even see the sun so you don't
know where is west or where's
east and you might not you can't see the
stars many people would navigate with
the stars but if there's clouds
you can't see the stars so you don't
know where you are
but a compass is of course
usually water with a magnetic piece of
metal
in the water and that magnetic piece of
metal will always point
north so if you know where north is you
can figure out where the other
directions are
that's a compass so compass was very
important
for helping people navigate for helping
people
explore and find new areas they knew
which direction they were going in
if they had a compass and it didn't
matter if it was raining
or it was very cloudy they could still
find their way
okay printing printing of course
is very connected with paper of that's
those two inventions are very closely
connected
uh a printing press isn't a is of course
the ability
to make many copies of
a written piece of a written document
so yeah you could have paper but imagine
if you wanted to send a message to 10
different people
you have to write that message on 10
different pieces of paper by hand
it takes a long time but what if there
was a way
where you could write it once and then
you could just press
the ink on the paper 10 times very
quickly
and then you can send out your 10
messages that's much easier
and that's what the printing press or
the printing
invention did and it's that was of
course especially important in china
because china was such a big country
and when the government wanted to send
messages to all the governors or all the
local officials
they had to send out hundreds of
messages probably the same message
so it was a very useful invention
at that time okay so those are the two
main ideas for this lesson
let's take a look at the reading okay
and as usual as i read aloud
read along with me or read along in your
mind focus on the words
from the vocabulary are you guys ready
let's begin
it is fun to look at how people lived
in america in the past and see
how it has changed over time
of course not just in america but in the
world as well
museums are a great place to look at
interesting artifacts on display
artifacts show us how people lived
long ago
a carriage for example is just one
artifact
we can see in a museum
now people use cars to move around
but a long time ago the carriage was the
fastest
way to travel hmm
i don't know maybe but i think just
riding on a horse
was the was faster okay so anyway but
not everybody rode on horses okay the
carriages were easier
okay anyway in the museums
we can see how inventions changed the
way
people lived for example communication
has changed a lot
in the past people used the telegraph
to communicate from place to place
but it was not an easy way
to connect with other people
nowadays we use the internet
to connect with family and friends all
over the world okay let's take a look at
how this reading passage is organized
and as we can see here
the information in the reading passage
was organized along the lines of compare
and contrast now of course compare means
to show how
two things or several things are the
same
how are they the same contrast means how
are they
different and in this case we are
contrasting
we are contrasting the past with the
present we're showing how the past
is different from the present oh and by
the way
when we talk about the past we can and
we talk about what people
did in the past we can say in
the past
when we talk about the present of course
we can say
in the present but it's also very easy
just to say
nowadays nowadays so of course you can
say
in the present but it's easier to say
nowadays and many people just say
nowadays so in the past they did this
nowadays they do this okay so
let's take a look at how the past is
different from
the present in the past a
beep was the fastest way to travel now
again i made a comment about this in the
reading i hope i didn't confuse you
but remember the reading passage said a
what was the fastest way to
to travel remember a horse drawn
carriage right so c-a-r-r-i-a-g-e
a horse-drawn carriage was the fastest
way to travel
of course i made the comment that i
think if you're just on if one rider is
on a horse
that's faster but i guess for a large
group of people you know in a carriage
would be faster
okay but anyway okay so use the carriage
to travel
but that was in the past nowadays people
use
what what do they use of course they use
cars
people use cars to move around
by the way people still use carriages
in some places but this is talking about
generally most people right
in the past most people almost all
people used carriages to get around
nowadays almost everyone uses a car
still some people use carriages though
anyway so that's one example of the
difference between
the past and the present another example
is how
people used to communicate well in the
past
people use the what to communicate
remember that little machine
that makes the long dash and the short
dot that was of course
of course called the telegraph tell the
graph the telegraph
and that was a very old
actually primitive by today's standards
way to communicate
nowadays what do you use to connect with
family and friends
all over the world of and you probably
use it every day
yeah of course it's the internet
internet
and of course when we write internet we
usually use a capital i
most people use capital i for internet
because
it was you know when it first came out
people uh
regarded it as you know they just named
it that way it was like a name so they
use the
capital i for internet that's just
common practice nowadays
so usually use a capital i when you
write
internet excuse me okay well this lesson
was interesting
because it's very interesting these are
just two examples
of the difference between the way people
lived in the past
and the way people live nowadays there
are many
other examples and it's like the passage
said it is fun to think about these
things
think about other ways that people lived
in the past how did they live their
lives
and how do we live our lives now there's
a big change
so it's really interesting to think
about that and of course to
look at different inventions and
different ways that technology
has improved over the years so
i hope you learned some good words or
some
useful words in english through this
lesson and also that it gave you some
good ideas for learning on your own take
a look at other
inventions or other ways that people
lived in the past
and also learn about inventors these
smart
women and men who invented things to
make our
lives easier and more convenient today
okay well that wraps up our lesson
thanks for standing with me as always
and i hope to see you in the next lesson
take care everybody
bye bye
you

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading
00:11
in today's lesson we're looking at
00:13
social studies
00:14
book 4 lesson 9 changes
00:18
in people's lives think about
00:21
a long time ago how did people live back
00:25
then
00:26
and how do you live now what kind of
00:28
changes
00:30
have there been well in this lesson you
00:32
will discover
00:33
what artifacts are and also
00:37
four great inventions from china
00:40
so let's get started of course we always
00:44
start with the vocabulary and our first
00:46
word in this lesson
00:47
is museum have you ever been
00:51
to a museum a museum is a place where
00:54
important historical things are
00:57
displayed
00:58
so people gather things from a long time
01:00
ago and they put them in the museum
01:02
because we can learn about how people
01:05
lived
01:06
in the past and a museum is a good place
01:08
to go
01:09
to see these things
01:13
next we have artifact so i just said we
01:15
go to a museum
01:16
to see these things from the past these
01:20
things we can call them
01:21
artifacts because an artifact is an
01:24
object
01:25
that was made a very long time ago
01:28
so when you go to the museum you can see
01:31
things that were made hundreds of years
01:33
ago
01:34
thousands of years ago made by people
01:37
who lived a long time ago
01:39
and we call these things artifacts
01:42
from the past okay
01:46
carriage have you ever ridden in a
01:50
carriage
01:51
probably not they used there used to be
01:53
carriages everywhere right
01:54
many people used to ride in carriages in
01:57
many countries all around the world
01:59
but a carriage is a kind of vehicle with
02:02
wheels
02:03
that was pulled by horses so we have a
02:07
horse
02:08
drawn carriage some very common to say
02:11
horse drawn
02:15
carriage because drawn in this case
02:18
means
02:18
pulled the horse is pulling the carriage
02:21
and in fact
02:22
as you can see this is a modern picture
02:24
and in some parts of america
02:26
some people still live in an
02:29
old traditional way they don't believe
02:33
in using cars or even electricity
02:36
they don't have cell phones they don't
02:38
use electric lights in their houses
02:40
and they don't use cars instead they
02:42
have horses
02:43
and carriages to get around
02:46
and so you can still see this actually
02:48
in some parts of america like
02:49
pennsylvania
02:51
ohio uh so in that area
02:54
okay so that's very interesting but
02:56
anyway carriage
02:57
uh is a horse-drawn carriage an old type
03:00
of transportation
03:04
invention an invention is something that
03:07
someone has made for the first
03:09
time so if you grow older or even now if
03:12
you have a great idea
03:14
and you make something that has never
03:16
been made before and it's useful
03:19
many people want to use it you might
03:21
become a famous
03:22
inventor right because you have made a
03:25
useful
03:26
invention something that someone has
03:28
made for the first
03:30
time and of course we see this picture
03:32
who are these two
03:33
famous inventors well you can see their
03:36
name it's in this is a french
03:38
uh stamto it's in it's in french but
03:40
that's fine
03:41
uh wilbur uh and orville wright so it's
03:44
orville
03:44
and wilbur wright although orville is
03:46
spelled in the french way
03:48
and wilbur wright the wright brothers
03:50
what did they invent
03:52
they invented the airplane or a flying
03:55
machine
03:56
okay so they are famous inventors but
03:58
there's many famous inventors
04:00
in history communicate
04:04
to communicate that's a long word isn't
04:06
it communicate
04:08
communicate
04:11
basically that means to express your
04:13
ideas or your feelings
04:15
or to exchange information right now i'm
04:18
communicating to you
04:19
with the words that are coming out of my
04:22
mouth but i'm also communicating
04:24
with you in other ways i'm using body
04:26
language
04:27
people can communicate without speaking
04:29
they can just communicate with their
04:31
facial expressions
04:33
you can also communicate by writing
04:36
something to someone or typing it on
04:38
your computer
04:39
so there are many different ways to
04:41
communicate
04:42
with other people and of course animals
04:44
communicate with each other
04:46
as well also by their body language by
04:48
the sounds they make
04:50
and by the actions that they do that is
04:52
also a type of
04:53
communication so there are many types of
04:57
communication
05:00
connect connect means to link
05:03
two things together to connect something
05:06
to an a well in this case an electrical
05:08
or communication
05:09
system so if you are connected to the
05:12
internet
05:13
you use a cell phone or a computer
05:16
to connect to the internet to link
05:19
to the internet to be connected to it
05:22
okay
05:22
also if you have a lamp let's say you
05:24
buy a new lamp you
05:25
take it home you plug it into the wall
05:28
you connect the lamp
05:29
to the electric system in your house
05:32
okay
05:33
so to connect to link two things
05:35
together in this case we're talking
05:36
about linking something to the
05:38
electrical
05:38
or communication system
05:42
next we have telegraph what is a
05:44
telegraph
05:46
of course you don't remember that's a
05:48
lot i don't remember
05:49
right that's a very long time ago people
05:52
wanted to communicate over very long
05:54
distances
05:55
but they didn't have computers they
05:57
didn't have the internet they didn't
05:58
even have telephones
06:00
what was the first way to communicate
06:02
over a very long distance
06:04
well of course you might think oh fires
06:06
yeah and smoke
06:07
right korea had a very developed system
06:10
to warn
06:10
uh people of foreign invaders coming
06:13
into the country
06:14
with smoke but a lot of countries did
06:15
that sometimes they used drums
06:17
right but smoke and fire were also good
06:20
communication devices
06:21
but then they invented something what
06:24
that was called the telegraph and the
06:25
telegraph
06:26
used wires and electricity and you could
06:29
spread the wires really far between two
06:32
people
06:33
and if you typed or you tapped basically
06:36
the telegraph was just a little
06:37
instrument
06:38
you tapped on it and it made a sound
06:41
and you could hear that sound over the
06:43
wire hundreds of miles or hundreds of
06:46
kilometers even thousands of kilometers
06:48
away from each other one person could
06:50
tap on one part
06:52
and another person on the other end of
06:54
the wire could hear those
06:56
taps and what they did was they used
06:59
short tap
07:00
and a long tap and that was called morse
07:02
code
07:04
morse code morse code
07:08
and they had a series of dots and dashes
07:11
so
07:14
right so you could and you can make
07:16
letters
07:17
so these dots and these dashes
07:19
corresponded
07:20
to different letters of the alphabet and
07:23
so people who were very good
07:25
at using the telegraph were called
07:27
telegraph
07:28
operators operators telegraph
07:32
operators they would sit there and
07:34
they'd hit the lookie
07:37
and they were very good they knew the
07:38
code and they could send messages
07:41
very far distances so it's an electric
07:43
system for sending a long distance
07:45
message
07:46
and by the way telegraph operators they
07:48
call them telegraph operators because
07:49
they
07:50
operated the telegraph machine and of
07:52
course when telephones came
07:54
later on we we got rid of telegraphs but
07:57
we kept the word
07:58
operator so it's very common on the
08:00
phone people would
08:01
call and they just dial zero zero for
08:04
the operator
08:05
and they would say operator please
08:06
connect me to so and so in new york
08:08
and the operator would would make the
08:10
call for you okay
08:12
so it's interesting words that are
08:14
developed for one technology
08:16
are sometimes carried over to the next
08:18
technology
08:19
okay but anyway telegraph okay next
08:22
internet of course we don't use
08:24
telegraphs anymore
08:26
that would take all day to sit there tap
08:28
tap tap right
08:29
now we use the internet and we can get
08:31
we don't just type we don't just send
08:33
words to each other we send pictures and
08:36
movies
08:36
and sound we get all sorts of different
08:39
types of communication
08:40
can be transferred over the internet and
08:43
of course the internet is a worldwide
08:46
computer network
08:47
so we're not just talking about
08:48
thousands of kilometers we're talking
08:50
about
08:51
all over the world basically anywhere
08:54
almost
08:54
anywhere in the world you can go you can
08:57
get
08:57
connected to the internet and
08:59
communicate with somebody on the other
09:01
side of the world
09:02
so we are living in a very fortunate
09:05
time you're very lucky of course to have
09:08
the internet these days
09:10
okay well those that's our vocabulary
09:12
for this lesson
09:14
let's continue with the main ideas
09:20
now one main idea from this lesson is
09:22
what we're talking about in the
09:23
vocabulary we talked about
09:24
artifacts right and we said artifacts
09:27
are things
09:28
from a very long time ago artifacts tell
09:30
us how people
09:32
lived long ago because usually there are
09:34
things that people
09:35
made to make their lives easier to make
09:38
their lives more convenient
09:39
what did they use how did they live well
09:42
as we saw
09:44
also in the vocabulary we saw the word
09:46
carriage and of course i said
09:47
horse drawn carriage in the past
09:50
you know even as little as uh 150 years
09:54
ago or
09:55
even a hundred years ago people still
09:56
used carriages
09:58
to move around back and forth of course
10:00
1905 was really the
10:02
the date when uh cars automobiles were
10:05
mass-produced started to become
10:07
mass-produced
10:08
but it took a while for cars to replace
10:10
horse-drawn carriages
10:12
so horse-drawn carriages were still used
10:15
even after 1905.
10:18
so um people used carriages in the past
10:20
and sure they were the fastest way to
10:22
get around
10:23
right at that time of course nowadays
10:26
people drive around in
10:27
cars right and cars have horsepower
10:30
right again like i said
10:32
vocabulary from old technology is used
10:35
in new technology
10:36
so your car you know you can ask
10:38
somebody well what is the horsepower
10:41
of the engine in the car and they might
10:44
say well it's 300 horsepower
10:46
that means it's the same power as 300
10:49
horses
10:50
just in this little car well thankfully
10:52
you don't have to have 300 horses
10:54
that would take a lot of space and a lot
10:56
of money to feed them every day
10:58
but that's just but now you have a
11:00
machine that is the same power
11:02
as maybe 300 400 horses in your car
11:06
so technology moves on and becomes more
11:08
powerful
11:09
and more convenient that's the first one
11:12
carriages have
11:14
given way to cars and then also in the
11:17
vocabulary we talked about telegraphs
11:19
and i told you a long time ago
11:21
a telegraph operator like this person
11:23
here
11:24
would sit and they would tap on the key
11:26
well that's a very old
11:28
and primitive method of communication
11:32
we think of it nowadays as primitive
11:34
because now we have the internet
11:36
and the internet of course we can
11:38
communicate with people very quickly
11:40
even in real time we can talk to each
11:43
other
11:43
over the internet we can even show each
11:46
other videos
11:47
of each other in real time over the
11:49
internet so that's a
11:50
huge advance in technology over the
11:53
telegraph
11:54
oh and i didn't mention this before but
11:56
of course these things were talking
11:58
about
12:00
technology you probably
12:02
already know this word technology and
12:04
many times people just shorten it
12:06
and they just say tech right
12:09
but technology is the development of
12:13
uh inventions and things that we use to
12:16
make our lives more convenient
12:18
so we can say technology has improved
12:21
a lot over the past 100 years
12:24
okay another
12:28
main idea from this lesson is four great
12:31
inventions
12:32
of ancient china so many countries have
12:35
different inventions
12:36
and we're going to take a look at
12:37
ancient ancient china means a long time
12:40
ago in china right
12:41
and there are four great inventions
12:43
inventions of course and these are
12:45
artifacts or things that people used a
12:48
long time ago
12:49
to improve their technology
12:53
so what are some four things first of
12:54
all is paper
12:56
uh paper was invented paper is a great
12:58
invention
12:59
because a long time ago of course people
13:02
when they developed
13:03
writing what did they write on paper
13:05
wasn't readily available
13:07
you just can't go to the store and buy
13:08
some paper nobody knew what paper was
13:11
you know so when writing was first
13:13
developed uh or
13:14
in the middle east people used to first
13:17
write on
13:17
clay clay is soft mud and they would
13:20
make indentations in the clay
13:22
the clay aft if you leave it in the sun
13:24
it would dry out and become hard
13:26
so that the clay tablets could be passed
13:29
but
13:29
if you drop it it's it shatters and all
13:32
your writing is gone
13:34
right so then people used to write on
13:37
like
13:37
animal skins or they used to write on
13:40
tree bark
13:41
but of course these things are heavy and
13:42
they're thick they're not very
13:44
convenient
13:45
so when paper was developed that was a
13:47
great invention because now paper is
13:49
very
13:49
thin it's light you can roll it up you
13:52
can fold it and you can carry it with
13:54
you
13:54
for long distances so that's paper
13:58
next was gun powder gun powder is a
14:00
mixture of sulfur
14:02
salt peter and i think some other
14:04
chemicals or
14:05
materials compounds and of course if you
14:08
touch a flame to it it burns
14:12
very quickly and if you put the
14:14
gunpowder in a
14:16
container so that when it burns it it
14:19
doesn't have a way to expand
14:20
then it might explode now of course
14:23
there were many uses for gunpowder
14:25
the chinese of course invented
14:28
fireworks you know for display and that
14:31
of course
14:31
used gunpowder but they also
14:34
used cannon or artillery so they could
14:36
shoot
14:37
projectiles they could shoot gunpowder
14:40
was used to
14:41
to force big steel balls or other metal
14:44
balls
14:46
at somebody like the enemy so of course
14:48
gunpowder was used
14:49
in wartime and many countries around
14:53
china
14:53
also used gunpowder in korea i think you
14:55
had the huacha
14:57
i hope i pronounced that right but that
14:59
was a it also used gunpowder to fire
15:01
many arrows at the enemy
15:03
it was a very deadly instrument of war
15:06
oh he said gunpowder
15:07
next we have compass now a compass was
15:10
very important for navigation especially
15:12
for
15:13
sailors if you're exploring or if you're
15:17
going across
15:18
land you can see mountains you can see
15:20
you know trees you can follow rivers
15:22
you have many landmarks that you can
15:25
follow to know where you're going
15:28
but if you're on the ocean there are no
15:30
landmarks and if it's a cloudy day
15:32
you can't even see the sun so you don't
15:34
know where is west or where's
15:36
east and you might not you can't see the
15:38
stars many people would navigate with
15:40
the stars but if there's clouds
15:42
you can't see the stars so you don't
15:44
know where you are
15:45
but a compass is of course
15:49
usually water with a magnetic piece of
15:52
metal
15:53
in the water and that magnetic piece of
15:54
metal will always point
15:57
north so if you know where north is you
15:59
can figure out where the other
16:00
directions are
16:01
that's a compass so compass was very
16:04
important
16:05
for helping people navigate for helping
16:08
people
16:09
explore and find new areas they knew
16:12
which direction they were going in
16:14
if they had a compass and it didn't
16:15
matter if it was raining
16:17
or it was very cloudy they could still
16:19
find their way
16:20
okay printing printing of course
16:24
is very connected with paper of that's
16:27
those two inventions are very closely
16:28
connected
16:29
uh a printing press isn't a is of course
16:32
the ability
16:33
to make many copies of
16:36
a written piece of a written document
16:40
so yeah you could have paper but imagine
16:42
if you wanted to send a message to 10
16:44
different people
16:45
you have to write that message on 10
16:48
different pieces of paper by hand
16:50
it takes a long time but what if there
16:52
was a way
16:53
where you could write it once and then
16:55
you could just press
16:57
the ink on the paper 10 times very
16:59
quickly
17:00
and then you can send out your 10
17:02
messages that's much easier
17:04
and that's what the printing press or
17:06
the printing
17:08
invention did and it's that was of
17:10
course especially important in china
17:11
because china was such a big country
17:13
and when the government wanted to send
17:15
messages to all the governors or all the
17:17
local officials
17:18
they had to send out hundreds of
17:20
messages probably the same message
17:22
so it was a very useful invention
17:26
at that time okay so those are the two
17:28
main ideas for this lesson
17:32
let's take a look at the reading okay
17:34
and as usual as i read aloud
17:36
read along with me or read along in your
17:38
mind focus on the words
17:40
from the vocabulary are you guys ready
17:43
let's begin
17:45
it is fun to look at how people lived
17:49
in america in the past and see
17:52
how it has changed over time
17:56
of course not just in america but in the
17:58
world as well
18:01
museums are a great place to look at
18:04
interesting artifacts on display
18:08
artifacts show us how people lived
18:12
long ago
18:15
a carriage for example is just one
18:18
artifact
18:19
we can see in a museum
18:22
now people use cars to move around
18:26
but a long time ago the carriage was the
18:30
fastest
18:30
way to travel hmm
18:34
i don't know maybe but i think just
18:37
riding on a horse
18:38
was the was faster okay so anyway but
18:41
not everybody rode on horses okay the
18:44
carriages were easier
18:45
okay anyway in the museums
18:49
we can see how inventions changed the
18:53
way
18:54
people lived for example communication
18:57
has changed a lot
18:59
in the past people used the telegraph
19:03
to communicate from place to place
19:07
but it was not an easy way
19:10
to connect with other people
19:15
nowadays we use the internet
19:18
to connect with family and friends all
19:21
over the world okay let's take a look at
19:25
how this reading passage is organized
19:27
and as we can see here
19:29
the information in the reading passage
19:31
was organized along the lines of compare
19:34
and contrast now of course compare means
19:37
to show how
19:38
two things or several things are the
19:40
same
19:41
how are they the same contrast means how
19:43
are they
19:44
different and in this case we are
19:47
contrasting
19:48
we are contrasting the past with the
19:51
present we're showing how the past
19:52
is different from the present oh and by
19:55
the way
19:56
when we talk about the past we can and
19:58
we talk about what people
19:59
did in the past we can say in
20:03
the past
20:06
when we talk about the present of course
20:09
we can say
20:09
in the present but it's also very easy
20:12
just to say
20:13
nowadays nowadays so of course you can
20:16
say
20:16
in the present but it's easier to say
20:19
nowadays and many people just say
20:21
nowadays so in the past they did this
20:24
nowadays they do this okay so
20:27
let's take a look at how the past is
20:29
different from
20:30
the present in the past a
20:33
beep was the fastest way to travel now
20:36
again i made a comment about this in the
20:38
reading i hope i didn't confuse you
20:40
but remember the reading passage said a
20:43
what was the fastest way to
20:45
to travel remember a horse drawn
20:48
carriage right so c-a-r-r-i-a-g-e
20:54
a horse-drawn carriage was the fastest
20:58
way to travel
20:59
of course i made the comment that i
21:00
think if you're just on if one rider is
21:03
on a horse
21:04
that's faster but i guess for a large
21:05
group of people you know in a carriage
21:07
would be faster
21:08
okay but anyway okay so use the carriage
21:11
to travel
21:12
but that was in the past nowadays people
21:15
use
21:16
what what do they use of course they use
21:18
cars
21:20
people use cars to move around
21:23
by the way people still use carriages
21:27
in some places but this is talking about
21:29
generally most people right
21:31
in the past most people almost all
21:33
people used carriages to get around
21:35
nowadays almost everyone uses a car
21:38
still some people use carriages though
21:40
anyway so that's one example of the
21:43
difference between
21:44
the past and the present another example
21:46
is how
21:47
people used to communicate well in the
21:50
past
21:50
people use the what to communicate
21:53
remember that little machine
21:54
that makes the long dash and the short
21:56
dot that was of course
21:58
of course called the telegraph tell the
22:02
graph the telegraph
22:06
and that was a very old
22:09
actually primitive by today's standards
22:12
way to communicate
22:14
nowadays what do you use to connect with
22:17
family and friends
22:18
all over the world of and you probably
22:20
use it every day
22:21
yeah of course it's the internet
22:24
internet
22:26
and of course when we write internet we
22:28
usually use a capital i
22:29
most people use capital i for internet
22:32
because
22:33
it was you know when it first came out
22:35
people uh
22:36
regarded it as you know they just named
22:38
it that way it was like a name so they
22:40
use the
22:40
capital i for internet that's just
22:43
common practice nowadays
22:44
so usually use a capital i when you
22:47
write
22:48
internet excuse me okay well this lesson
22:51
was interesting
22:52
because it's very interesting these are
22:54
just two examples
22:55
of the difference between the way people
22:57
lived in the past
22:59
and the way people live nowadays there
23:02
are many
23:02
other examples and it's like the passage
23:05
said it is fun to think about these
23:07
things
23:08
think about other ways that people lived
23:10
in the past how did they live their
23:12
lives
23:13
and how do we live our lives now there's
23:15
a big change
23:16
so it's really interesting to think
23:18
about that and of course to
23:20
look at different inventions and
23:23
different ways that technology
23:25
has improved over the years so
23:28
i hope you learned some good words or
23:31
some
23:32
useful words in english through this
23:34
lesson and also that it gave you some
23:36
good ideas for learning on your own take
23:39
a look at other
23:40
inventions or other ways that people
23:42
lived in the past
23:43
and also learn about inventors these
23:45
smart
23:46
women and men who invented things to
23:49
make our
23:50
lives easier and more convenient today
23:53
okay well that wraps up our lesson
23:55
thanks for standing with me as always
23:57
and i hope to see you in the next lesson
23:59
take care everybody
24:00
bye bye
24:08
you
