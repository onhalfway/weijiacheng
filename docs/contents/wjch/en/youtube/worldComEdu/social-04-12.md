hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
my name is brian stewart and we're
looking at social studies book for
lesson 12 in the bank
now i know you're probably too young to
worry about the bank
or money but it's really never too early
to think about
saving your money right so in this
lesson we will discover
how people save and spend money
and also why people save money
so let's begin we have many
words in the vocabulary section about
saving money
the first one is deposit deposit can be
a verb
and it can also be a noun
in this case it's a verb because we see
two
to put then we are we know it's a verb
so
to put to put money in a bank so
do you have any money if your parents
give you some allowance maybe
every week maybe you could ask your mom
or your dad to help you
make a bank uh account
and you can deposit when you put money
in the bank
you deposit the money in the bank you
could also
make a deposit in that case it's a noun
to make a deposit a deposit
is the act of putting money in the bank
that's a noun
so it can be a verb or it can be a noun
to deposit money in a bank
or to make a deposit okay
next we have in return
if i give you something will you give me
something
in return in return is as a way of
paying someone for something
when you go to the store right and you
want to buy
a key no i'm just kidding that's some
other situation you want to buy
candy or a toy right you give the
store owner or the person who works at
the store
you give them some money in return
they give you the object that you want
to buy
this picture shows maybe somebody's
buying a
car or maybe they're buying a house
or something that's not a lot of money
to buy
well i don't know what what currency is
that oh i thought that was korean money
i don't know what currency that is so
i'm not sure how much money that is but
maybe they'll make many payments
but anyway you give money in return the
person gives you something else
so you give someone a they give you b
in return okay it's a way of paying
someone
for something okay the next word is
interest now interest are you interested
in this lesson
okay well that's a different meaning of
interest right so but anyway
in this case we're talking about
interest at a bank it's the
extra money that you receive you
get from having money in a bank
this is a little complicated or a little
uh
difficult concept but let me make it
easy for you
let's say you have ten dollars
right you have ten dollars or mon one
and you put it into the bank usually
maybe the bank will give you
two percent interest
two percent interest that means
after one year they will give you two
percent
of the money you have in the bank
they'll just give it to you
just for having your money in the bank
what is two percent of ten dollars
well two percent of ten dollars is zero
point
two zero dollars right that's 20 cents
it's not a lot of money but it is some
money right and
it's free well it's free you put it in
the bank you don't use it
and the bank gives you money why does
the bank do that
because if another person borrows ten
dollars
or if they borrow ten dollars then the
bank
charges the charges them interest that's
a different type of interest
at interest they might charge that
person
five percent interest so basically
at the end of the year that person has
to pay back
ten dollars plus
fifty cents because five percent of ten
dollars
is fifty cents right so if you borrow
that money
you have to pay back ten dollars plus
fifty cents
the bank what happens with the bank the
bank of course what's the difference
between 50 cents
and 20 cents is 30 cents
right so the bank makes money
by doing that anyway that's that's
interest
the main idea is that if you put your
money in the bank
the bank will give you a small
percentage of that
back every year every half year it
depends on what the bank policy is
they will give you a small percentage of
your money back
in interest so if you have a lot of
money you put in the bank
you get interest on that money
you don't have to do anything just keep
it in the bank of course the bank is
using your money
to make money themselves and they give
you a percentage of that
but that's interest that's the extra
money you receive
from the money you have in the bank
check okay now this lesson
is of course from the american textbook
reading series american americans use
checks and this is a good picture of a
check now many countries
don't use checks for example in korea
you do not use
checks so it's a little difficult to
explain this concept sometimes
to koreans and in fact i appreciate the
korean system
more than i do the american system when
i was in america of course i
you have a savings account and you have
a checking account
they're different it might be the same
bank but your savings account
that's just money you put in there and
you don't take the money out you just
get interest
but then you have a checking account you
open a checking account you put money in
there
and the bank the bank doesn't give you
checks the bank
makes you buy a checkbook with checks in
it
that's another way they make money
anyway that's american banks
and then when you go to the store right
you go to the store and you want to buy
something
now you can use money right just paper
money
and just give them the money or you can
use a check
or you can use a credit card so you're
going to pay by cash
by check or by credit by cash
by cheque or by credit those are three
different ways
to pay at a store or restaurant when you
want to buy something
now a check of course is a piece of
paper like this
it's in a book that you tear off you
might have 50 or 100 checks in your book
and it's a piece of paper that orders a
bank
to pay money from a checking account now
let me show you how the check works here
up here you put the date so you might
put august
5th and then of course the year 2020
and then you say here it says pay to the
order of and you write the name of the
restaurant
so let's say abc restaurant abc
restaurant and then
here it says how much a thousand dollars
oh my god what did you eat
okay i'm just kidding but that's you
know a thousand dollars right there okay
so then you have to spell that out for
some reason they just put thousand
you should put one and they already
spelled out thousand one thousand
dollars
and then here that's optional you can
say uh
i ate uh 100 big macs
right big macs i was really hungry
okay and then you sign right you just
sign your name
on this part here now what happens is
you give that
check to the to the restaurant owner and
the restaurant owner takes those checks
you know they get maybe many checks from
many different customers
they go to the bank and they put those
checks into their bank account
now their bank might be abc bank and
your bank is xyz bank
so they put their check in the abc bank
abc bank
sends the checks to your bank a xyz bank
and xyz bank takes the money out of your
checking account
and sends it to the restaurant owner's
uh bank account it's very complicated
okay
but that's how many americans will pay
for things
now paying by check is a little
old-fashioned these days
many americans still use checks checks
are still very common in america
but people are moving away from checks
and they're doing internet banking or
wire transfers in korea of course you do
a lot of wire transfers
or internet banking i like the korean
system much better
checks are old-fashioned okay
hopefully korea will never use
checks okay it's much simpler just to
have one bank account
and don't worry about checks and just
have internet banking on your phone
or just transfer money at an atm
okay but checks are a little bit
complicated
but they're mostly in america and other
countries will use them as well
i'm familiar with the american system
because i did use checks
when i was younger when i moved to korea
no checks
much easier count yourself lucky okay
okay
next bill what is a bill
a bill is a piece of paper
listing costs that you should pay for
using goods or services well
of course um you should pay your bills
with money obviously but a bill let's
say you go to the grocery store
that's what this is looks like they went
to the grocery store and they bought
raspberries and raspberries
what is it two 299. so they bought
raspberries
raspberries are 2.99 and they also
bought
uh oh it looks like italian parmesan
cheese
and that was two dollars and seven cents
though so the bill lists
everything that they bought if you go to
a restaurant
again using the restaurant example you
buy
a meal but you might buy a salad too and
a drink
all of those items are listed on the
bill and the total
is on the bottom of the bill the total
is how much
you should pay and usually they also add
tax
to that so that is the bill
and bills are just statements saying how
much you
owe a person or a company because you
used their goods or services
okay that is a bill
credit card i mentioned this before of
course that's one of the ways to pay
people
for using their goods or services you
can pay cash you can pay by check
you can pay by credit card of course
many people just say buy credit
they don't say card but that's okay a
credit card is a plastic card that you
can use
instead of cash it's very convenient
it's much better than using a check
just give them your card and it
automatically takes
the money out of your bank account well
that's a debit card
credit card oh with when you use a
credit card
that's a good difference there's a
credit card there's a debit card
a debit card it just automatically comes
out of your bank account
with a credit card at the end of the
month you get a bill
the credit card company will send you a
bill say okay
uh you charged you used your credit card
at this store you used your credit card
at this restaurant
two days later every day and the amount
the money that you that you used at each
store
is listed on your credit card bill and
at the end of the month
you pay that bill so that's another
example of a bill
savings account we talked about savings
account right that's the money
if you put money into a bank you put in
your savings account
it's a bank account that earns interest
usually again in america savings
accounts
give you more interest than a checking
account i'm not sure if checking
accounts give you interest
or not there's that's just money that
you use for your checking account
but savings accounts usually give you
more
money in interest
checking account is the next checking
account a bank account
which you can take money out of at any
time
using your checkbook or cash card cash
card
i said debit card it's also called
debit card cash card so uh
and again that's the american system
right they have two different types of
accounts they have a savings account and
a checking account you have to have two
different accounts you have to keep two
different
separate uh amounts of money in the bank
you don't have to have a savings account
you could just have a checking account
but you won't earn any interest on it or
not very much interest on it
thankfully in many other countries like
in korea you just have
one account and you can tie your credit
card to it
you can tie your cash card or debit card
to it you don't worry about checks
and you also earn interest on it so it's
a savings account but it's also an
account where you can actually use that
money
with a card or just withdrawing or wire
transferring money
so that's it the difference of course in
america you have the difference between
savings account
and a checking account okay good
so those are our words for the
vocabulary
let's talk about the first main idea
here and that is about saving
and spending money how do people save
money how do people
spend money over here we have some
examples
of how people save money and over on the
right side
we have some examples of how people
spend money
of course money is very important in our
society we it's very convenient to be
able to exchange
or use goods and services so
how do you save money you can open a
savings account
at the bank that's one way to save money
uh people deposit
deposit they put their money another way
to say deposit is
put money in the bank that's to deposit
people deposit their money in their
savings accounts
and the bank adds interest to the
accounts
in return if you save your money with
our bank
we will give you interest in return so
you
give them your money they're giving you
some money back
it's it's kind of like a service right
you're choosing the bank to manage your
money
and as in return they give you interest
for trusting them or using them for
uh keeping your money okay so that's how
you save money
open a bank account it's a good idea
even if you're young
it's probably never too early
to open a bank account in your name
start saving money
it's very important for your life okay
spending money now of course we need to
spend money don't spend all your money
of course
be wise choose wisely when you spend
your money
but how do people spend money well of
course
this person here is a customer and she
is going to
pay with a check at a restaurant so
she's giving
the waiter a check now of course she can
pay the bill
right this is the bill here the waiter
is giving the customer bill and she's
giving
the waiter some form of payment this
could be cash it could be credit card
it could be a check in this case we're
talking about a check
so she gives the waiter a check the
restaurant
sends the check to the customer's bank
we talked about this before
the bank takes the money from the
customer's checking account
and sends it to the restaurant's banking
account and that's how the the the money
is finally transferred
so you see checking is is more difficult
a checking account is more difficult
that system is more difficult
it adds another step in the process
and it's it's getting it's really an
old-fashioned way
of transferring money from one person to
another
thankfully many countries don't use
checking accounts
unfortunately americans still use
checking accounts quite often
they may not realize how inconvenient it
is compared to other systems
but as an american myself i can tell you
it's much easier in korea
to don't worry about a checking account
just use a debit card
a credit card or just transfer money
from one account to the other
so anyway that is how people will save
money and that is how people will
spend money
another idea in this unit why people
save money and i encourage you
i encourage you to save money even if
you don't have a bank account
maybe you have a piggy bank right a
little pig with
with a slot in the top you can put bills
in there you can also put coins in there
save it up okay and you can use it in
the future
so why do people save money well maybe
they want to buy a new bicycle right
that's a good reason
you can save your money to buy something
big later on a bicycle is expensive
you don't have enough money now but if
you save your money over time
then you can buy something more
expensive later on that you really want
or that you really need now it's also
important to go to college
college costs a lot of money so people
need to save money
probably your mom or your dad has an
account
at a bank that's for your college
spending
many parents do this they save money for
their children to go to college
because college is expensive they don't
have all the money right away
so every month they put a little bit of
money aside and after a long time
as you grow up that money gets bigger
and bigger and then you can go to
college on that money
you can also save for your own college
as well
a little bit and help your mom and dad
some people save money
to go abroad that means to travel to
another country
and that's also very uh good use of
money because it's always good to travel
and experience new cultures new
languages new ways of thinking
traveling abroad is always a good idea
and ex
be careful where you go of course but uh
uh you know go there to learn about new
people
new customs new languages very
interesting it's
it's educational as well so people will
will save money to buy or to
purchase expensive things in the future
whether it's a new bicycle a college
education
or a trip abroad so people save money
to buy goods and services in the future
that's the main reason why people
will save money so it's a good idea if
you want something
big in the future start saving now
okay okay let's take a look at the
reading passage
as usual i will read it out loud you
guys repeat it after me either out loud
or
in your mind focus on the vocabulary
words
and of course focus on pronunciation for
all the words
especially the more difficult ones are
you guys ready
let's begin we all
need to spend and save
money using a bank is the usual way
that people save their money
each week my parents give me five
dollars i keep three dollars
and i deposit two dollars
in my savings account
in return the bank gives me interest
so that my two dollars grows into
more money
that is why people save money in a bank
my parents also deposit money in a bank
my dad writes a check to pay bills
for things like electricity and gas the
money
is taken out of the checking account
each month
my parents also have a credit card
they use this to pay for expensive
things
like cars or tvs
when i get older i will also use a
checking account
and a credit card to spend my money
okay let's go over how this information
was organized
in the reading passage here we have
cause
on the left side and effect on the right
side
cause is an action you do an action and
there is a result
the result is the effect of that action
we have two actions here one
and two and then of course we have two
results or two effects
of those actions so what's the first
action let's go over these
each week my parents give me five
dollars
right great i beep two dollars
in my savings account so what does the
person do the person who's writing this
reading passage
they when they take money
and they deposit into their savings
account so they deposit we use the word
deposit
now of course you could also use put
put is a broad verb it has
many meanings for many different
situations you put your
toys in a box you put your clothes
in the closet but when we're talking
about putting money in a bank
that is a specific idea we use a more
specific verb
deposit you deposit the money into the
bank of course you can say i put the
money in the bank
but deposit is especially specifically
used for putting money into a bank so
you deposit two dollars
into your savings account what happens
as a result of that the bank gives me
what the bank gives me they'll give me a
little bit of money back and we call
that interest interest
the bank gives me interest there we go
the bank gives me interest on the money
in my
savings account okay good that's the
first cause and effect
the second cause and effect my dad
writes what he well he writes a check
right we talked about that in the
vocabulary and i wrote one for you as an
example
so your dad writes a check why does he
write a check because
every month he gets many what's
right of course in your household you
use electricity you use
gas you might of course you use water
and maybe other services in your
neighborhood or in your town
and the companies that are providing
these services will send you
a written statement listing those
services and how much they cost
of course we talked about those and so
uh
every month your mom and dad have to pay
bills
so your dad might write a check right
what is the result of that
well the money that is taken out of the
what again this is an american situation
you have a savings account
and you have a checking account so the
money is taken out of the checking
account
it's two words actually
checking account each month okay so and
i know this can be
sometimes confusing to people who are
who don't
uh use banking systems like the american
system
uh don't worry about it uh you know if
you're in america you have to open a
checking account and you will have to
learn
what is a checking account and how to
use it if you're
in many other countries that don't have
a checking account
be happy you are lucky you don't have to
deal with that system which is kind of
old-fashioned
and kind of difficult to deal with
it's much easier of course just to use a
debit card a credit card
or cash or just to wire money okay so
that is our lesson for today it's a good
lesson though because
it's very important to start thinking
about money
how much will you save are there
purchases are there things you want to
buy in your future
that cost a lot of money you have to
start
saving your money and a good place to
save your money
is in a bank because they will give you
interest
if you need to save money for a very
long period of time
then put your money in the bank and they
will give you interest
on your money so you're like making
money for not doing anything
just putting the money in the bank so
that's a good idea
of course when you get older and of
course now you spend money and there are
many different
ways to spend money we went over a few
of those
in this lesson okay well thanks for
studying with me as always
i hope you learned some useful words and
some
useful ideas about life okay
take it easy everybody we'll see in the
next lesson bye-bye
you

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:11
textbook reading
00:12
my name is brian stewart and we're
00:13
looking at social studies book for
00:16
lesson 12 in the bank
00:20
now i know you're probably too young to
00:22
worry about the bank
00:24
or money but it's really never too early
00:27
to think about
00:28
saving your money right so in this
00:30
lesson we will discover
00:32
how people save and spend money
00:35
and also why people save money
00:39
so let's begin we have many
00:42
words in the vocabulary section about
00:45
saving money
00:46
the first one is deposit deposit can be
00:50
a verb
00:51
and it can also be a noun
00:55
in this case it's a verb because we see
00:57
two
00:58
to put then we are we know it's a verb
01:01
so
01:01
to put to put money in a bank so
01:05
do you have any money if your parents
01:07
give you some allowance maybe
01:09
every week maybe you could ask your mom
01:12
or your dad to help you
01:13
make a bank uh account
01:16
and you can deposit when you put money
01:19
in the bank
01:20
you deposit the money in the bank you
01:23
could also
01:24
make a deposit in that case it's a noun
01:27
to make a deposit a deposit
01:30
is the act of putting money in the bank
01:32
that's a noun
01:33
so it can be a verb or it can be a noun
01:35
to deposit money in a bank
01:37
or to make a deposit okay
01:42
next we have in return
01:46
if i give you something will you give me
01:49
something
01:49
in return in return is as a way of
01:53
paying someone for something
01:55
when you go to the store right and you
01:57
want to buy
01:58
a key no i'm just kidding that's some
02:00
other situation you want to buy
02:02
candy or a toy right you give the
02:05
store owner or the person who works at
02:08
the store
02:09
you give them some money in return
02:12
they give you the object that you want
02:15
to buy
02:16
this picture shows maybe somebody's
02:18
buying a
02:19
car or maybe they're buying a house
02:23
or something that's not a lot of money
02:26
to buy
02:26
well i don't know what what currency is
02:28
that oh i thought that was korean money
02:30
i don't know what currency that is so
02:31
i'm not sure how much money that is but
02:33
maybe they'll make many payments
02:34
but anyway you give money in return the
02:37
person gives you something else
02:39
so you give someone a they give you b
02:42
in return okay it's a way of paying
02:46
someone
02:46
for something okay the next word is
02:50
interest now interest are you interested
02:53
in this lesson
02:54
okay well that's a different meaning of
02:55
interest right so but anyway
02:57
in this case we're talking about
02:58
interest at a bank it's the
03:01
extra money that you receive you
03:04
get from having money in a bank
03:08
this is a little complicated or a little
03:10
uh
03:11
difficult concept but let me make it
03:13
easy for you
03:15
let's say you have ten dollars
03:18
right you have ten dollars or mon one
03:21
and you put it into the bank usually
03:25
maybe the bank will give you
03:27
two percent interest
03:30
two percent interest that means
03:33
after one year they will give you two
03:36
percent
03:37
of the money you have in the bank
03:39
they'll just give it to you
03:40
just for having your money in the bank
03:42
what is two percent of ten dollars
03:44
well two percent of ten dollars is zero
03:48
point
03:48
two zero dollars right that's 20 cents
03:53
it's not a lot of money but it is some
03:56
money right and
03:57
it's free well it's free you put it in
04:00
the bank you don't use it
04:01
and the bank gives you money why does
04:04
the bank do that
04:05
because if another person borrows ten
04:08
dollars
04:09
or if they borrow ten dollars then the
04:11
bank
04:12
charges the charges them interest that's
04:14
a different type of interest
04:16
at interest they might charge that
04:18
person
04:19
five percent interest so basically
04:22
at the end of the year that person has
04:24
to pay back
04:26
ten dollars plus
04:29
fifty cents because five percent of ten
04:32
dollars
04:32
is fifty cents right so if you borrow
04:36
that money
04:37
you have to pay back ten dollars plus
04:39
fifty cents
04:41
the bank what happens with the bank the
04:43
bank of course what's the difference
04:44
between 50 cents
04:46
and 20 cents is 30 cents
04:50
right so the bank makes money
04:54
by doing that anyway that's that's
04:57
interest
04:58
the main idea is that if you put your
05:00
money in the bank
05:01
the bank will give you a small
05:03
percentage of that
05:06
back every year every half year it
05:08
depends on what the bank policy is
05:10
they will give you a small percentage of
05:13
your money back
05:14
in interest so if you have a lot of
05:16
money you put in the bank
05:18
you get interest on that money
05:21
you don't have to do anything just keep
05:22
it in the bank of course the bank is
05:24
using your money
05:26
to make money themselves and they give
05:28
you a percentage of that
05:29
but that's interest that's the extra
05:31
money you receive
05:33
from the money you have in the bank
05:38
check okay now this lesson
05:41
is of course from the american textbook
05:44
reading series american americans use
05:48
checks and this is a good picture of a
05:49
check now many countries
05:51
don't use checks for example in korea
05:53
you do not use
05:54
checks so it's a little difficult to
05:57
explain this concept sometimes
06:00
to koreans and in fact i appreciate the
06:03
korean system
06:05
more than i do the american system when
06:07
i was in america of course i
06:09
you have a savings account and you have
06:11
a checking account
06:13
they're different it might be the same
06:14
bank but your savings account
06:17
that's just money you put in there and
06:18
you don't take the money out you just
06:20
get interest
06:20
but then you have a checking account you
06:23
open a checking account you put money in
06:25
there
06:25
and the bank the bank doesn't give you
06:27
checks the bank
06:28
makes you buy a checkbook with checks in
06:31
it
06:32
that's another way they make money
06:34
anyway that's american banks
06:36
and then when you go to the store right
06:38
you go to the store and you want to buy
06:39
something
06:40
now you can use money right just paper
06:42
money
06:43
and just give them the money or you can
06:45
use a check
06:46
or you can use a credit card so you're
06:48
going to pay by cash
06:50
by check or by credit by cash
06:55
by cheque or by credit those are three
06:59
different ways
07:00
to pay at a store or restaurant when you
07:03
want to buy something
07:04
now a check of course is a piece of
07:06
paper like this
07:08
it's in a book that you tear off you
07:10
might have 50 or 100 checks in your book
07:13
and it's a piece of paper that orders a
07:16
bank
07:17
to pay money from a checking account now
07:19
let me show you how the check works here
07:22
up here you put the date so you might
07:24
put august
07:25
5th and then of course the year 2020
07:28
and then you say here it says pay to the
07:30
order of and you write the name of the
07:31
restaurant
07:32
so let's say abc restaurant abc
07:37
restaurant and then
07:40
here it says how much a thousand dollars
07:42
oh my god what did you eat
07:44
okay i'm just kidding but that's you
07:46
know a thousand dollars right there okay
07:48
so then you have to spell that out for
07:49
some reason they just put thousand
07:51
you should put one and they already
07:54
spelled out thousand one thousand
07:55
dollars
07:56
and then here that's optional you can
07:59
say uh
08:00
i ate uh 100 big macs
08:03
right big macs i was really hungry
08:07
okay and then you sign right you just
08:09
sign your name
08:10
on this part here now what happens is
08:12
you give that
08:13
check to the to the restaurant owner and
08:16
the restaurant owner takes those checks
08:18
you know they get maybe many checks from
08:20
many different customers
08:21
they go to the bank and they put those
08:24
checks into their bank account
08:25
now their bank might be abc bank and
08:28
your bank is xyz bank
08:30
so they put their check in the abc bank
08:33
abc bank
08:34
sends the checks to your bank a xyz bank
08:38
and xyz bank takes the money out of your
08:40
checking account
08:41
and sends it to the restaurant owner's
08:44
uh bank account it's very complicated
08:47
okay
08:48
but that's how many americans will pay
08:50
for things
08:51
now paying by check is a little
08:54
old-fashioned these days
08:56
many americans still use checks checks
08:58
are still very common in america
09:00
but people are moving away from checks
09:02
and they're doing internet banking or
09:04
wire transfers in korea of course you do
09:08
a lot of wire transfers
09:10
or internet banking i like the korean
09:12
system much better
09:14
checks are old-fashioned okay
09:17
hopefully korea will never use
09:20
checks okay it's much simpler just to
09:22
have one bank account
09:24
and don't worry about checks and just
09:26
have internet banking on your phone
09:28
or just transfer money at an atm
09:31
okay but checks are a little bit
09:34
complicated
09:34
but they're mostly in america and other
09:37
countries will use them as well
09:38
i'm familiar with the american system
09:40
because i did use checks
09:42
when i was younger when i moved to korea
09:44
no checks
09:46
much easier count yourself lucky okay
09:48
okay
09:50
next bill what is a bill
09:54
a bill is a piece of paper
09:57
listing costs that you should pay for
10:02
using goods or services well
10:05
of course um you should pay your bills
10:09
with money obviously but a bill let's
10:11
say you go to the grocery store
10:13
that's what this is looks like they went
10:14
to the grocery store and they bought
10:15
raspberries and raspberries
10:17
what is it two 299. so they bought
10:20
raspberries
10:21
raspberries are 2.99 and they also
10:24
bought
10:25
uh oh it looks like italian parmesan
10:28
cheese
10:29
and that was two dollars and seven cents
10:31
though so the bill lists
10:32
everything that they bought if you go to
10:35
a restaurant
10:36
again using the restaurant example you
10:38
buy
10:39
a meal but you might buy a salad too and
10:42
a drink
10:43
all of those items are listed on the
10:45
bill and the total
10:46
is on the bottom of the bill the total
10:49
is how much
10:50
you should pay and usually they also add
10:53
tax
10:54
to that so that is the bill
10:58
and bills are just statements saying how
11:01
much you
11:01
owe a person or a company because you
11:05
used their goods or services
11:08
okay that is a bill
11:12
credit card i mentioned this before of
11:14
course that's one of the ways to pay
11:15
people
11:16
for using their goods or services you
11:18
can pay cash you can pay by check
11:20
you can pay by credit card of course
11:23
many people just say buy credit
11:25
they don't say card but that's okay a
11:27
credit card is a plastic card that you
11:29
can use
11:30
instead of cash it's very convenient
11:32
it's much better than using a check
11:34
just give them your card and it
11:36
automatically takes
11:38
the money out of your bank account well
11:40
that's a debit card
11:41
credit card oh with when you use a
11:44
credit card
11:45
that's a good difference there's a
11:46
credit card there's a debit card
11:48
a debit card it just automatically comes
11:51
out of your bank account
11:52
with a credit card at the end of the
11:54
month you get a bill
11:56
the credit card company will send you a
11:58
bill say okay
12:00
uh you charged you used your credit card
12:02
at this store you used your credit card
12:04
at this restaurant
12:05
two days later every day and the amount
12:08
the money that you that you used at each
12:11
store
12:11
is listed on your credit card bill and
12:14
at the end of the month
12:15
you pay that bill so that's another
12:18
example of a bill
12:21
savings account we talked about savings
12:23
account right that's the money
12:25
if you put money into a bank you put in
12:27
your savings account
12:29
it's a bank account that earns interest
12:32
usually again in america savings
12:33
accounts
12:34
give you more interest than a checking
12:36
account i'm not sure if checking
12:38
accounts give you interest
12:39
or not there's that's just money that
12:41
you use for your checking account
12:43
but savings accounts usually give you
12:45
more
12:46
money in interest
12:49
checking account is the next checking
12:51
account a bank account
12:53
which you can take money out of at any
12:55
time
12:56
using your checkbook or cash card cash
12:58
card
12:59
i said debit card it's also called
13:02
debit card cash card so uh
13:06
and again that's the american system
13:08
right they have two different types of
13:09
accounts they have a savings account and
13:11
a checking account you have to have two
13:13
different accounts you have to keep two
13:14
different
13:15
separate uh amounts of money in the bank
13:18
you don't have to have a savings account
13:20
you could just have a checking account
13:22
but you won't earn any interest on it or
13:23
not very much interest on it
13:25
thankfully in many other countries like
13:27
in korea you just have
13:29
one account and you can tie your credit
13:31
card to it
13:32
you can tie your cash card or debit card
13:34
to it you don't worry about checks
13:36
and you also earn interest on it so it's
13:39
a savings account but it's also an
13:41
account where you can actually use that
13:43
money
13:44
with a card or just withdrawing or wire
13:47
transferring money
13:48
so that's it the difference of course in
13:50
america you have the difference between
13:52
savings account
13:53
and a checking account okay good
13:56
so those are our words for the
13:57
vocabulary
14:01
let's talk about the first main idea
14:02
here and that is about saving
14:04
and spending money how do people save
14:06
money how do people
14:08
spend money over here we have some
14:10
examples
14:11
of how people save money and over on the
14:14
right side
14:16
we have some examples of how people
14:18
spend money
14:19
of course money is very important in our
14:21
society we it's very convenient to be
14:23
able to exchange
14:25
or use goods and services so
14:28
how do you save money you can open a
14:31
savings account
14:32
at the bank that's one way to save money
14:34
uh people deposit
14:36
deposit they put their money another way
14:39
to say deposit is
14:40
put money in the bank that's to deposit
14:44
people deposit their money in their
14:46
savings accounts
14:47
and the bank adds interest to the
14:50
accounts
14:51
in return if you save your money with
14:54
our bank
14:55
we will give you interest in return so
14:57
you
14:58
give them your money they're giving you
15:00
some money back
15:01
it's it's kind of like a service right
15:03
you're choosing the bank to manage your
15:05
money
15:06
and as in return they give you interest
15:09
for trusting them or using them for
15:12
uh keeping your money okay so that's how
15:16
you save money
15:17
open a bank account it's a good idea
15:19
even if you're young
15:20
it's probably never too early
15:23
to open a bank account in your name
15:26
start saving money
15:27
it's very important for your life okay
15:30
spending money now of course we need to
15:32
spend money don't spend all your money
15:33
of course
15:34
be wise choose wisely when you spend
15:37
your money
15:37
but how do people spend money well of
15:40
course
15:41
this person here is a customer and she
15:43
is going to
15:44
pay with a check at a restaurant so
15:47
she's giving
15:48
the waiter a check now of course she can
15:51
pay the bill
15:52
right this is the bill here the waiter
15:54
is giving the customer bill and she's
15:56
giving
15:56
the waiter some form of payment this
15:58
could be cash it could be credit card
16:00
it could be a check in this case we're
16:02
talking about a check
16:04
so she gives the waiter a check the
16:06
restaurant
16:08
sends the check to the customer's bank
16:10
we talked about this before
16:12
the bank takes the money from the
16:14
customer's checking account
16:16
and sends it to the restaurant's banking
16:19
account and that's how the the the money
16:22
is finally transferred
16:24
so you see checking is is more difficult
16:27
a checking account is more difficult
16:29
that system is more difficult
16:31
it adds another step in the process
16:34
and it's it's getting it's really an
16:36
old-fashioned way
16:38
of transferring money from one person to
16:40
another
16:42
thankfully many countries don't use
16:45
checking accounts
16:46
unfortunately americans still use
16:48
checking accounts quite often
16:50
they may not realize how inconvenient it
16:52
is compared to other systems
16:54
but as an american myself i can tell you
16:57
it's much easier in korea
16:59
to don't worry about a checking account
17:01
just use a debit card
17:03
a credit card or just transfer money
17:06
from one account to the other
17:07
so anyway that is how people will save
17:10
money and that is how people will
17:12
spend money
17:15
another idea in this unit why people
17:18
save money and i encourage you
17:21
i encourage you to save money even if
17:23
you don't have a bank account
17:25
maybe you have a piggy bank right a
17:27
little pig with
17:28
with a slot in the top you can put bills
17:31
in there you can also put coins in there
17:33
save it up okay and you can use it in
17:36
the future
17:38
so why do people save money well maybe
17:40
they want to buy a new bicycle right
17:42
that's a good reason
17:43
you can save your money to buy something
17:46
big later on a bicycle is expensive
17:49
you don't have enough money now but if
17:52
you save your money over time
17:53
then you can buy something more
17:55
expensive later on that you really want
17:57
or that you really need now it's also
18:00
important to go to college
18:02
college costs a lot of money so people
18:05
need to save money
18:06
probably your mom or your dad has an
18:10
account
18:10
at a bank that's for your college
18:13
spending
18:14
many parents do this they save money for
18:16
their children to go to college
18:18
because college is expensive they don't
18:20
have all the money right away
18:22
so every month they put a little bit of
18:24
money aside and after a long time
18:26
as you grow up that money gets bigger
18:28
and bigger and then you can go to
18:30
college on that money
18:32
you can also save for your own college
18:34
as well
18:35
a little bit and help your mom and dad
18:38
some people save money
18:39
to go abroad that means to travel to
18:42
another country
18:43
and that's also very uh good use of
18:46
money because it's always good to travel
18:48
and experience new cultures new
18:50
languages new ways of thinking
18:52
traveling abroad is always a good idea
18:55
and ex
18:56
be careful where you go of course but uh
18:58
uh you know go there to learn about new
19:00
people
19:00
new customs new languages very
19:03
interesting it's
19:04
it's educational as well so people will
19:07
will save money to buy or to
19:10
purchase expensive things in the future
19:14
whether it's a new bicycle a college
19:16
education
19:17
or a trip abroad so people save money
19:21
to buy goods and services in the future
19:24
that's the main reason why people
19:26
will save money so it's a good idea if
19:29
you want something
19:30
big in the future start saving now
19:33
okay okay let's take a look at the
19:36
reading passage
19:37
as usual i will read it out loud you
19:40
guys repeat it after me either out loud
19:42
or
19:42
in your mind focus on the vocabulary
19:45
words
19:46
and of course focus on pronunciation for
19:48
all the words
19:49
especially the more difficult ones are
19:51
you guys ready
19:52
let's begin we all
19:55
need to spend and save
19:59
money using a bank is the usual way
20:04
that people save their money
20:08
each week my parents give me five
20:11
dollars i keep three dollars
20:15
and i deposit two dollars
20:18
in my savings account
20:21
in return the bank gives me interest
20:25
so that my two dollars grows into
20:28
more money
20:31
that is why people save money in a bank
20:35
my parents also deposit money in a bank
20:39
my dad writes a check to pay bills
20:43
for things like electricity and gas the
20:48
money
20:48
is taken out of the checking account
20:52
each month
20:56
my parents also have a credit card
21:00
they use this to pay for expensive
21:03
things
21:03
like cars or tvs
21:07
when i get older i will also use a
21:11
checking account
21:12
and a credit card to spend my money
21:16
okay let's go over how this information
21:19
was organized
21:20
in the reading passage here we have
21:23
cause
21:23
on the left side and effect on the right
21:26
side
21:27
cause is an action you do an action and
21:29
there is a result
21:31
the result is the effect of that action
21:34
we have two actions here one
21:36
and two and then of course we have two
21:38
results or two effects
21:40
of those actions so what's the first
21:43
action let's go over these
21:44
each week my parents give me five
21:47
dollars
21:48
right great i beep two dollars
21:51
in my savings account so what does the
21:54
person do the person who's writing this
21:56
reading passage
21:57
they when they take money
22:00
and they deposit into their savings
22:04
account so they deposit we use the word
22:06
deposit
22:07
now of course you could also use put
22:11
put is a broad verb it has
22:14
many meanings for many different
22:16
situations you put your
22:18
toys in a box you put your clothes
22:21
in the closet but when we're talking
22:23
about putting money in a bank
22:24
that is a specific idea we use a more
22:28
specific verb
22:30
deposit you deposit the money into the
22:33
bank of course you can say i put the
22:34
money in the bank
22:35
but deposit is especially specifically
22:39
used for putting money into a bank so
22:42
you deposit two dollars
22:43
into your savings account what happens
22:47
as a result of that the bank gives me
22:50
what the bank gives me they'll give me a
22:52
little bit of money back and we call
22:54
that interest interest
22:58
the bank gives me interest there we go
23:01
the bank gives me interest on the money
23:03
in my
23:04
savings account okay good that's the
23:07
first cause and effect
23:09
the second cause and effect my dad
23:11
writes what he well he writes a check
23:13
right we talked about that in the
23:15
vocabulary and i wrote one for you as an
23:17
example
23:18
so your dad writes a check why does he
23:20
write a check because
23:21
every month he gets many what's
23:24
right of course in your household you
23:27
use electricity you use
23:28
gas you might of course you use water
23:31
and maybe other services in your
23:33
neighborhood or in your town
23:36
and the companies that are providing
23:38
these services will send you
23:40
a written statement listing those
23:42
services and how much they cost
23:44
of course we talked about those and so
23:47
uh
23:47
every month your mom and dad have to pay
23:50
bills
23:51
so your dad might write a check right
23:54
what is the result of that
23:56
well the money that is taken out of the
23:59
what again this is an american situation
24:02
you have a savings account
24:04
and you have a checking account so the
24:07
money is taken out of the checking
24:08
account
24:12
it's two words actually
24:15
checking account each month okay so and
24:18
i know this can be
24:19
sometimes confusing to people who are
24:22
who don't
24:23
uh use banking systems like the american
24:26
system
24:26
uh don't worry about it uh you know if
24:29
you're in america you have to open a
24:30
checking account and you will have to
24:32
learn
24:32
what is a checking account and how to
24:34
use it if you're
24:36
in many other countries that don't have
24:38
a checking account
24:39
be happy you are lucky you don't have to
24:41
deal with that system which is kind of
24:43
old-fashioned
24:44
and kind of difficult to deal with
24:47
it's much easier of course just to use a
24:50
debit card a credit card
24:51
or cash or just to wire money okay so
24:55
that is our lesson for today it's a good
24:58
lesson though because
24:59
it's very important to start thinking
25:00
about money
25:02
how much will you save are there
25:04
purchases are there things you want to
25:06
buy in your future
25:07
that cost a lot of money you have to
25:09
start
25:10
saving your money and a good place to
25:11
save your money
25:13
is in a bank because they will give you
25:15
interest
25:16
if you need to save money for a very
25:18
long period of time
25:19
then put your money in the bank and they
25:21
will give you interest
25:23
on your money so you're like making
25:25
money for not doing anything
25:27
just putting the money in the bank so
25:29
that's a good idea
25:30
of course when you get older and of
25:32
course now you spend money and there are
25:33
many different
25:34
ways to spend money we went over a few
25:37
of those
25:38
in this lesson okay well thanks for
25:40
studying with me as always
25:42
i hope you learned some useful words and
25:45
some
25:45
useful ideas about life okay
25:48
take it easy everybody we'll see in the
25:50
