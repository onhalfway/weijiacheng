hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading i'm brian stewart and in this
lesson
we're going over science book 3 lesson
12 changing matter
now before we talked about matter what
matter is
but now we want to talk about how matter
changes
and in this unit we will discover how
matter can change
and what are the common forms of
matter so interesting lesson let's begin
okay we always begin with a vocabulary
section so let's learn some new words or
maybe go over words you already know
that will be used in the lesson and in
the reading section the first word
is stir to stir
means to mix liquids or solids together
you probably stir many times in your
life
already sometimes your drink let's say
you have a drink and it's
tea and the tea you taste it oh it's too
bitter so you want to change the taste
you might take some sugar
put the sugar in the tea don't put too
much sugar in the tea that's what my
wife always tells me anyway
put some sugar in the tea and then use a
spoon and you stir it
because if you don't stir it the sugar
just goes to the bottom the tea and
stays there
you don't want that you want the sugar
to mix with the liquid
so that everything is sweet not just the
bottom part
so you stir the sugar and what happens
the sugar will
mix with the liquid so the sugar is a
solid and the t is a liquid
and i should say at this point that we
have liquids we have
solids those are two forms of matter
what's the third form of matter we have
liquid solid
and gas
so matter can have three different
forms it can be a gas it can be a liquid
or it can be a solid and the difference
between them
is the temperature usually
if a matter is solid that's the coolest
temperature
then it gets warmer it becomes a liquid
then it gets even warmer
it may become a gas sometimes not
you have to have very extreme
temperatures for some things
okay stir but stir you know i went off
on stir
stir is when you're mixing liquids and
solids so that they become
a liquid they're all liquid the solid
dissolves
we'll talk about that anyway we do have
a video for stir
and this is a good picture or video for
stirring
you can see this is probably in a
factory and they're mixing something
what are they mixing
it could be i'm not really sure what
what they're mixing there
it reminds me though my brother-in-law
works for a
beer factory and they probably have many
of these types of machines
to mix the different ingredients to make
the beer
but it will just stir it and it's a
machine because nobody wants to sit
there with a hand
and do this for an hour right but a
machine a stirrer
will do it for you so to stir all
things together next we have dissolve
and i mentioned this already
that's when you mix a solid into a
liquid
for example the sugar is a solid you
stir it
in the tea the liquid and the result
is that the solid disappears right that
sugar disappears
what happened to it it's still there but
it dissolved
it dissolved into the t
so the solid became part of the liquid
okay that's that some things will do
that
not everything of course but some things
will do that
a physical change a physical change is a
change in matter
where no new matter is made
and so what's an example of that of
course we just went over that
again when you mix sugar into tea or you
mix salt
into water no new matter you're not
making
any new type of matter or new type of
substance the original
things the original matter is still
there the sugar
is in your tea you just can't see it but
you can taste it
there's no new matter made it's but it's
been changed
from a solid into a liquid and the t has
changed too because it's now
part you know it's got the sugar in it
so it's a physical change
okay a change in matter where no new
matter is made
evaporate evaporate is another type of a
physical change because let's say we
have that tea right we have the sugar
now let's say we heat up the tea so we
want to change the liquid to a gas
right we just talked about that as
temperatures get hotter
liquids will turn into a gas so if you
boil the tea
right the the tea the water in the tea
will evaporate it will come into the air
and disappear
and at the bottom you have the sugar
crystals
at the bottom sugar's still there right
so there was no change in the matter
no new matter was made it's all still
there it's just a physical change
so dissolve and evaporate are both
physical changes
they're different types of physical
changes
so but evaporate is when a liquid goes
from being a liquid
to a gas and you see it every day when
your mom
or your dad boils water on the stove
to make pasta or to make noodles
ramyan you boil water and the water
you see the steam above the water that
means the water is changing into a gas
the water is evaporating don't boil the
water too long
because all the water will evaporate
right and you'll have a problem
whatever you're cooking will burn you
don't want that
so be careful but when you do that
okay next we have rust now
rust is a different kind of change
rust means when a metal changes
into new red or brown matter new matter
is created so it's not a physical change
it's a different kind of change
we'll talk about that um but when a
metal
is left out so imagine you have some
metal parts if you have a metal toy and
you leave it outside and it rains and
it's outside for a couple months
you you like where's my toy and you go
out you look at it and your metal toy is
now
changed into red or brown color
and maybe some stuff powder comes off of
it
and it's not as good or as shiny as it
used to be
that means that it has rusted okay
so be careful with your metal things
that you have a bicycle
uh a toy don't leave it outside in the
rain because especially water and wind
air
will make that metal rust
okay some types of metal do not rust
stainless steel
doesn't rust okay but other many other
types of metal will rust
now rust as i said is not a
physical change it is a chemical change
a chemical change is a change in matter
where new matter new matter is
made so i just gave the example of the
metal right
the metal changes into it changes color
red or brown and it's a new powder right
this it's that's not metal that's a new
matter
another good example is in the picture
here right if you have a match
right this is a certain type of matter
but if you light the match
and there's a flame right i'm not a very
good artist
a flame that's maybe better what happens
it turns black and
the wood changes form now this
isn't wood this is ash it's
carbon right the chemical property
of the wood and this part here the
matchhead
changes into new matter that is what we
call
a chemical change chemical change where
new matter
is made okay so we saw two different
types
of changes in matter
okay those are our words for today
now let's go over the two main ideas for
this lesson and we already kind of
touched upon these in the vocabulary
section
we talked about physical change and we
talked about
chemical change remember in a physical
change
no new matter is made so what kinds of
physical changes
are there well of course there's cutting
right when you cut
paper or you cut colored paper to make
some interesting designs or some
artwork you're cutting the paper you're
changing the
shape or the physical properties of the
paper but you're not making any new
material
it's still paper right but it's just
changed in its form or its size
so cutting is a type of physical change
so is folding
right you have a flat sheet of paper and
you fold it and some people can
fold and make very interesting shapes
with the paper but
no new paper is made nothing new is
being made
you're just changing the existing paper
and again the same thing for tearing
tearing is like
cutting but tearing is not as
neat or as precise or as controlled
as cutting cutting is very controlled
and you can control the
the cut very easily but when you tear
something you don't really control it
the tear goes
anywhere so that's the difference
between cut and tear tear is just you
rip
paper apart and it just tears off so
again in these types of
methods for changing matter no new
material
is made however on the bottom for
chemical change
new matter is made we gave the example
of the match
it burns so what the paper
changes the paper changes into black
substance here we call that carbon it's
also ash and smoke
smoke is a gas right the smoke of the
fire is the paper changing because of
the heat
that is a chemical change again
heat like i said before heat will change
the the the matter into something new
and it looks like an example here the
eggs there's still eggs
but the physical properties of the eggs
they will change
and you might get some new
matter when you cook eggs especially if
you cook
eggs too long they'll turn black and be
burnt so be careful when you heat
foods and of course we saw the example
before when we were looking at the
vocabulary
what does rust mean rust is when metal
is left outside
exposed to rain usually rain humid water
moisture
and air oxygen it the
the metal will rust it will change like
this and it will make this
brown or red material and if you touch
it it's like a powder and it falls off
the metal
if you leave metal out long enough the
nails or whatever this is
they will rust away the metal will
disappear it will completely change
and that's not good obviously you don't
want that to happen
okay so those are two ways of changing
matter
now as i said before matter can have
three main forms and we talked about
those first we have
solid then as the temperature increases
it becomes a liquid and then the
temperature
keeps going up it becomes a gas
so these are our three main types of
matter
or three main states of matter changes
of state
will occur and we talked about some of
these already
so freezing again like i said as the
temperature goes up this is temperature
temperature as the temperature goes up
solids turn into liquids liquids turn
into gas but
it also happens the other way as the
temperature goes down
so if we have a liquid
it changes into a solid that's what we
call freezing
so of course the common example is water
water is normally a liquid if you have
water at room temperature
in your uh in your bedroom or in your
kitchen or in your living
in your house you have water that's not
in the freezer right that's just water
you drink it it's a liquid
but if you put it in the freezer you
lower the temperature what happens to
the water
it becomes a solid it freezes and it
changes from a liquid to a solid
in this case it changes to ice
okay ice now if the temperature
increases
that solid ice will change into a liquid
and we call that process
melting so of course if you have ice on
a hot summer day
and you drink all the water and it's
just ice left in the cup you put it on
your desk
and it's a hot day that that ice will
slowly melt
into liquid we call that melting same
thing will happen to an ice cream cone
so if you're eating ice cream eat it
quick not too quickly but eat it quickly
enough so it doesn't melt all over your
hand right
okay so melting to change from a solid
to a liquid
now evaporating we already talked about
that that is when a liquid
turns into a gas and we saw the example
with the water on the stove
if you heat up the water to boil
something you want to make pasta noodles
whatever
the water will start to bubble right
because the heat makes it
there's a lot of energy in the water and
it starts to bubble and what's going on
is that liquid
is forming into gas and the gas is
escaping into the air
it's still water it's just moisture
in the air instead of liquid in your pot
so to change from a liquid to a gas
and go into the air it kind of you know
it's hot
it kind of merges with the air it gets
in the air and it becomes part of the
air
of course there's a lot of water in the
air right now there's some
very small particles of moisture
floating around
right now and they go up in the sky it
becomes cold they turn into liquid
what happens it falls as rain or snow
depending on the uh
on the temperature now condensing is an
interesting word or an interesting
changes of state that means it changes
from a gas
to a liquid remember a gas is very hot
but when a gas becomes
cool it turns into a liquid so again
think about your cup of ice water right
you put it on your desk
now you may notice that after a few
minutes
water will form on the outside of the
cup
how did water get from inside the cup to
outside the cup
that didn't happen remember i just said
there's water in the air around you
especially on a humid day there's
there's more water now if
if that gas the air comes into contact
with a cold surface
what happens well the water in the air
cools down it changes from a gas
to a liquid and those are the drops of
water you find
on the outside of your cup right it also
happens on the outside of your car
right in the morning right it gets very
cold
that air the the moisture in the air
will collect on your car
your dad will go out say what did it
rain last night it didn't rain
it was just the dew we call that dew in
the morning
that gets on your car and that's the it
comes out of the air
and it cools down and it drops onto your
car on the ground it's also on the grass
it's all over the place we call that dew
and that's because
condensing or condensation condensation
is the noun condensation
condensation ion it's a noun so that is
condensation when gas cools down
and forms a liquid that's condensation
so it's
the condensing okay those are some
important ideas we'll take a look at
those ideas
in the reading passage
okay here we have the reading passage as
usual
you can read along with me or read along
silently in your mind
let's focus on the pronunciation and on
the words we just
learned are you ready let's begin
matter can change if you cut
paper into pieces it looks different
but each piece of paper is still
paper this is a physical change
a physical change means the matter has
changed from what it looked like
but it is still the same matter
matter sorry if you stir
salt into water the salt will dissolve
you cannot see it anymore
salt dissolving in water is a
physical change the salt is still there
but now it's a liquid it's mixed with
the water you can't see it
okay when all the water
evaporates the salt will be
all that is left you can separate
salt from water this way
if you burn paper smoke and ash
are made smoke and ash are not paper
this is a chemical change a chemical
change
means new matter is made
the metal iron can rust
rusting is a chemical change
parts of iron very small parts parts of
iron change into new matter
which is not iron
okay that's the reading passage
now let's talk about how the reading or
the information the reading
passage was organized what is the
reading skill here we have
classify we classifies to separate into
different groups
and in this passage we talked about two
different groups
of how matter can change right we talked
about physical change
and we talked about chemical change okay
so first we have physical change
in physical change matter has changed
and looks different
but it is still the same matter this is
called
beep okay what is the beat this is
called a
physical change kind of interesting
physical change
oh oh my gosh it's over here
physical change p h y s
i c a l change so it's kind of odd that
you know it's the same thing really it
is still the same matter this is called
a physical change
salt can do what what do we talk about
we talked about different types of
changing or different
ways methods for changing salt can
dissolve in water dissolve dissolve
salt can dissolve in water
and what else what's the opposite of
dissolve
water can what evaporate
evaporate
so what we have here in our reading
skill is we have
one type of change that's a classifier
we say one type of change is physical
change
and then we have details of physical
change right first we have
we say we define what is physical change
and then we give one detail
dissolve is a type of physical change
and evaporate
is a type of physical change so we have
uh the group
what is it and what are two details
that's how this information is
organized it's a good way to organize
information in a reading passage
and the same thing happens for chemical
change so first we have chemical change
right
new matter is made this is called a
chemical change
so first we define what it is it's a
chemical
change oops this pen
yeah okay there we go so new matter is
made this is called a
chemical change so first we define it
new matter is made
that is what we call a chemical change
now what's a type of chemical
change the metal iron can remember when
the metal iron changes into a red or
brown material
we call that rust and
new matter is made okay so
this is a good way to organize your
information and reading passage
you know you might classify it you know
this group this group
define what is this group and then give
examples
then define what is the other group and
then give examples
that's a very good way to organize your
information in a reading
passage okay well this in this lesson
was kind of interesting
we saw how matter changes remember
matter can have three forms
gas liquid or solid and those forms
change
depending on the temperature and we cut
we have different
words for the types of changes that
occur
for example dissolve evaporate condense
so matter is actually always changing
form around us right water is changing
into a gas and then it changes back to a
liquid it rains on us
or it may change into a solid and come
down as snow
or ice hopefully it doesn't come down as
ice that's hail
but it can happen so matter is always
changing around us depending on the
temperature
and also depending on what processes or
what
what's happened what kind of forces are
being put
onto the matter so that's very
interesting to think about
nothing is permanent everything changes
but hopefully things are permanent long
enough so that you can enjoy them
okay so anyway there's an interesting
lesson today i hope you learned a lot
some new vocabulary some new ideas some
new ways of looking at the world around
you
i hope to see you in the next lesson
take care everybody bye bye

hello everybody
00:09
welcome back to american textbook
00:11
reading i'm brian stewart and in this
00:13
lesson
00:13
we're going over science book 3 lesson
00:17
12 changing matter
00:20
now before we talked about matter what
00:22
matter is
00:23
but now we want to talk about how matter
00:26
changes
00:27
and in this unit we will discover how
00:29
matter can change
00:31
and what are the common forms of
00:34
matter so interesting lesson let's begin
00:42
okay we always begin with a vocabulary
00:44
section so let's learn some new words or
00:46
maybe go over words you already know
00:48
that will be used in the lesson and in
00:51
the reading section the first word
00:53
is stir to stir
00:56
means to mix liquids or solids together
01:00
you probably stir many times in your
01:03
life
01:03
already sometimes your drink let's say
01:06
you have a drink and it's
01:07
tea and the tea you taste it oh it's too
01:10
bitter so you want to change the taste
01:13
you might take some sugar
01:15
put the sugar in the tea don't put too
01:16
much sugar in the tea that's what my
01:18
wife always tells me anyway
01:20
put some sugar in the tea and then use a
01:22
spoon and you stir it
01:24
because if you don't stir it the sugar
01:26
just goes to the bottom the tea and
01:28
stays there
01:28
you don't want that you want the sugar
01:30
to mix with the liquid
01:32
so that everything is sweet not just the
01:34
bottom part
01:35
so you stir the sugar and what happens
01:38
the sugar will
01:40
mix with the liquid so the sugar is a
01:43
solid and the t is a liquid
01:47
and i should say at this point that we
01:49
have liquids we have
01:51
solids those are two forms of matter
01:54
what's the third form of matter we have
01:56
liquid solid
01:58
and gas
02:01
so matter can have three different
02:05
forms it can be a gas it can be a liquid
02:08
or it can be a solid and the difference
02:11
between them
02:12
is the temperature usually
02:15
if a matter is solid that's the coolest
02:18
temperature
02:19
then it gets warmer it becomes a liquid
02:22
then it gets even warmer
02:23
it may become a gas sometimes not
02:27
you have to have very extreme
02:28
temperatures for some things
02:30
okay stir but stir you know i went off
02:33
on stir
02:34
stir is when you're mixing liquids and
02:35
solids so that they become
02:37
a liquid they're all liquid the solid
02:40
dissolves
02:41
we'll talk about that anyway we do have
02:43
a video for stir
02:44
and this is a good picture or video for
02:47
stirring
02:48
you can see this is probably in a
02:49
factory and they're mixing something
02:51
what are they mixing
02:53
it could be i'm not really sure what
02:55
what they're mixing there
02:56
it reminds me though my brother-in-law
02:58
works for a
02:59
beer factory and they probably have many
03:02
of these types of machines
03:04
to mix the different ingredients to make
03:06
the beer
03:07
but it will just stir it and it's a
03:09
machine because nobody wants to sit
03:11
there with a hand
03:12
and do this for an hour right but a
03:14
machine a stirrer
03:16
will do it for you so to stir all
03:19
things together next we have dissolve
03:22
and i mentioned this already
03:24
that's when you mix a solid into a
03:26
liquid
03:27
for example the sugar is a solid you
03:30
stir it
03:31
in the tea the liquid and the result
03:34
is that the solid disappears right that
03:36
sugar disappears
03:37
what happened to it it's still there but
03:40
it dissolved
03:42
it dissolved into the t
03:46
so the solid became part of the liquid
03:50
okay that's that some things will do
03:52
that
03:53
not everything of course but some things
03:55
will do that
03:58
a physical change a physical change is a
04:01
change in matter
04:02
where no new matter is made
04:06
and so what's an example of that of
04:08
course we just went over that
04:10
again when you mix sugar into tea or you
04:13
mix salt
04:14
into water no new matter you're not
04:17
making
04:18
any new type of matter or new type of
04:21
substance the original
04:24
things the original matter is still
04:26
there the sugar
04:27
is in your tea you just can't see it but
04:30
you can taste it
04:32
there's no new matter made it's but it's
04:35
been changed
04:36
from a solid into a liquid and the t has
04:39
changed too because it's now
04:41
part you know it's got the sugar in it
04:43
so it's a physical change
04:45
okay a change in matter where no new
04:48
matter is made
04:51
evaporate evaporate is another type of a
04:54
physical change because let's say we
04:57
have that tea right we have the sugar
04:59
now let's say we heat up the tea so we
05:02
want to change the liquid to a gas
05:04
right we just talked about that as
05:06
temperatures get hotter
05:07
liquids will turn into a gas so if you
05:11
boil the tea
05:12
right the the tea the water in the tea
05:15
will evaporate it will come into the air
05:18
and disappear
05:19
and at the bottom you have the sugar
05:22
crystals
05:22
at the bottom sugar's still there right
05:24
so there was no change in the matter
05:27
no new matter was made it's all still
05:29
there it's just a physical change
05:31
so dissolve and evaporate are both
05:34
physical changes
05:35
they're different types of physical
05:38
changes
05:38
so but evaporate is when a liquid goes
05:41
from being a liquid
05:42
to a gas and you see it every day when
05:45
your mom
05:45
or your dad boils water on the stove
05:49
to make pasta or to make noodles
05:52
ramyan you boil water and the water
05:56
you see the steam above the water that
05:59
means the water is changing into a gas
06:01
the water is evaporating don't boil the
06:04
water too long
06:05
because all the water will evaporate
06:07
right and you'll have a problem
06:09
whatever you're cooking will burn you
06:12
don't want that
06:12
so be careful but when you do that
06:16
okay next we have rust now
06:19
rust is a different kind of change
06:23
rust means when a metal changes
06:26
into new red or brown matter new matter
06:30
is created so it's not a physical change
06:32
it's a different kind of change
06:34
we'll talk about that um but when a
06:37
metal
06:37
is left out so imagine you have some
06:41
metal parts if you have a metal toy and
06:43
you leave it outside and it rains and
06:45
it's outside for a couple months
06:47
you you like where's my toy and you go
06:49
out you look at it and your metal toy is
06:51
now
06:51
changed into red or brown color
06:54
and maybe some stuff powder comes off of
06:58
it
06:58
and it's not as good or as shiny as it
07:01
used to be
07:02
that means that it has rusted okay
07:05
so be careful with your metal things
07:08
that you have a bicycle
07:10
uh a toy don't leave it outside in the
07:13
rain because especially water and wind
07:15
air
07:16
will make that metal rust
07:20
okay some types of metal do not rust
07:22
stainless steel
07:23
doesn't rust okay but other many other
07:26
types of metal will rust
07:30
now rust as i said is not a
07:33
physical change it is a chemical change
07:37
a chemical change is a change in matter
07:40
where new matter new matter is
07:43
made so i just gave the example of the
07:45
metal right
07:46
the metal changes into it changes color
07:50
red or brown and it's a new powder right
07:52
this it's that's not metal that's a new
07:55
matter
07:55
another good example is in the picture
07:57
here right if you have a match
07:59
right this is a certain type of matter
08:02
but if you light the match
08:04
and there's a flame right i'm not a very
08:06
good artist
08:07
a flame that's maybe better what happens
08:10
it turns black and
08:12
the wood changes form now this
08:15
isn't wood this is ash it's
08:19
carbon right the chemical property
08:22
of the wood and this part here the
08:25
matchhead
08:26
changes into new matter that is what we
08:29
call
08:30
a chemical change chemical change where
08:32
new matter
08:33
is made okay so we saw two different
08:37
types
08:37
of changes in matter
08:40
okay those are our words for today
08:45
now let's go over the two main ideas for
08:47
this lesson and we already kind of
08:49
touched upon these in the vocabulary
08:50
section
08:51
we talked about physical change and we
08:54
talked about
08:54
chemical change remember in a physical
08:57
change
08:57
no new matter is made so what kinds of
09:01
physical changes
09:02
are there well of course there's cutting
09:05
right when you cut
09:06
paper or you cut colored paper to make
09:08
some interesting designs or some
09:10
artwork you're cutting the paper you're
09:13
changing the
09:14
shape or the physical properties of the
09:16
paper but you're not making any new
09:18
material
09:19
it's still paper right but it's just
09:22
changed in its form or its size
09:24
so cutting is a type of physical change
09:27
so is folding
09:28
right you have a flat sheet of paper and
09:30
you fold it and some people can
09:32
fold and make very interesting shapes
09:34
with the paper but
09:36
no new paper is made nothing new is
09:38
being made
09:39
you're just changing the existing paper
09:43
and again the same thing for tearing
09:45
tearing is like
09:47
cutting but tearing is not as
09:50
neat or as precise or as controlled
09:54
as cutting cutting is very controlled
09:57
and you can control the
09:58
the cut very easily but when you tear
10:01
something you don't really control it
10:03
the tear goes
10:03
anywhere so that's the difference
10:05
between cut and tear tear is just you
10:07
rip
10:07
paper apart and it just tears off so
10:11
again in these types of
10:14
methods for changing matter no new
10:17
material
10:18
is made however on the bottom for
10:21
chemical change
10:22
new matter is made we gave the example
10:24
of the match
10:25
it burns so what the paper
10:28
changes the paper changes into black
10:32
substance here we call that carbon it's
10:34
also ash and smoke
10:36
smoke is a gas right the smoke of the
10:40
fire is the paper changing because of
10:43
the heat
10:44
that is a chemical change again
10:47
heat like i said before heat will change
10:51
the the the matter into something new
10:55
and it looks like an example here the
10:57
eggs there's still eggs
10:59
but the physical properties of the eggs
11:01
they will change
11:03
and you might get some new
11:06
matter when you cook eggs especially if
11:09
you cook
11:09
eggs too long they'll turn black and be
11:12
burnt so be careful when you heat
11:14
foods and of course we saw the example
11:16
before when we were looking at the
11:17
vocabulary
11:18
what does rust mean rust is when metal
11:21
is left outside
11:22
exposed to rain usually rain humid water
11:26
moisture
11:27
and air oxygen it the
11:30
the metal will rust it will change like
11:33
this and it will make this
11:35
brown or red material and if you touch
11:37
it it's like a powder and it falls off
11:39
the metal
11:40
if you leave metal out long enough the
11:42
nails or whatever this is
11:44
they will rust away the metal will
11:46
disappear it will completely change
11:49
and that's not good obviously you don't
11:51
want that to happen
11:52
okay so those are two ways of changing
11:55
matter
11:57
now as i said before matter can have
12:00
three main forms and we talked about
12:02
those first we have
12:03
solid then as the temperature increases
12:06
it becomes a liquid and then the
12:10
temperature
12:10
keeps going up it becomes a gas
12:14
so these are our three main types of
12:17
matter
12:17
or three main states of matter changes
12:20
of state
12:21
will occur and we talked about some of
12:23
these already
12:25
so freezing again like i said as the
12:27
temperature goes up this is temperature
12:31
temperature as the temperature goes up
12:34
solids turn into liquids liquids turn
12:36
into gas but
12:37
it also happens the other way as the
12:39
temperature goes down
12:41
so if we have a liquid
12:44
it changes into a solid that's what we
12:47
call freezing
12:48
so of course the common example is water
12:51
water is normally a liquid if you have
12:54
water at room temperature
12:56
in your uh in your bedroom or in your
12:58
kitchen or in your living
13:00
in your house you have water that's not
13:02
in the freezer right that's just water
13:03
you drink it it's a liquid
13:05
but if you put it in the freezer you
13:06
lower the temperature what happens to
13:08
the water
13:09
it becomes a solid it freezes and it
13:12
changes from a liquid to a solid
13:14
in this case it changes to ice
13:17
okay ice now if the temperature
13:21
increases
13:22
that solid ice will change into a liquid
13:25
and we call that process
13:27
melting so of course if you have ice on
13:30
a hot summer day
13:32
and you drink all the water and it's
13:34
just ice left in the cup you put it on
13:36
your desk
13:37
and it's a hot day that that ice will
13:40
slowly melt
13:41
into liquid we call that melting same
13:44
thing will happen to an ice cream cone
13:46
so if you're eating ice cream eat it
13:47
quick not too quickly but eat it quickly
13:49
enough so it doesn't melt all over your
13:51
hand right
13:52
okay so melting to change from a solid
13:55
to a liquid
13:57
now evaporating we already talked about
13:59
that that is when a liquid
14:01
turns into a gas and we saw the example
14:04
with the water on the stove
14:06
if you heat up the water to boil
14:08
something you want to make pasta noodles
14:10
whatever
14:11
the water will start to bubble right
14:13
because the heat makes it
14:15
there's a lot of energy in the water and
14:17
it starts to bubble and what's going on
14:19
is that liquid
14:20
is forming into gas and the gas is
14:22
escaping into the air
14:24
it's still water it's just moisture
14:27
in the air instead of liquid in your pot
14:31
so to change from a liquid to a gas
14:34
and go into the air it kind of you know
14:37
it's hot
14:37
it kind of merges with the air it gets
14:39
in the air and it becomes part of the
14:41
air
14:42
of course there's a lot of water in the
14:43
air right now there's some
14:45
very small particles of moisture
14:47
floating around
14:48
right now and they go up in the sky it
14:50
becomes cold they turn into liquid
14:52
what happens it falls as rain or snow
14:55
depending on the uh
14:56
on the temperature now condensing is an
15:00
interesting word or an interesting
15:01
changes of state that means it changes
15:04
from a gas
15:05
to a liquid remember a gas is very hot
15:08
but when a gas becomes
15:10
cool it turns into a liquid so again
15:12
think about your cup of ice water right
15:15
you put it on your desk
15:17
now you may notice that after a few
15:20
minutes
15:21
water will form on the outside of the
15:23
cup
15:24
how did water get from inside the cup to
15:27
outside the cup
15:28
that didn't happen remember i just said
15:30
there's water in the air around you
15:33
especially on a humid day there's
15:35
there's more water now if
15:36
if that gas the air comes into contact
15:40
with a cold surface
15:42
what happens well the water in the air
15:44
cools down it changes from a gas
15:46
to a liquid and those are the drops of
15:49
water you find
15:50
on the outside of your cup right it also
15:53
happens on the outside of your car
15:55
right in the morning right it gets very
15:58
cold
15:59
that air the the moisture in the air
16:01
will collect on your car
16:02
your dad will go out say what did it
16:04
rain last night it didn't rain
16:06
it was just the dew we call that dew in
16:09
the morning
16:09
that gets on your car and that's the it
16:12
comes out of the air
16:13
and it cools down and it drops onto your
16:16
car on the ground it's also on the grass
16:18
it's all over the place we call that dew
16:20
and that's because
16:21
condensing or condensation condensation
16:25
is the noun condensation
16:30
condensation ion it's a noun so that is
16:34
condensation when gas cools down
16:38
and forms a liquid that's condensation
16:41
so it's
16:42
the condensing okay those are some
16:45
important ideas we'll take a look at
16:47
those ideas
16:48
in the reading passage
16:52
okay here we have the reading passage as
16:54
usual
16:55
you can read along with me or read along
16:57
silently in your mind
16:59
let's focus on the pronunciation and on
17:01
the words we just
17:02
learned are you ready let's begin
17:06
matter can change if you cut
17:09
paper into pieces it looks different
17:13
but each piece of paper is still
17:16
paper this is a physical change
17:22
a physical change means the matter has
17:25
changed from what it looked like
17:29
but it is still the same matter
17:33
matter sorry if you stir
17:36
salt into water the salt will dissolve
17:41
you cannot see it anymore
17:44
salt dissolving in water is a
17:47
physical change the salt is still there
17:51
but now it's a liquid it's mixed with
17:53
the water you can't see it
17:55
okay when all the water
17:59
evaporates the salt will be
18:02
all that is left you can separate
18:05
salt from water this way
18:11
if you burn paper smoke and ash
18:15
are made smoke and ash are not paper
18:19
this is a chemical change a chemical
18:22
change
18:23
means new matter is made
18:29
the metal iron can rust
18:32
rusting is a chemical change
18:36
parts of iron very small parts parts of
18:39
iron change into new matter
18:42
which is not iron
18:46
okay that's the reading passage
18:49
now let's talk about how the reading or
18:52
the information the reading
18:53
passage was organized what is the
18:56
reading skill here we have
18:57
classify we classifies to separate into
19:00
different groups
19:01
and in this passage we talked about two
19:03
different groups
19:04
of how matter can change right we talked
19:07
about physical change
19:08
and we talked about chemical change okay
19:11
so first we have physical change
19:14
in physical change matter has changed
19:16
and looks different
19:17
but it is still the same matter this is
19:21
called
19:22
beep okay what is the beat this is
19:25
called a
19:26
physical change kind of interesting
19:29
physical change
19:31
oh oh my gosh it's over here
19:34
physical change p h y s
19:38
i c a l change so it's kind of odd that
19:42
you know it's the same thing really it
19:44
is still the same matter this is called
19:45
a physical change
19:47
salt can do what what do we talk about
19:49
we talked about different types of
19:51
changing or different
19:52
ways methods for changing salt can
19:56
dissolve in water dissolve dissolve
20:01
salt can dissolve in water
20:05
and what else what's the opposite of
20:07
dissolve
20:08
water can what evaporate
20:13
evaporate
20:15
so what we have here in our reading
20:17
skill is we have
20:19
one type of change that's a classifier
20:21
we say one type of change is physical
20:23
change
20:23
and then we have details of physical
20:25
change right first we have
20:27
we say we define what is physical change
20:29
and then we give one detail
20:31
dissolve is a type of physical change
20:33
and evaporate
20:35
is a type of physical change so we have
20:37
uh the group
20:39
what is it and what are two details
20:41
that's how this information is
20:42
organized it's a good way to organize
20:44
information in a reading passage
20:46
and the same thing happens for chemical
20:49
change so first we have chemical change
20:51
right
20:51
new matter is made this is called a
20:54
chemical change
20:55
so first we define what it is it's a
20:58
chemical
21:01
change oops this pen
21:04
yeah okay there we go so new matter is
21:07
made this is called a
21:08
chemical change so first we define it
21:10
new matter is made
21:12
that is what we call a chemical change
21:14
now what's a type of chemical
21:16
change the metal iron can remember when
21:18
the metal iron changes into a red or
21:21
brown material
21:22
we call that rust and
21:25
new matter is made okay so
21:28
this is a good way to organize your
21:30
information and reading passage
21:32
you know you might classify it you know
21:34
this group this group
21:35
define what is this group and then give
21:37
examples
21:38
then define what is the other group and
21:40
then give examples
21:42
that's a very good way to organize your
21:44
information in a reading
21:46
passage okay well this in this lesson
21:49
was kind of interesting
21:50
we saw how matter changes remember
21:52
matter can have three forms
21:54
gas liquid or solid and those forms
21:57
change
21:57
depending on the temperature and we cut
22:00
we have different
22:00
words for the types of changes that
22:03
occur
22:04
for example dissolve evaporate condense
22:08
so matter is actually always changing
22:12
form around us right water is changing
22:14
into a gas and then it changes back to a
22:16
liquid it rains on us
22:18
or it may change into a solid and come
22:21
down as snow
22:22
or ice hopefully it doesn't come down as
22:24
ice that's hail
22:26
but it can happen so matter is always
22:28
changing around us depending on the
22:30
temperature
22:31
and also depending on what processes or
22:34
what
22:34
what's happened what kind of forces are
22:37
being put
22:38
onto the matter so that's very
22:40
interesting to think about
22:42
nothing is permanent everything changes
22:45
but hopefully things are permanent long
22:46
enough so that you can enjoy them
22:48
okay so anyway there's an interesting
22:50
lesson today i hope you learned a lot
22:52
some new vocabulary some new ideas some
22:54
new ways of looking at the world around
22:56
you
22:57
i hope to see you in the next lesson
22:58
take care everybody bye bye
