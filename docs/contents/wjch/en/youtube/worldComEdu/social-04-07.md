hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
we're going over social studies book 4
lesson 7 go west there's a famous saying
in american history it's go west young
man
and it's supposed to have been said to
to by an older person to a younger
person
the younger person was asking advice
about what he should do with his life
and the older person said
go west young man the history of america
is very short
compared to many other countries in the
world of course american history is only
about
really 400 500 years old
unless of course we're talking about the
american indians and then we're talking
thousands of years
but the recent history which is much
more well
documented is really only about four to
five hundred years old
and uh the oregon trail
which we're going to talk about in this
lesson uh we will discover what the
oregon trail is and you can see this red
line
right i'm kind of tracing it with my pen
that goes to the american west
and many settlers european
immigrants who came to america settled
in america and then they
went west they followed certain routes
so
in this lesson we'll discover what the
oregon trail was
and also what american pioneers
carried with them and of course pioneers
are the people
who moved from the east to the west
really they it's kind of like they redid
their life they started their life
wholly new in a new place and it
sometimes
new climates new environments to start a
new life
so anyway that's a long introduction
let's get started
we start of course with the vocabulary
and as i said pioneer which is our first
word
i mentioned that that is what we call we
called the people who moved
from the east to the west but a pioneer
is
anybody who goes into a new
area and explores before
other people so it doesn't matter where
in the world it might be
if somebody goes to the north pole for
the first time
they are a pioneer if somebody goes to
the bottom of the
atlantic ocean and looks around explores
they are a pioneer nowadays when we talk
about pioneers
we're talking about space the first
people to the moon
maybe soon we will have the first people
to mars
they will be pioneers so pioneers are
just anybody
who goes to a place where people have
not gone before
and explores it before other people come
to that place as well
a trail a trail is a long
rough track made by the movement of
people
or animals now a long time ago of course
before people knew how to ride horses
they walked around by foot and also
animals were walking around obviously by
their four feet by their hooves
and as many animals or people went
along away they would make a trail right
the grass wouldn't grow there because
too many animals or people
are passing back and forth along this
this land
for a long time and so what they do is
they make a trail
so a trail is the very first
pathway that people used to move from
one place to another
of course later on came roads and then
highways
and now we have interstates right but
trails go back
thousands of years it's a long rough
track made by the movement of people
or animals
prepare to prepare is to
make yourself ready for something
you don't just make yourself ready you
also maybe prepare
equipment so you get all the stuff that
you need
you put it in a certain place you could
also prepare yourself
mentally maybe you're you're going to do
some sports so you prepare yourself
mentally
to play a game of soccer but prepare
just means to make
ready for something some event
next we have attack there's a
difficult not a difficult word but it's
kind of a uh
interesting word an attack is an act of
violence
to hurt a person or damage a place here
we see the dog
is trying to attack the person here
looks like they're training the dog
maybe it's a police dog but
that is a type of attack when somebody
starts an act of violence in order to
hurt or damage somebody
or someplace next we have
force force is the use
of physical power to make someone do
something against his or her
will to force somebody to do something
next we have journal do you keep a
journal
a journal is basically a daily record of
personal experience if you go on a trip
somewhere
it's a good idea to keep a journal to
write down
what you saw who you met and what you
did
that would be a journal
the last word is continue to continue is
to keep doing something for example this
is an interesting picture
uh oh i see what they're doing they're
doing the baton race or it's a relay
race
right so one runner has a baton runs and
he passes the baton to the next person
and the next person starts running
they're continuing
the race they're keeping the baton
moving
in the relay race okay so to continue is
to keep doing
what you are doing unfortunately we
can't continue with the vocabulary
because that's the last word
so we'll move on to the next section
okay
okay the first idea in this unit of
course we said oh we will discover
what the oregon trail was of course the
oregon trail
doesn't exist anymore unfortunately i
mean many historians
have preserved or they're they're
interested in
finding and preserving parts of the
trail but of course
most people don't use the oregon trail
anymore they drive in a car on a highway
or they take a train or they fly in an
airplane
but the oregon trail was very important
in the early 1800s
it follows a route a route is away
from missouri over here all the way to
oregon now
people use the oregon trail to go to
other places for example
they would use the oregon trail and they
would split right about here
to go to california or to other places
in the west
you know either in in of course oregon
northern california up near seattle
as well in washington or maybe they just
wanted to settle in idaho or go to
montana
many people did that as well so the
ideas about the oregon trail first we
have
many people move to the west to occupy
lands
and build homes now of course these
lands were occupied by american indians
but
there weren't um many american indians
there
there were there are of course thousands
of american indian tribes but they
weren't so many that they occupied all
the land
part of the reason i mean we could get
into a real big history lesson
but of course part of the reason for
that was the diseases that europeans
came
with them when they first came to
america
really decimated and killed many
american
indians many natives who lived on the
land before so the survivors of that
terrible epidemic
were what remained and there weren't
many
and of course so when america was
settled
the europeans the settlers they looked
at the west as wide open
there weren't many people living there
sure there were american indian tribes
but there was a lot of what they thought
would be empty land good for farming
and that attracted many people to leave
their
homes and their lives in the east and
move west
to get land for themselves to start a
farm and to start a new life
in what they considered a new area
now people called pioneers went to the
west along the oregon trail the oregon
trail was one of the famous
routes to get from the east to the west
in fact the oregon trail
it's not exactly the same route but
lewis and clark are
two famous explorers that went west
under jefferson jefferson financed their
trip
to find a route to the american
west coast for shipping and fur trade
and also to see all what the land had
and
and what natural resources uh the land
had
and they were the first western
explorers to go across the land of
course
they kind of wound up around up in here
and they kind of followed root but they
were they were a little bit more
northerly
after some time and many uh pioneers
went to oregon they found better ways to
go especially
if they had a big wagon if they're
pulling wagon with a lot of stuff
it was very difficult some of these
routes so the
pioneers the early pioneers of the
oregon trail
tried to find the best route for
pioneers with their horses and their
wagons
to get to the west they walked many
people walked or they rode horses
families traveled in wagons so of course
wagon travel
across this land there's no roads it's
very difficult
i mean in the midwest sure a lot of the
land was flat
as long as it wasn't too wet and muddy
uh it was easy to go along
but right around here you know you get
into mountains the rocky mountains
and those are very difficult to get
across people looked for passes
in the mountains of course their journey
was long and hard
you think about it nowadays you can fly
from new york to los angeles
in just a few hours but back then
getting from missouri
to oregon up in here took
months okay you had to leave early in
the spring
to make sure you got to your destination
before winter
and it became too cold and too snowy to
move
and there's a famous uh story about a
family
the donner family that got caught in the
snow in the mountains
ended in tragedy so anyway that's very
interesting
now it's funny too my dad is very
interested in the history of the oregon
trail
partly because one of the early pioneers
on the oregon trail
his name was robert stewart
my name is brian stewart same last name
but my dad's name is robert so he has
the same name
as one of the early pioneers of the
oregon trail and robert stewart
found an easier pass through the
mountains
around in here i think to get wagons
through
on the oregon trail so interesting okay
the other idea is that you know we
talked about the pioneers traveling in
their wagons and of course it's very
difficult
and long journey what did the early
pioneers
carry with them in their wagons well
they carried household goods especially
for emergencies
you can see what what are these things
this looks like a gas
lamp they are lamps uh you know you put
a little bit of oil in them
you light them up and they will give you
light and you know you could use a pan
on the back to help reflect the light if
it's a shiny pant
to give you more light or to concentrate
your light on something but of course
the pan was also used for eating as well
of course
cooking tools for making food of course
they brought many
metal pots and pans with them to cook
their food
over an open fire while traveling like i
said it took
many months to travel from missouri to
the west coast
so of course they made they had to cook
many meals along the way
they needed to bring their pots and pans
with them
of course many uh pioneers brought
treasures
for reminding them of home treasures
what do you mean treasures like gold and
silver
no things that are valuable to personal
people
you know maybe it's not valuable to
another person but it does have
sentimental value
or it reminds people of their home
sentimental by the way
means that it reminds you of an earlier
time a good
happy memory from your past so these
treasures could be like a doll like a
child could bring a doll with them some
people brought
very expensive china plates with them to
remind them
this was a gift from our parents when we
got married of course they packed them
very
well to make sure they didn't break but
other things like this and these are
their
personal treasures that they brought
with them
and of course they needed to bring tools
with them so
these are you know maybe primitive tools
but we can recognize
of them today of course you know a
hatchet for cutting woods
chisels for for making indentations in
wood
hammers saws drills
all sorts of different types of tools
that they brought from the east
because in the west there really wasn't
any civilization there were no towns
there were no
stores they couldn't just run down to
the hardware store and say
i need a screwdriver no they had to
bring all these things
with them because when they got to where
they were going
and they got to the land that they were
going to farm they needed to build a new
home and they needed tools
to cut down the wood and to build their
house
so these are things that pioneers
brought with them in their wagons
when they moved from the east to the
west
okay now it's time for the reading let's
go over the reading together
and as usual i will read it out loud
read along with me
either out loud or in your mind practice
on pronunciation
practice pronunciation and also focus on
the vocabulary words that we've learned
in this lesson are you guys ready let's
begin
as the united states started to grow
president
jefferson decided to explore the west
life was very hard for the early
pioneers
many pioneers followed the oregon
trail to go to the west
i just like to point out something
president jefferson
didn't go to the west don't be confused
by that
president jefferson wanted to explore
the west but he didn't personally go to
the west
he hired lewis and clark
to army officers to go explore and then
report back what they had found
and after they did that many other
people heard about
the west and they wanted to go out west
to make a new life
they were pioneers and they followed the
oregon trail
okay the journey was
long and hard so the pioneers had to
prepare
well everything they had
was in covered wagons including things
for
daily life such as ladles plates
irons and lamps
the pioneers also had to worry
about native american attacks
the american government forced native
americans
to move from their lands so the native
americans
would fight with the pioneers
it was hard for the early pioneers but
they continued to move to the west
looking for a new land and
a new life nowadays we can learn about
their lives
from the journals many pioneers
wrote okay
how is this reading passage organized
again we have main idea and we have
details to support that main idea
so the main idea here is that many
pioneers followed the
beep to go to the west okay that's the
main idea
what is the what did they follow to go
to the west what are we
what have we been talking about in this
lesson of course they followed the
oregon trail the oregon trail
i didn't mention it but why did they
call it the oregon trail because that
was the name of the
territory of the land that they were
going to is called oregon and of course
much later oregon became a state and
it's now the state of oregon
it's below washington it's washington
state
and it's above california so it's
between california and washington
on the west coast it's a very beautiful
coastline by the way
a very nice place okay
the journey was long and hard so the
pioneers had to
beep well what did they have to do well
before they started they had to think
about of course they had to plan their
journey
and they had to get all their equipment
ready what
vocabulary word did we learn that means
this of course they had
to prepare well prepare
so they had to prepare well they had to
get all their equipment all their tools
all their
stuff that they were going to bring with
them they had to figure out okay
we need to buy horses we need to buy a
wagon we need to make sure
everything is ready so they had to
prepare well
now as they moved along of course
they're moving through lands
that were owned or the native americans
didn't really
consider owning the land they just knew
that this is where they
this was their home this is where they
grew up but they didn't really
uh have like deeds or titles of course
to the land of course they knew what
their land was and they fought other
american indian tribes
for control of that land of course but
when the pioneers moved through
of course they didn't like all these
european settlers of their american
settlers but european
descendants moving through their land
and taking their land so they would
attack them of course
so the pioneers had to worry about
native american attacks
nowadays we can learn about their lives
their lives of course they're talking
about the pioneers
from the beep they wrote now what word
can we use here remember it's a record
of your daily experiences especially if
you go somewhere because you don't have
to take a trip to keep one
you know you can just keep one
ordinarily just a record of who you met
what you did and what are the things
that you uh that you're interested in
and of course that is a journal and i
mentioned the name
robert stewart before robert stewart was
one of the early pioneers
he kept a journal and his journal you
could read it nowadays so you could read
about
the difficulties that he had exploring
the oregon trail and the adventures that
he had
and of course there are many other
pioneers who kept journals
and they're famous now for historians
and to learn about the
old history of the west okay
well that about wraps up our lesson for
today so it's kind of an
interesting look at the
history of the west the old west in
american history
and it's a story of how the american
uh originally settlers i don't want to
say settlers because by that time they
were established on the east coast but
they wanted to settle the west
it's a story of how they went to the
west and the peoples that they
encountered
and the journeys that they had and the
difficult difficulties
that they had in moving from the east to
the west
okay well that wraps up our lesson i
hope you learned a lot and
hope you learned some new words as well
okay
that's it for today thank you for
studying with me and i hope to see you
in the next lesson
take care everybody
you

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading
00:11
i'm brian stewart and in this lesson
00:13
we're going over social studies book 4
00:16
lesson 7 go west there's a famous saying
00:20
in american history it's go west young
00:23
man
00:24
and it's supposed to have been said to
00:26
to by an older person to a younger
00:28
person
00:29
the younger person was asking advice
00:31
about what he should do with his life
00:32
and the older person said
00:34
go west young man the history of america
00:37
is very short
00:38
compared to many other countries in the
00:40
world of course american history is only
00:42
about
00:43
really 400 500 years old
00:46
unless of course we're talking about the
00:48
american indians and then we're talking
00:49
thousands of years
00:51
but the recent history which is much
00:53
more well
00:54
documented is really only about four to
00:57
five hundred years old
00:58
and uh the oregon trail
01:02
which we're going to talk about in this
01:04
lesson uh we will discover what the
01:06
oregon trail is and you can see this red
01:08
line
01:08
right i'm kind of tracing it with my pen
01:11
that goes to the american west
01:13
and many settlers european
01:16
immigrants who came to america settled
01:18
in america and then they
01:20
went west they followed certain routes
01:22
so
01:23
in this lesson we'll discover what the
01:25
oregon trail was
01:27
and also what american pioneers
01:31
carried with them and of course pioneers
01:34
are the people
01:35
who moved from the east to the west
01:38
really they it's kind of like they redid
01:40
their life they started their life
01:43
wholly new in a new place and it
01:45
sometimes
01:46
new climates new environments to start a
01:48
new life
01:49
so anyway that's a long introduction
01:51
let's get started
01:54
we start of course with the vocabulary
01:56
and as i said pioneer which is our first
01:58
word
01:59
i mentioned that that is what we call we
02:02
called the people who moved
02:04
from the east to the west but a pioneer
02:06
is
02:07
anybody who goes into a new
02:10
area and explores before
02:13
other people so it doesn't matter where
02:17
in the world it might be
02:19
if somebody goes to the north pole for
02:22
the first time
02:23
they are a pioneer if somebody goes to
02:25
the bottom of the
02:27
atlantic ocean and looks around explores
02:30
they are a pioneer nowadays when we talk
02:33
about pioneers
02:34
we're talking about space the first
02:36
people to the moon
02:38
maybe soon we will have the first people
02:40
to mars
02:42
they will be pioneers so pioneers are
02:45
just anybody
02:46
who goes to a place where people have
02:48
not gone before
02:50
and explores it before other people come
02:53
to that place as well
02:57
a trail a trail is a long
03:00
rough track made by the movement of
03:03
people
03:04
or animals now a long time ago of course
03:07
before people knew how to ride horses
03:10
they walked around by foot and also
03:13
animals were walking around obviously by
03:16
their four feet by their hooves
03:19
and as many animals or people went
03:22
along away they would make a trail right
03:25
the grass wouldn't grow there because
03:26
too many animals or people
03:28
are passing back and forth along this
03:30
this land
03:32
for a long time and so what they do is
03:34
they make a trail
03:36
so a trail is the very first
03:39
pathway that people used to move from
03:42
one place to another
03:43
of course later on came roads and then
03:46
highways
03:47
and now we have interstates right but
03:49
trails go back
03:50
thousands of years it's a long rough
03:52
track made by the movement of people
03:55
or animals
03:59
prepare to prepare is to
04:02
make yourself ready for something
04:05
you don't just make yourself ready you
04:07
also maybe prepare
04:08
equipment so you get all the stuff that
04:10
you need
04:11
you put it in a certain place you could
04:14
also prepare yourself
04:15
mentally maybe you're you're going to do
04:17
some sports so you prepare yourself
04:19
mentally
04:20
to play a game of soccer but prepare
04:22
just means to make
04:23
ready for something some event
04:27
next we have attack there's a
04:30
difficult not a difficult word but it's
04:32
kind of a uh
04:34
interesting word an attack is an act of
04:36
violence
04:38
to hurt a person or damage a place here
04:42
we see the dog
04:43
is trying to attack the person here
04:45
looks like they're training the dog
04:47
maybe it's a police dog but
04:50
that is a type of attack when somebody
04:53
starts an act of violence in order to
04:55
hurt or damage somebody
04:57
or someplace next we have
05:00
force force is the use
05:03
of physical power to make someone do
05:07
something against his or her
05:10
will to force somebody to do something
05:15
next we have journal do you keep a
05:18
journal
05:19
a journal is basically a daily record of
05:22
personal experience if you go on a trip
05:25
somewhere
05:25
it's a good idea to keep a journal to
05:28
write down
05:28
what you saw who you met and what you
05:31
did
05:32
that would be a journal
05:36
the last word is continue to continue is
05:39
to keep doing something for example this
05:42
is an interesting picture
05:44
uh oh i see what they're doing they're
05:45
doing the baton race or it's a relay
05:48
race
05:48
right so one runner has a baton runs and
05:51
he passes the baton to the next person
05:53
and the next person starts running
05:55
they're continuing
05:56
the race they're keeping the baton
05:59
moving
06:00
in the relay race okay so to continue is
06:03
to keep doing
06:04
what you are doing unfortunately we
06:06
can't continue with the vocabulary
06:08
because that's the last word
06:10
so we'll move on to the next section
06:12
okay
06:14
okay the first idea in this unit of
06:16
course we said oh we will discover
06:18
what the oregon trail was of course the
06:21
oregon trail
06:22
doesn't exist anymore unfortunately i
06:26
mean many historians
06:27
have preserved or they're they're
06:29
interested in
06:31
finding and preserving parts of the
06:33
trail but of course
06:34
most people don't use the oregon trail
06:36
anymore they drive in a car on a highway
06:38
or they take a train or they fly in an
06:41
airplane
06:42
but the oregon trail was very important
06:44
in the early 1800s
06:48
it follows a route a route is away
06:51
from missouri over here all the way to
06:54
oregon now
06:55
people use the oregon trail to go to
06:57
other places for example
06:59
they would use the oregon trail and they
07:00
would split right about here
07:02
to go to california or to other places
07:05
in the west
07:07
you know either in in of course oregon
07:10
northern california up near seattle
07:12
as well in washington or maybe they just
07:15
wanted to settle in idaho or go to
07:17
montana
07:18
many people did that as well so the
07:20
ideas about the oregon trail first we
07:22
have
07:22
many people move to the west to occupy
07:26
lands
07:27
and build homes now of course these
07:30
lands were occupied by american indians
07:33
but
07:33
there weren't um many american indians
07:36
there
07:36
there were there are of course thousands
07:38
of american indian tribes but they
07:40
weren't so many that they occupied all
07:42
the land
07:42
part of the reason i mean we could get
07:44
into a real big history lesson
07:46
but of course part of the reason for
07:47
that was the diseases that europeans
07:49
came
07:50
with them when they first came to
07:53
america
07:54
really decimated and killed many
07:57
american
07:58
indians many natives who lived on the
08:00
land before so the survivors of that
08:02
terrible epidemic
08:03
were what remained and there weren't
08:06
many
08:07
and of course so when america was
08:10
settled
08:11
the europeans the settlers they looked
08:12
at the west as wide open
08:14
there weren't many people living there
08:16
sure there were american indian tribes
08:18
but there was a lot of what they thought
08:20
would be empty land good for farming
08:22
and that attracted many people to leave
08:25
their
08:26
homes and their lives in the east and
08:28
move west
08:29
to get land for themselves to start a
08:33
farm and to start a new life
08:35
in what they considered a new area
08:38
now people called pioneers went to the
08:41
west along the oregon trail the oregon
08:43
trail was one of the famous
08:45
routes to get from the east to the west
08:47
in fact the oregon trail
08:50
it's not exactly the same route but
08:52
lewis and clark are
08:54
two famous explorers that went west
08:58
under jefferson jefferson financed their
09:01
trip
09:02
to find a route to the american
09:05
west coast for shipping and fur trade
09:08
and also to see all what the land had
09:11
and
09:11
and what natural resources uh the land
09:14
had
09:15
and they were the first western
09:17
explorers to go across the land of
09:18
course
09:19
they kind of wound up around up in here
09:22
and they kind of followed root but they
09:23
were they were a little bit more
09:24
northerly
09:26
after some time and many uh pioneers
09:30
went to oregon they found better ways to
09:32
go especially
09:33
if they had a big wagon if they're
09:35
pulling wagon with a lot of stuff
09:37
it was very difficult some of these
09:38
routes so the
09:40
pioneers the early pioneers of the
09:42
oregon trail
09:43
tried to find the best route for
09:46
pioneers with their horses and their
09:47
wagons
09:48
to get to the west they walked many
09:51
people walked or they rode horses
09:54
families traveled in wagons so of course
09:56
wagon travel
09:57
across this land there's no roads it's
10:00
very difficult
10:01
i mean in the midwest sure a lot of the
10:04
land was flat
10:05
as long as it wasn't too wet and muddy
10:08
uh it was easy to go along
10:09
but right around here you know you get
10:11
into mountains the rocky mountains
10:13
and those are very difficult to get
10:15
across people looked for passes
10:17
in the mountains of course their journey
10:20
was long and hard
10:22
you think about it nowadays you can fly
10:24
from new york to los angeles
10:26
in just a few hours but back then
10:29
getting from missouri
10:30
to oregon up in here took
10:33
months okay you had to leave early in
10:36
the spring
10:37
to make sure you got to your destination
10:40
before winter
10:41
and it became too cold and too snowy to
10:44
move
10:45
and there's a famous uh story about a
10:47
family
10:49
the donner family that got caught in the
10:51
snow in the mountains
10:52
ended in tragedy so anyway that's very
10:55
interesting
10:55
now it's funny too my dad is very
10:57
interested in the history of the oregon
10:59
trail
11:00
partly because one of the early pioneers
11:03
on the oregon trail
11:04
his name was robert stewart
11:08
my name is brian stewart same last name
11:12
but my dad's name is robert so he has
11:14
the same name
11:15
as one of the early pioneers of the
11:18
oregon trail and robert stewart
11:20
found an easier pass through the
11:22
mountains
11:23
around in here i think to get wagons
11:26
through
11:26
on the oregon trail so interesting okay
11:31
the other idea is that you know we
11:32
talked about the pioneers traveling in
11:34
their wagons and of course it's very
11:36
difficult
11:37
and long journey what did the early
11:39
pioneers
11:40
carry with them in their wagons well
11:43
they carried household goods especially
11:47
for emergencies
11:48
you can see what what are these things
11:50
this looks like a gas
11:51
lamp they are lamps uh you know you put
11:54
a little bit of oil in them
11:56
you light them up and they will give you
11:57
light and you know you could use a pan
12:00
on the back to help reflect the light if
12:03
it's a shiny pant
12:04
to give you more light or to concentrate
12:06
your light on something but of course
12:07
the pan was also used for eating as well
12:09
of course
12:10
cooking tools for making food of course
12:13
they brought many
12:14
metal pots and pans with them to cook
12:17
their food
12:18
over an open fire while traveling like i
12:20
said it took
12:21
many months to travel from missouri to
12:24
the west coast
12:25
so of course they made they had to cook
12:27
many meals along the way
12:29
they needed to bring their pots and pans
12:31
with them
12:32
of course many uh pioneers brought
12:35
treasures
12:36
for reminding them of home treasures
12:39
what do you mean treasures like gold and
12:41
silver
12:42
no things that are valuable to personal
12:45
people
12:45
you know maybe it's not valuable to
12:47
another person but it does have
12:49
sentimental value
12:50
or it reminds people of their home
12:53
sentimental by the way
12:55
means that it reminds you of an earlier
12:57
time a good
12:58
happy memory from your past so these
13:01
treasures could be like a doll like a
13:03
child could bring a doll with them some
13:05
people brought
13:06
very expensive china plates with them to
13:09
remind them
13:10
this was a gift from our parents when we
13:11
got married of course they packed them
13:13
very
13:14
well to make sure they didn't break but
13:16
other things like this and these are
13:17
their
13:18
personal treasures that they brought
13:19
with them
13:21
and of course they needed to bring tools
13:23
with them so
13:25
these are you know maybe primitive tools
13:27
but we can recognize
13:28
of them today of course you know a
13:30
hatchet for cutting woods
13:33
chisels for for making indentations in
13:35
wood
13:36
hammers saws drills
13:40
all sorts of different types of tools
13:42
that they brought from the east
13:43
because in the west there really wasn't
13:45
any civilization there were no towns
13:47
there were no
13:47
stores they couldn't just run down to
13:49
the hardware store and say
13:51
i need a screwdriver no they had to
13:52
bring all these things
13:54
with them because when they got to where
13:56
they were going
13:57
and they got to the land that they were
13:59
going to farm they needed to build a new
14:01
home and they needed tools
14:03
to cut down the wood and to build their
14:05
house
14:06
so these are things that pioneers
14:08
brought with them in their wagons
14:10
when they moved from the east to the
14:12
west
14:15
okay now it's time for the reading let's
14:17
go over the reading together
14:18
and as usual i will read it out loud
14:21
read along with me
14:22
either out loud or in your mind practice
14:25
on pronunciation
14:26
practice pronunciation and also focus on
14:29
the vocabulary words that we've learned
14:32
in this lesson are you guys ready let's
14:34
begin
14:36
as the united states started to grow
14:39
president
14:40
jefferson decided to explore the west
14:45
life was very hard for the early
14:47
pioneers
14:49
many pioneers followed the oregon
14:52
trail to go to the west
14:56
i just like to point out something
14:57
president jefferson
14:59
didn't go to the west don't be confused
15:01
by that
15:02
president jefferson wanted to explore
15:04
the west but he didn't personally go to
15:06
the west
15:07
he hired lewis and clark
15:10
to army officers to go explore and then
15:14
report back what they had found
15:16
and after they did that many other
15:18
people heard about
15:19
the west and they wanted to go out west
15:22
to make a new life
15:23
they were pioneers and they followed the
15:26
oregon trail
15:27
okay the journey was
15:31
long and hard so the pioneers had to
15:34
prepare
15:36
well everything they had
15:39
was in covered wagons including things
15:42
for
15:42
daily life such as ladles plates
15:46
irons and lamps
15:51
the pioneers also had to worry
15:54
about native american attacks
15:58
the american government forced native
16:01
americans
16:02
to move from their lands so the native
16:05
americans
16:06
would fight with the pioneers
16:11
it was hard for the early pioneers but
16:14
they continued to move to the west
16:17
looking for a new land and
16:20
a new life nowadays we can learn about
16:24
their lives
16:25
from the journals many pioneers
16:28
wrote okay
16:32
how is this reading passage organized
16:35
again we have main idea and we have
16:37
details to support that main idea
16:40
so the main idea here is that many
16:42
pioneers followed the
16:43
beep to go to the west okay that's the
16:46
main idea
16:47
what is the what did they follow to go
16:49
to the west what are we
16:50
what have we been talking about in this
16:52
lesson of course they followed the
16:54
oregon trail the oregon trail
16:59
i didn't mention it but why did they
17:01
call it the oregon trail because that
17:02
was the name of the
17:04
territory of the land that they were
17:06
going to is called oregon and of course
17:08
much later oregon became a state and
17:11
it's now the state of oregon
17:13
it's below washington it's washington
17:16
state
17:17
and it's above california so it's
17:18
between california and washington
17:21
on the west coast it's a very beautiful
17:23
coastline by the way
17:24
a very nice place okay
17:27
the journey was long and hard so the
17:30
pioneers had to
17:32
beep well what did they have to do well
17:34
before they started they had to think
17:36
about of course they had to plan their
17:38
journey
17:38
and they had to get all their equipment
17:40
ready what
17:41
vocabulary word did we learn that means
17:44
this of course they had
17:46
to prepare well prepare
17:50
so they had to prepare well they had to
17:51
get all their equipment all their tools
17:53
all their
17:54
stuff that they were going to bring with
17:55
them they had to figure out okay
17:57
we need to buy horses we need to buy a
17:59
wagon we need to make sure
18:01
everything is ready so they had to
18:03
prepare well
18:05
now as they moved along of course
18:06
they're moving through lands
18:08
that were owned or the native americans
18:11
didn't really
18:12
consider owning the land they just knew
18:14
that this is where they
18:16
this was their home this is where they
18:17
grew up but they didn't really
18:19
uh have like deeds or titles of course
18:24
to the land of course they knew what
18:25
their land was and they fought other
18:27
american indian tribes
18:29
for control of that land of course but
18:32
when the pioneers moved through
18:33
of course they didn't like all these
18:35
european settlers of their american
18:37
settlers but european
18:39
descendants moving through their land
18:41
and taking their land so they would
18:42
attack them of course
18:44
so the pioneers had to worry about
18:45
native american attacks
18:51
nowadays we can learn about their lives
18:54
their lives of course they're talking
18:55
about the pioneers
18:56
from the beep they wrote now what word
18:59
can we use here remember it's a record
19:01
of your daily experiences especially if
19:04
you go somewhere because you don't have
19:05
to take a trip to keep one
19:08
you know you can just keep one
19:09
ordinarily just a record of who you met
19:12
what you did and what are the things
19:14
that you uh that you're interested in
19:16
and of course that is a journal and i
19:19
mentioned the name
19:20
robert stewart before robert stewart was
19:22
one of the early pioneers
19:24
he kept a journal and his journal you
19:27
could read it nowadays so you could read
19:28
about
19:29
the difficulties that he had exploring
19:32
the oregon trail and the adventures that
19:34
he had
19:35
and of course there are many other
19:36
pioneers who kept journals
19:38
and they're famous now for historians
19:41
and to learn about the
19:42
old history of the west okay
19:46
well that about wraps up our lesson for
19:48
today so it's kind of an
19:49
interesting look at the
19:52
history of the west the old west in
19:55
american history
19:56
and it's a story of how the american
20:00
uh originally settlers i don't want to
20:02
say settlers because by that time they
20:04
were established on the east coast but
20:06
they wanted to settle the west
20:07
it's a story of how they went to the
20:09
west and the peoples that they
20:10
encountered
20:11
and the journeys that they had and the
20:13
difficult difficulties
20:15
that they had in moving from the east to
20:17
the west
20:18
okay well that wraps up our lesson i
20:20
hope you learned a lot and
20:22
hope you learned some new words as well
20:25
okay
20:25
that's it for today thank you for
20:27
studying with me and i hope to see you
20:28
in the next lesson
20:29
take care everybody
20:37
you
