hello everybody
welcome back to american textbook
reading my name is brian stewart
and in this lesson we're looking at
social studies book 4
lesson 15. that's right
the last lesson for social studies book
4.
wow we've covered a lot of ground well
in this
lesson we will discover two types of
natural resources
and what flow resources
are so let's take a look
okay we always start with the vocabulary
and our first
vocabulary word for this lesson is
coal coal of course is like a black
rock it's not a very hard rock right you
can break it
up it's it's not very very strong rock
but
it's a very important type of
resource and it is a kind of mineral
that is black and hard
and it is burned for heat that's the
important point
about coal many people use coal
to create heat whether it's in their
homes
or in their barbecues maybe you've been
to a restaurant
where they have a little metal pot and
they put it in there
and it has black pieces what are those
black pieces
of looks like rocks and they burn that's
really weird
but you can put it in the table and
you'll put a grill over it
and you can cook meat on top of it and a
barbecue restaurant
but that's one very common use of coal
of course coal is used for many
different reasons and has been used
for over a hundred years to help
create heat okay so that's coal
replace replace is a verb it is not a
noun
to replace something means that you have
something
maybe it's broken or you use it up so
you get a new thing
and you replace it so you use something
else
instead of something else and this is a
good example
if you and i hope you don't do this but
you know sometimes glass
glass can break so you can't use it
so this is broken so what do you do you
buy a new one
to replace the one that you can't use
anymore or
if you have something you use it all up
then you have to get something new
to replace what you have used up to
replace
to use a new thing instead of an old
thing
or a thing that has been that is gone is
no longer
okay environment
environment is a very important word
isn't it the environment
is the area in which you live and it
includes
the air the water and the land
so when we talk about the environment
we're usually talking about you know
three different things we're talking
about the air
around us we're talking about the land
on which we live and we travel
and we're also talking about the water
that that flows through the land
that the water that we drink or that we
use to grow plants
of course environment also includes the
living
things the plants and animals
that are around you so all of these
things
are uh make up part of the environment
the area or the your surroundings what
is around you
that is your environment now it doesn't
matter if you live in a city
if you live in a city your environment
is an
urban environment it includes the
buildings and the streets and the cars
and the noise
and all that other stuff if you live in
the countryside your environment is more
natural
right you have grass ground dirt
fresh air fresh water these are
different types of environments
okay soil now if
your environment is in the countryside
you are familiar with soil soil is
basically dirt but soil is the top part
of earth or ground and when we talk
about
soil we're usually talking about
earth or dirt that is good for growing
crops as you can see in the picture
usually it's black it's a little moist
and plants grow well in
soil in the desert you don't really find
soil it's just sand
or hard dirt there's not much
opportunity for plants to grow there
because there's not a lot of soil
but if you go into a forested woodland
or if you go to some places of the of
the world where
there's a lot of crops farmers grow a
lot of crops you will find
soil okay so soil is the top part of the
earth or ground
that is good for growing plants
pollute unfortunately this has become
more
common in the modern
world pollute excuse me pollute means to
make something
dirty or to add harmful
material to it so if you make something
dirty you've polluted it but
of course if you go out and you play in
the mud and you get mud and dirt on your
shirt
don't say i polluted my shirt that's a
little weird right
it's more commonly uh used for when
there's like
large companies or a lot
of harmful chemicals
in the air in the land or in the water
then we talk about pollution air
pollution this is a good picture of air
pollution
if there are many cars and the gas
coming out of the car
is not good it's not healthy for you to
breathe
it's toxic chemicals then you're
polluting the
air same thing if there's a lot of
harmful chemicals put into the water
then the water is polluted into the land
then the land
is polluted so to pollute means to
add harmful uh things
to something like the environment for
example
okay conservation
this has also become a very important
word
in our modern uh world conservation con
actually conservation comes from a root
word
to conserve to conserve that's a verb to
conserve means
to save or to keep in the original
uh condition so conservation
is the act or the actions of protecting
something from harm or damage
so you want to protect something so that
it is not damaged
or it is not harmed you conserve it you
keep it
in its natural state when we talk about
the environment
we want to keep the environment in a
natural state
not polluted so that we can enjoy it
then we're talking about conservation
okay but conservation
can be applied to many different things
not just the environment
just you're protecting something in its
natural or original
state okay last we have
run out it's a two-part verb run
out verb plus preposition verb
run preposition out run out
means that you've used all of something
to use all of something so if you're
cooking
chocolate chip cookies for today you
know and you have a bunch of chocolate
chips
and you put all the chocolate chips into
the cookie dough
you've run out of chocolate chips if you
want to make more chocolate chip cookies
you have to go to the store and buy some
more chocolate chips
right okay well of course that works for
everything right
and in this case they're looking at gas
right
uh there's only so much gasoline
in the world someday in the future
we'll run out of gas there won't be any
more gas to use
so that's another example of running out
of something
if you spend all your money you ran out
of money so don't do that
okay save some of your money but anyway
run out means to use
all of something it's all gone i've run
out of it okay those
are our words for today let's take a
look at the first main idea of this
lesson and the first main idea
is two types of natural
resources now in our vocabulary section
we just talked about
run out right you can run out of
something you can use something all up
and it's gone
but in this case what we're looking at
we're looking at renewable resources
and non-renewable resources
it's important to remember run out so
renew
means re re means again re
means again new of course is
new something it's new it's it's uh
it's generated it it was created
uh newly it's a new thing and able means
of course able to or can so
resources that you can
make new are renewable resources you can
make them
new again so resources like trees
water crops and fish can be replaced
if you cut down a tree and use the wood
of course that's a resource
but you can grow a new tree it may take
several years but it's renewable you can
replace it
after you run out of the certain tree
same thing with water if you use up the
water well hopefully it will rain
and more water will come same thing for
crops
you eat all the food hopefully there's
farmers
are growing new crops to replace those
things these are all
renewable resources they can be
replaced now if you put another
little word in front of renewable
right and you say none none means
not okay so not
able to make new again
right so non-re-new
able right there's like four different
small words going on here not again
new able not able to make
new not able to make new
non-renewable non-renewable resources
are resources like
coal oil natural gas
and gold you cannot replace them if you
use them all up you cannot replace them
actually that's not entirely true i mean
you can replace
coal but it takes millions of years
to replace it nobody is going to wait
that long
okay so you can't really replace coal
and oil
because it takes a very long time to
renew
those resources and under certain
conditions and nobody's going to wait a
million
years or several million years to get
more oil
or to get new coal so these are what we
call
non-renewable resources they you're
they're not
able we're not able to make new
resources like these
especially not in the time that we have
so what is the result of this okay
we must protect our resources and use
them wisely
so even if it's a renewable resource we
should still protect them we shouldn't
use them too
quickly right we can use them but we
also have to think about
how can we replace them for
non-renewable resources
we can't replace them so we have to be
very careful about
reducing our use and using them wisely
and these actions or these ideas are
called
conservation because you want to save or
you want to protect
your resources and keep them for a long
time
okay that's the first idea for this
lesson
the second idea is flow resources
now to be honest with you this is the
first time i've heard this
uh idea of flow resources
so i i was curious what what does flow
resources mean
usually flow means like something's
moving like if you look at a river
the river the water in the river is
flowing it's
moving so flow means to kind of move and
that's kind of what they're talking
about here
they're talking about sun and wind are
examples of flow resources
in other words they move or they are
they can move but they can also stop
they are renewable
but they cannot be used all the time if
you think about that yeah
wind wind doesn't always blow sometimes
there's no wind
sure the wind will probably come again
later tomorrow
next week next month if there's no wind
for a long time
but if there's no wind you can't use it
so if you have a wind
turbine and there's no wind of course
you're not making any energy so wind
is a flow resource it when it when the
wind is moving
you can use it but when it's not moving
you can't use it
same idea with the with the sun right
the sun is not always
up thank goodness you know i don't know
if you can sleep when the sun's up but
that's a little difficult it's much
easier to sleep
when the sun is down right so the sun
isn't always
shining we can't always get sunlight
to make power also if there's clouds
right the sun cannot go through the
clouds
so again it's hard to get solar power
when it's a cloudy day so
these types of powers these types of
resources that we use to make power we
can't use it
if it's not flowing so wind power can
make electricity for a lamp
but not if there's if there's no wind we
can't use it so basically flow resource
is a resource that is available some of
the time
but not all of the time okay
okay good
let's do the reading together now as
usual i will read it out loud
you can read along with me or you can
read along in your mind
focus on the vocabulary words and also
focus on any new words that you might
encounter uh
see listen to how i pronounce them see
if you can match it
okay you guys ready let's begin
the earth has many natural resources
that people need to live
trees coal oil
and water are all
natural resources
some resources can be replaced
if we plant another tree after we cut
a tree down new trees will grow
but some resources cannot
be replaced resources like
oil and coal will not last
forever one day
they will run out so we must be careful
when using these resources
using too many natural resources
can have a bad effect on the environment
if that happens it will make our lives
difficult if we cut down too many trees
the soil will be washed away
by rain and wind
using too much coal will pollute
the air
we should have conservation plans
to use our resources carefully
if we do this we can enjoy
our resources longer
okay good let's take a look at how the
information in this reading passage is
organized
and we here we have a good example of
cause
and effect remember cause is an action
that produces a result an effect
so action cause uh
prime mover okay action and result
cause and effect what are the causes the
causes
are on the left hand side and the
effects are on the right hand side and
of course they go straight across so
the first cause or the first action
could be
we cut down too many trees if we do that
what is the result what is the effect
the effect is the
beep will be washed away by rain and
wind
what word from the vocabulary did we
talk about
that i mentioned was it's like dirt but
it's
good for growing plants right
you don't find it in the desert we call
that
soil the soil
will be washed away by rain and wind and
this
has happened in history in some places
in the world where there have been
big civilizations right very
strong early civilizations the people
cut down all the trees
they they're they let their animals eat
all of the plants what happened
well the soil washed away and now
there's no soil it's a desert area
desertification and that's what happens
when we don't protect
the soil on the land
and then you know of course you have a
desert you have an area where plants
will not grow
and of course you can't live there so
that's a very terrible
effect and that has happened in history
many times
okay the next effect or the next cause
is
we use too much coal now when you burn
coal right we're talking about burning
coal when you burn it though you have a
lot of smoke and you have a lot of
carbon that gets released into the air
and a lot of harmful gases
so what will happen it will make it will
beep
the air it will make the air dirty it
will
add harmful uh elements to the air
what did we say if you make something
dirty or you put something
harmful into the environment whether
it's air land or water
then of course you are polluting that so
if you burn too much coal
you will pollute the air
pollute the air you will make it dirty
and it will be
bad to breathe that air
the next cause we should have plans to
use
our resources carefully so of course
some resources are
non-renewable we talked about that right
so if we use them all up they're gone
okay
there's no more so what would we do so
if we have plans to use our resources
carefully
if we practice conservation what is the
result or the effect of that we can
enjoy
our resources longer
in the reading passage it said of course
if we conserve
our resources if we plan to use our
resources
carefully we can enjoy our resources
our resources longer for a longer time
and that of course is important so this
is an important uh
lesson in the last lesson of the social
studies book
uh it's important to protect to conserve
our environment to to keep it safe from
too much pollution
of course we want to use resources it
makes our life
easier nobody wants to live like we did
you know
thousands of years ago that's very
difficult living conditions
so of course we enjoy living in the
modern world
but we need to be smart about how we use
our natural resources
like i said in history has a lot of
examples
of civilizations ruining their
environment
we don't want to do that again obviously
so we have to be very careful
of course we want to use resources we
want to enjoy
our standard of living but we also want
to make sure that we protect
our environment so that we can enjoy the
resources that we are using
for a longer time and of course new
technologies
hopefully will also improve other ways
to get
energy and resources more naturally
without harming the environment
so that is the promise of the future we
hope that it comes true
okay well this is an important lesson
obviously and it is the last lesson
for the social studies book now i've
enjoyed
uh talking with you guys or teaching you
uh
of course we've been focusing on english
but also a lot of other interesting
issues
about the world around us the people
around us
the different governments in the world
and the different ways of life so it's
very interesting i hope you continue
to study these types of topics and
keep looking around keep looking around
with an open mind
and learning more every day okay
thanks very much for studying with me
and i hope to see in the future sometime
okay
take it easy everybody bye bye
you

hello everybody
00:10
welcome back to american textbook
00:12
reading my name is brian stewart
00:15
and in this lesson we're looking at
00:17
social studies book 4
00:19
lesson 15. that's right
00:22
the last lesson for social studies book
00:26
4.
00:26
wow we've covered a lot of ground well
00:29
in this
00:30
lesson we will discover two types of
00:32
natural resources
00:34
and what flow resources
00:38
are so let's take a look
00:42
okay we always start with the vocabulary
00:44
and our first
00:45
vocabulary word for this lesson is
00:49
coal coal of course is like a black
00:52
rock it's not a very hard rock right you
00:55
can break it
00:56
up it's it's not very very strong rock
00:59
but
00:59
it's a very important type of
01:03
resource and it is a kind of mineral
01:06
that is black and hard
01:08
and it is burned for heat that's the
01:11
important point
01:13
about coal many people use coal
01:16
to create heat whether it's in their
01:20
homes
01:20
or in their barbecues maybe you've been
01:24
to a restaurant
01:25
where they have a little metal pot and
01:28
they put it in there
01:29
and it has black pieces what are those
01:32
black pieces
01:33
of looks like rocks and they burn that's
01:36
really weird
01:37
but you can put it in the table and
01:39
you'll put a grill over it
01:40
and you can cook meat on top of it and a
01:43
barbecue restaurant
01:45
but that's one very common use of coal
01:48
of course coal is used for many
01:50
different reasons and has been used
01:52
for over a hundred years to help
01:56
create heat okay so that's coal
02:01
replace replace is a verb it is not a
02:04
noun
02:05
to replace something means that you have
02:08
something
02:09
maybe it's broken or you use it up so
02:12
you get a new thing
02:13
and you replace it so you use something
02:16
else
02:17
instead of something else and this is a
02:19
good example
02:20
if you and i hope you don't do this but
02:22
you know sometimes glass
02:24
glass can break so you can't use it
02:28
so this is broken so what do you do you
02:31
buy a new one
02:32
to replace the one that you can't use
02:36
anymore or
02:37
if you have something you use it all up
02:39
then you have to get something new
02:41
to replace what you have used up to
02:44
replace
02:45
to use a new thing instead of an old
02:48
thing
02:49
or a thing that has been that is gone is
02:51
no longer
02:52
okay environment
02:56
environment is a very important word
02:58
isn't it the environment
03:00
is the area in which you live and it
03:03
includes
03:04
the air the water and the land
03:07
so when we talk about the environment
03:09
we're usually talking about you know
03:11
three different things we're talking
03:12
about the air
03:13
around us we're talking about the land
03:15
on which we live and we travel
03:17
and we're also talking about the water
03:20
that that flows through the land
03:22
that the water that we drink or that we
03:23
use to grow plants
03:25
of course environment also includes the
03:28
living
03:28
things the plants and animals
03:31
that are around you so all of these
03:34
things
03:35
are uh make up part of the environment
03:40
the area or the your surroundings what
03:43
is around you
03:44
that is your environment now it doesn't
03:46
matter if you live in a city
03:48
if you live in a city your environment
03:51
is an
03:51
urban environment it includes the
03:53
buildings and the streets and the cars
03:55
and the noise
03:56
and all that other stuff if you live in
03:58
the countryside your environment is more
04:00
natural
04:01
right you have grass ground dirt
04:04
fresh air fresh water these are
04:07
different types of environments
04:10
okay soil now if
04:14
your environment is in the countryside
04:17
you are familiar with soil soil is
04:20
basically dirt but soil is the top part
04:23
of earth or ground and when we talk
04:25
about
04:26
soil we're usually talking about
04:29
earth or dirt that is good for growing
04:32
crops as you can see in the picture
04:35
usually it's black it's a little moist
04:37
and plants grow well in
04:40
soil in the desert you don't really find
04:43
soil it's just sand
04:47
or hard dirt there's not much
04:50
opportunity for plants to grow there
04:52
because there's not a lot of soil
04:53
but if you go into a forested woodland
04:57
or if you go to some places of the of
04:59
the world where
05:00
there's a lot of crops farmers grow a
05:02
lot of crops you will find
05:04
soil okay so soil is the top part of the
05:07
earth or ground
05:08
that is good for growing plants
05:13
pollute unfortunately this has become
05:16
more
05:16
common in the modern
05:19
world pollute excuse me pollute means to
05:23
make something
05:24
dirty or to add harmful
05:27
material to it so if you make something
05:30
dirty you've polluted it but
05:32
of course if you go out and you play in
05:34
the mud and you get mud and dirt on your
05:36
shirt
05:37
don't say i polluted my shirt that's a
05:39
little weird right
05:40
it's more commonly uh used for when
05:43
there's like
05:45
large companies or a lot
05:48
of harmful chemicals
05:51
in the air in the land or in the water
05:55
then we talk about pollution air
05:57
pollution this is a good picture of air
05:59
pollution
06:00
if there are many cars and the gas
06:02
coming out of the car
06:04
is not good it's not healthy for you to
06:08
breathe
06:09
it's toxic chemicals then you're
06:12
polluting the
06:13
air same thing if there's a lot of
06:15
harmful chemicals put into the water
06:18
then the water is polluted into the land
06:20
then the land
06:21
is polluted so to pollute means to
06:25
add harmful uh things
06:28
to something like the environment for
06:30
example
06:32
okay conservation
06:35
this has also become a very important
06:37
word
06:38
in our modern uh world conservation con
06:42
actually conservation comes from a root
06:45
word
06:46
to conserve to conserve that's a verb to
06:50
conserve means
06:51
to save or to keep in the original
06:55
uh condition so conservation
06:58
is the act or the actions of protecting
07:02
something from harm or damage
07:06
so you want to protect something so that
07:08
it is not damaged
07:09
or it is not harmed you conserve it you
07:12
keep it
07:13
in its natural state when we talk about
07:15
the environment
07:16
we want to keep the environment in a
07:18
natural state
07:20
not polluted so that we can enjoy it
07:23
then we're talking about conservation
07:26
okay but conservation
07:27
can be applied to many different things
07:29
not just the environment
07:31
just you're protecting something in its
07:33
natural or original
07:35
state okay last we have
07:39
run out it's a two-part verb run
07:43
out verb plus preposition verb
07:46
run preposition out run out
07:49
means that you've used all of something
07:53
to use all of something so if you're
07:56
cooking
07:57
chocolate chip cookies for today you
07:59
know and you have a bunch of chocolate
08:01
chips
08:01
and you put all the chocolate chips into
08:03
the cookie dough
08:05
you've run out of chocolate chips if you
08:07
want to make more chocolate chip cookies
08:09
you have to go to the store and buy some
08:11
more chocolate chips
08:12
right okay well of course that works for
08:15
everything right
08:16
and in this case they're looking at gas
08:18
right
08:19
uh there's only so much gasoline
08:22
in the world someday in the future
08:25
we'll run out of gas there won't be any
08:28
more gas to use
08:29
so that's another example of running out
08:31
of something
08:32
if you spend all your money you ran out
08:35
of money so don't do that
08:36
okay save some of your money but anyway
08:38
run out means to use
08:40
all of something it's all gone i've run
08:43
out of it okay those
08:46
are our words for today let's take a
08:50
look at the first main idea of this
08:51
lesson and the first main idea
08:53
is two types of natural
08:57
resources now in our vocabulary section
09:00
we just talked about
09:01
run out right you can run out of
09:03
something you can use something all up
09:05
and it's gone
09:06
but in this case what we're looking at
09:08
we're looking at renewable resources
09:11
and non-renewable resources
09:14
it's important to remember run out so
09:17
renew
09:18
means re re means again re
09:21
means again new of course is
09:24
new something it's new it's it's uh
09:27
it's generated it it was created
09:31
uh newly it's a new thing and able means
09:34
of course able to or can so
09:38
resources that you can
09:41
make new are renewable resources you can
09:45
make them
09:46
new again so resources like trees
09:50
water crops and fish can be replaced
09:54
if you cut down a tree and use the wood
09:57
of course that's a resource
09:58
but you can grow a new tree it may take
10:01
several years but it's renewable you can
10:04
replace it
10:05
after you run out of the certain tree
10:09
same thing with water if you use up the
10:11
water well hopefully it will rain
10:13
and more water will come same thing for
10:16
crops
10:17
you eat all the food hopefully there's
10:19
farmers
10:20
are growing new crops to replace those
10:22
things these are all
10:24
renewable resources they can be
10:27
replaced now if you put another
10:31
little word in front of renewable
10:34
right and you say none none means
10:38
not okay so not
10:41
able to make new again
10:44
right so non-re-new
10:48
able right there's like four different
10:51
small words going on here not again
10:55
new able not able to make
10:59
new not able to make new
11:02
non-renewable non-renewable resources
11:06
are resources like
11:07
coal oil natural gas
11:11
and gold you cannot replace them if you
11:14
use them all up you cannot replace them
11:18
actually that's not entirely true i mean
11:20
you can replace
11:21
coal but it takes millions of years
11:25
to replace it nobody is going to wait
11:28
that long
11:29
okay so you can't really replace coal
11:32
and oil
11:33
because it takes a very long time to
11:36
renew
11:37
those resources and under certain
11:40
conditions and nobody's going to wait a
11:41
million
11:42
years or several million years to get
11:44
more oil
11:45
or to get new coal so these are what we
11:48
call
11:49
non-renewable resources they you're
11:51
they're not
11:52
able we're not able to make new
11:55
resources like these
11:57
especially not in the time that we have
12:00
so what is the result of this okay
12:04
we must protect our resources and use
12:07
them wisely
12:09
so even if it's a renewable resource we
12:12
should still protect them we shouldn't
12:13
use them too
12:14
quickly right we can use them but we
12:16
also have to think about
12:17
how can we replace them for
12:20
non-renewable resources
12:21
we can't replace them so we have to be
12:24
very careful about
12:25
reducing our use and using them wisely
12:28
and these actions or these ideas are
12:32
called
12:33
conservation because you want to save or
12:35
you want to protect
12:37
your resources and keep them for a long
12:40
time
12:41
okay that's the first idea for this
12:42
lesson
12:44
the second idea is flow resources
12:47
now to be honest with you this is the
12:49
first time i've heard this
12:51
uh idea of flow resources
12:54
so i i was curious what what does flow
12:57
resources mean
12:58
usually flow means like something's
13:00
moving like if you look at a river
13:02
the river the water in the river is
13:04
flowing it's
13:06
moving so flow means to kind of move and
13:08
that's kind of what they're talking
13:10
about here
13:11
they're talking about sun and wind are
13:15
examples of flow resources
13:19
in other words they move or they are
13:23
they can move but they can also stop
13:25
they are renewable
13:26
but they cannot be used all the time if
13:29
you think about that yeah
13:31
wind wind doesn't always blow sometimes
13:34
there's no wind
13:35
sure the wind will probably come again
13:38
later tomorrow
13:39
next week next month if there's no wind
13:42
for a long time
13:43
but if there's no wind you can't use it
13:46
so if you have a wind
13:48
turbine and there's no wind of course
13:51
you're not making any energy so wind
13:54
is a flow resource it when it when the
13:57
wind is moving
13:59
you can use it but when it's not moving
14:00
you can't use it
14:02
same idea with the with the sun right
14:04
the sun is not always
14:06
up thank goodness you know i don't know
14:08
if you can sleep when the sun's up but
14:10
that's a little difficult it's much
14:11
easier to sleep
14:12
when the sun is down right so the sun
14:15
isn't always
14:16
shining we can't always get sunlight
14:19
to make power also if there's clouds
14:22
right the sun cannot go through the
14:24
clouds
14:24
so again it's hard to get solar power
14:27
when it's a cloudy day so
14:30
these types of powers these types of
14:33
resources that we use to make power we
14:36
can't use it
14:37
if it's not flowing so wind power can
14:40
make electricity for a lamp
14:43
but not if there's if there's no wind we
14:46
can't use it so basically flow resource
14:48
is a resource that is available some of
14:50
the time
14:51
but not all of the time okay
14:54
okay good
14:58
let's do the reading together now as
15:00
usual i will read it out loud
15:02
you can read along with me or you can
15:04
read along in your mind
15:06
focus on the vocabulary words and also
15:10
focus on any new words that you might
15:12
encounter uh
15:13
see listen to how i pronounce them see
15:15
if you can match it
15:16
okay you guys ready let's begin
15:20
the earth has many natural resources
15:24
that people need to live
15:28
trees coal oil
15:31
and water are all
15:34
natural resources
15:38
some resources can be replaced
15:42
if we plant another tree after we cut
15:46
a tree down new trees will grow
15:52
but some resources cannot
15:55
be replaced resources like
15:58
oil and coal will not last
16:02
forever one day
16:05
they will run out so we must be careful
16:09
when using these resources
16:15
using too many natural resources
16:18
can have a bad effect on the environment
16:22
if that happens it will make our lives
16:26
difficult if we cut down too many trees
16:30
the soil will be washed away
16:33
by rain and wind
16:37
using too much coal will pollute
16:40
the air
16:44
we should have conservation plans
16:48
to use our resources carefully
16:52
if we do this we can enjoy
16:56
our resources longer
16:59
okay good let's take a look at how the
17:04
information in this reading passage is
17:06
organized
17:07
and we here we have a good example of
17:09
cause
17:10
and effect remember cause is an action
17:14
that produces a result an effect
17:17
so action cause uh
17:21
prime mover okay action and result
17:25
cause and effect what are the causes the
17:28
causes
17:28
are on the left hand side and the
17:32
effects are on the right hand side and
17:34
of course they go straight across so
17:36
the first cause or the first action
17:39
could be
17:39
we cut down too many trees if we do that
17:42
what is the result what is the effect
17:45
the effect is the
17:46
beep will be washed away by rain and
17:49
wind
17:50
what word from the vocabulary did we
17:52
talk about
17:54
that i mentioned was it's like dirt but
17:57
it's
17:57
good for growing plants right
18:01
you don't find it in the desert we call
18:03
that
18:04
soil the soil
18:07
will be washed away by rain and wind and
18:10
this
18:10
has happened in history in some places
18:13
in the world where there have been
18:14
big civilizations right very
18:17
strong early civilizations the people
18:20
cut down all the trees
18:22
they they're they let their animals eat
18:24
all of the plants what happened
18:26
well the soil washed away and now
18:29
there's no soil it's a desert area
18:31
desertification and that's what happens
18:34
when we don't protect
18:35
the soil on the land
18:38
and then you know of course you have a
18:40
desert you have an area where plants
18:42
will not grow
18:43
and of course you can't live there so
18:45
that's a very terrible
18:46
effect and that has happened in history
18:48
many times
18:50
okay the next effect or the next cause
18:53
is
18:53
we use too much coal now when you burn
18:56
coal right we're talking about burning
18:58
coal when you burn it though you have a
19:00
lot of smoke and you have a lot of
19:02
carbon that gets released into the air
19:04
and a lot of harmful gases
19:07
so what will happen it will make it will
19:10
beep
19:10
the air it will make the air dirty it
19:13
will
19:14
add harmful uh elements to the air
19:17
what did we say if you make something
19:19
dirty or you put something
19:20
harmful into the environment whether
19:23
it's air land or water
19:25
then of course you are polluting that so
19:28
if you burn too much coal
19:29
you will pollute the air
19:33
pollute the air you will make it dirty
19:35
and it will be
19:36
bad to breathe that air
19:39
the next cause we should have plans to
19:42
use
19:43
our resources carefully so of course
19:45
some resources are
19:47
non-renewable we talked about that right
19:49
so if we use them all up they're gone
19:51
okay
19:52
there's no more so what would we do so
19:56
if we have plans to use our resources
20:00
carefully
20:00
if we practice conservation what is the
20:04
result or the effect of that we can
20:06
enjoy
20:07
our resources longer
20:10
in the reading passage it said of course
20:12
if we conserve
20:14
our resources if we plan to use our
20:18
resources
20:19
carefully we can enjoy our resources
20:22
our resources longer for a longer time
20:26
and that of course is important so this
20:29
is an important uh
20:31
lesson in the last lesson of the social
20:34
studies book
20:35
uh it's important to protect to conserve
20:38
our environment to to keep it safe from
20:41
too much pollution
20:42
of course we want to use resources it
20:44
makes our life
20:45
easier nobody wants to live like we did
20:48
you know
20:48
thousands of years ago that's very
20:50
difficult living conditions
20:53
so of course we enjoy living in the
20:55
modern world
20:56
but we need to be smart about how we use
20:59
our natural resources
21:00
like i said in history has a lot of
21:02
examples
21:03
of civilizations ruining their
21:06
environment
21:07
we don't want to do that again obviously
21:09
so we have to be very careful
21:11
of course we want to use resources we
21:13
want to enjoy
21:14
our standard of living but we also want
21:17
to make sure that we protect
21:19
our environment so that we can enjoy the
21:21
resources that we are using
21:23
for a longer time and of course new
21:25
technologies
21:26
hopefully will also improve other ways
21:30
to get
21:30
energy and resources more naturally
21:33
without harming the environment
21:35
so that is the promise of the future we
21:37
hope that it comes true
21:38
okay well this is an important lesson
21:40
obviously and it is the last lesson
21:43
for the social studies book now i've
21:45
enjoyed
21:46
uh talking with you guys or teaching you
21:49
uh
21:49
of course we've been focusing on english
21:51
but also a lot of other interesting
21:53
issues
21:54
about the world around us the people
21:56
around us
21:57
the different governments in the world
21:59
and the different ways of life so it's
22:01
very interesting i hope you continue
22:03
to study these types of topics and
22:06
keep looking around keep looking around
22:09
with an open mind
22:10
and learning more every day okay
22:13
thanks very much for studying with me
22:15
and i hope to see in the future sometime
22:18
okay
22:18
take it easy everybody bye bye
22:27
you
