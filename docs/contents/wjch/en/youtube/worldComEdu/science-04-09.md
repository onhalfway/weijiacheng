hello everybody welcome back to american
textbook reading
my name is brian stewart and let's talk
about the weather that is the subject
for today's lesson
in science book 4 lesson 9
changes in weather and weather is a very
common topic
to talk about among people in this
unit or in this lesson you will discover
dangerous types of weather
and also different types of clouds
okay so let's get started
our first word in the vocabulary section
is
blizzard blizzard
okay it's a little hard to pronounce
maybe
blizzard b and l together
blizzard a blizzard is a
storm with lots of snow
and wind you don't want to be
in a blizzard it's like the snow is
flying at you
directly it's not just falling from the
sky
it's coming at you directly from the
wind
so blizzard is a very strong storm where
a lot of snow
falls so be careful we have to be
careful in a blizzard
a thunderstorm a thunderstorm is very
exciting
right but be careful don't be outside in
high places
or next to large bodies of water
or holding anything like a golf club
okay
because a thunderstorm a thunderstorm is
a storm with lots of
lightning what is lightning well you can
see in the picture lightning
here and here lightning is the really
strong
electrical charge that comes from the
sky
and sometimes it hits the ground and
when you see lightning
you should count one one thousand two
one thousand three one thousand
then you hear right and you hear a very
loud
noise and that is thunder and
you can tell how far a storm is by
counting
if you see the lightning and then the
thunder's right right away
you know the storm is right on top of
you but if you count one one thousand
two one thousand three one thousand
and then a few more and then you hear
the sound of thunder
you know the storm is far away so
interesting
next time you see lightning count and
then when you hear the thunder you think
oh it's far away
okay tornado
now a tornado is an interesting
storm it's very dangerous of course we
have to be careful about tornadoes
a tornado is a storm where spinning wind
spinning spinning means to turn around
in a circle
and in this case a tornado is spinning
very fast
and it comes down from a cloud so the
tornado
starts in the sky in the cloud and it's
not just wind that comes down like this
now it's wind that's spinning really
quickly and if it has enough force
it will it will make a funnel and come
down to the ground
we have a video let's take a look at it
here
is a video of the tornado you can see
the the grass is kind of moving back and
forth because it's windy
and you can see the tornado the tornado
seems to be
far away but you can see it slowly
turning
and this tornado is kind of far away so
it's a little difficult to see
but uh sometimes you can see
like just the the top part of the
tornado
you can see it beginning to form it's
like a little bowl
and it starts to grow longer and longer
until the
we call it the funnel
grows until it touches the ground and
when it touches the ground that's a lot
of force there
and it's blowing things around it's so
strong it can blow cars around it can
blow
cows around it blew dorothy's house
all the way to the land of oz in the
book
the wizard of oz check it out it's very
it's a very good story
it's also a good movie um but anyway
tornado is a very
strong wind and we have to be careful
about tornadoes
okay next we have hurricane
now hurricanes what's worse a tornado
or a hurricane well a tornado only lasts
for a short time
but it can cause a lot of damage in its
small
path a tornado has a small path if
you're like
one kilometer or two kilometers to the
side either way
and the tornado goes between you there's
no problem
but a hurricane is huge and a hurricane
lasts for a long time like many days
when it hits land of course it it loses
its power
but a hurricane can last for days so a
hurricane is
worse than a tornado because it affects
a
larger area and it lasts for a much
longer time so a hurricane is a very
large storm
that has fast winds and lots of rain
but the fast winds are what we have to
be careful of
and we've seen in the news about
hurricanes especially
in the past that have really damaged big
cities like there's a famous hurricane
hurricane katrina
which really damaged new orleans and
areas around there
there's another difference though
between a hurricane
and a tornado hurricanes
happen over water over the ocean or a
sea tornadoes happen
over land okay so tornadoes will happen
in
kansas colorado uh areas where there
isn't a lot of water but it's just very
flat land
and there's a place i think it's in
oklahoma it's called tornado
alley where tornadoes every year
there's a very good chance for a tornado
to come through this area it's called
tornado alley
but there's no water nearby but
off the coast right hurricanes form over
the ocean
and then they move into land and then
they cause a lot of damage on the
coastal cities
you don't have to worry about a
hurricane if you're in kansas or
colorado
in the middle of the country of america
because hurricanes you know by the time
they get there
they lose all their power so they get
their power over water
and they move on to land so a couple of
differences between hurricanes
and tornadoes a flood
now a flood is what happens hurricanes
cause flood
because there's a lot of rain coming
down and there's a lot of wind and it
pushes sometimes it pushes the sea water
into a low area and of course it's
raining a lot so it dumps a lot of water
onto the area as well so a flood of
course is a large amount of water
covering an area that is usually dry
and we can see this of course in many
cities unfortunately around the world
bangladesh has a very serious flooding
problem
they get a lot of hurricanes i believe
they call them cyclones over there
and because bangladesh
is very low country there's not a lot of
hills or mountains in bangladesh it's
very low
uh near the sea level so it pushes the
sea water
into the land and also again it dumps a
lot of rain
and so a lot of areas in bangladesh are
affected by flooding almost every year
and of course many other regions of the
uh earth as well are affected by
hurricanes
and flooding it's a disaster okay
next we have hibernate hibernate do you
hibernate sometimes i'm sure
you wish you could hibernate that just
means to sleep for a very long time
actually to sleep all winter for some
animals to spend
all winter sleeping of course when we
talk about hibernate and we're talking
about animals
animals only hibernate in winter they
don't hibernate in spring
summer or fall only in the winter why
because there's not a lot of food in the
winter
consider the bear in his cave bears are
famous for hibernating
they go into a cave or somewhere
underground and they sleep for several
months
why do they do that because the land is
frozen it's covered with snow
there's not much food for the bear to
find and it's also
difficult for the bear a large animal to
move around in the snow
it has to use up a lot of energy it
can't find enough food to
to replace that energy so it just says
forget it i'm going to sleep
and it goes to sleep during the winter
months and then in the spring
it wakes up and it comes out you do not
want to be
near a bear in the spring that just came
out of hibernation
it's very hungry okay so
so the bear will come out when the snow
is gone and it can find
food easily okay
destroy destroy means to damage
something
so that it cannot be used again now you
can
damage something a little bit right if
you hit something and put a dent
in for example a car you've damaged the
car
but you didn't destroy it destroy is
when
there's so much damage that the thing
for example the car cannot be used
anymore
it cannot be used again it doesn't work
and that's you know if a car
hits a wall at a very high speed the car
will be broken
it is destroyed okay so yeah be careful
don't damage things obviously
but destroy just means that to damage
something so much
that you can't use it again so it's very
severe damage
okay those are our words for this lesson
let's move on
the first main idea of this lesson is
the changing weather
and we've talked about some dangerous
weather
conditions in the vocabulary remember we
talked about a blizzard
a blizzard of course it's very bad
snowstorm
with strong winds now we can have a
snowstorm with no winds and actually
that's kind of magical really
it's it's amazing just to it's very calm
there's no wind and you just see very
large snowflakes falling
and if the land is covered with snow and
you see this kind of weather
it's very peaceful and it's like magical
but
if the wind is blowing very strongly
that's a little dangerous right
and the snow's coming right at you
especially if you're driving a car
in a blizzard it can be very dangerous
because then the road gets slippery too
and it's very difficult to see the road
ahead of you
so it's very dangerous you shouldn't
drive in a blizzard obviously
and you should stay home in a blizzard
also because it's very
difficult to walk around as well
next we have a thunderstorm and a
thunderstorm of course as we said is a
storm with
heavy rain thunder and
lightning lightning is the flash of
light and thunder is a really big
sound that comes after the flash of
light
next we have tornado and we talked about
a tornado a tornado is a
spinning area of wind
and it sometimes it gets so strong that
it touches down to the ground and when
it touches
onto the ground it can cause a lot of
damage it can destroy things
because it's spinning very fastly
tornadoes move actually
some tornadoes move quickly but some
tornadoes don't move quickly they're
kind of slow
but if they touch a building or they ca
they can destroy the building they can
pick up
cars they can pick up animals they can
pick up people
and you do not want to be in a tornado
okay
a hurricane is a really large
storm that starts over warm
ocean water if the ocean water is warm
and the conditions are right
a hurricane will form like i said before
hurricanes
form over water and then they move on to
land and cause a lot of damage to homes
and cities and towns that are on
the land tornadoes form over land they
stay on land they don't go
over water okay so those are different
types of changing weather these are
different types
of very severe weather conditions
dangerous weather conditions okay
next we can talk about clouds and
weather this is a little more
calm but you can look up into the sky
and you can look at the clouds and you
can tell
what the weather is like just by looking
at the clouds in fact
if you if you get up in the morning you
look outside the window
you want to know what the weather's like
just look at the clouds
if you see these types of puffy white
clouds they look like big cotton balls
floating in the sky they're called
cumulus cumulus
cumulus clouds they are dense
dense means they're thick right they
look like big cotton balls or
or maybe vanilla ice cream floating in
the sky
and they are white clouds you know that
you have good weather
it's not raining you know the sun is
shining between the clouds
and it's probably nice and cool
cool crisp weather i hope okay but
that's
good weather okay now if you look up in
the sky and you don't see
the cumulus clouds but you see like
these very thin
white layer of clouds way high up in the
sky really high
we call those stratus stratus they are
flat
and they are layered layered means you
know you have one layer here
another layer here they're layered on
top of each other
if you see that you know that you have
well obviously it's cloudy you see the
clouds but you
also can tell that you're going to have
dry weather not
much rain and maybe little humidity
in the air humidity is
the amount of moisture in the air
okay so you have cloudy and dry weather
if you see the stratus clouds
now other times you can see these
different types of clouds now you see
it's a little bit hard to see the
difference
but you know stratus are flat layered
clouds but
cirrus cirrus clouds are also very high
but instead of being flat layered
they're kind of like
little thin strips going through the the
very high blue sky
they're high obviously when i said that
they're thin
thin clouds and they're wispy what does
wispy mean wispy means that they're
well wispy is kind of like the opposite
of dense right
they're it's like they're almost not
there
it's very they're very delicate and you
can see through them
right they're wispy and of course if you
see that
you know that you will have good weather
so cirrus clouds seriously good weather
okay okay serious don't get confused
right
sirius is me means i'm not joking right
but
cirrus clouds are seriously good weather
okay the next one oh my god how do you
pronounce that
okay this is a little difficult to
pronounce right but remember we just
talked about this word
and you can see that this word is very
similar so
we pronounce this word as cumulus
so we can start with the same uh way
for okay but i'll slow down okay
q mulo nymbus q
q like q like cute oh it's very cute but
these clouds aren't cute
cumulonimbus cumulonimbus
cumulonimbus can you say it quickly okay
but these clouds are not nice clouds
they're not like the other three
where they have nice good weather if you
see these clouds
they're heavy they're gray and why are
they heavy and gray
because they're filled with moisture
they're filled with water
and they just want to dump that water on
your head
so if you see these clouds you know that
bad weather is coming one more time
cumulonimbus cumulonimbus
okay good yeah at first glance you're
like oh my gosh how do i pronounce that
but it's okay you can do it okay let's
move on to the story
okay as usual i will read the story out
loud you guys repeat after me
uh in your head or out loud focus on the
pronunciation
and also try to review focus on the
words that we
went over in the vocabulary section
are you guys ready let's begin
as the seasons change the weather
changes too
summer is usually hot
after summer comes fall and
it is colder after fall
comes winter winter
is the coldest season
in winter blizzards can happen
some animals hibernate over the winter
they wake up in spring when there is
more
food and it is warmer
storms can change the weather
quickly a thunderstorm has
many dark clouds and lightning
lightning is like electricity and
it can kill and destroy things
lightning makes a sound called thunder
that is why it is called a thunderstorm
tornadoes can happen in thunderstorms
a tornado comes down from the clouds
the wind moves very quickly in a circle
if the tornado touches anything
it can destroy it
hurricanes are the biggest storms
the wind is very very fast
and there is a lot of rain floods
can happen okay
that's the reading section
okay so how is the information in this
reading passage
organized well here we have the very
common organizational pattern
main idea and details or examples
that support that main idea what is the
main idea
in this passage the main idea is here
changes in weather cause
many things to happen well many things
is very general it's not specific
what things then we have to support that
by giving specific
examples so we have four different
specific examples
of the many things that can happen
well first of all we have winter now
winter really isn't
a weather type it's a season but during
that season the weather does
change and winter is the coldest season
right there's a lot of snow
the temperatures drop so winter is the
coldest season
what happens during winter what kinds of
storms did we
see in the passage that occur
during occur or happen during winter
well of course we saw the storm where a
lot of snow falls and the
wind blows very strongly we call those
storms
blizzards b l i z
z a r d s blizzards because there are
many blizzards
blizzards can happen and
some animals say blizzards forget that
i'm going to sleep
so if some animals sleep for the whole
winter there's a special word for that
what do we call that we call that
hibernate hypernate
hibernate and bears hibernate i wish
i could hibernate some also during the
winter it's too cold
and i don't want to drive in the snow
okay so but anyway unfortunately
we still go to school and we still go to
work during the winter
don't hibernate your mom will be mad
okay so some animals hibernate
over the winter okay next
we have beep our storms with lots of
lightning when we talked about these
types of storms and i said you know when
you see the lightning
wait because you hear a big sound after
it and of course that sound is called
thunder and that's kind of the answer
right thunderstorms
thunder thunder it's a
long word oh no i'm running out of room
thunderstorms thunderstorms are storms
with lots of lightning
and thunder lightning is like
electricity well it is electricity
in fact there's a famous story about ben
franklin
he's he was a not just a famous american
politician
he was also a scientist and a very smart
person and he flew a kite into a storm
to capture some of that energy to figure
out what is electricity
and he was one of the early scientists
to figure out electricity
and to figure out how to use it and
thanks to him and many other scientists
we use electricity in our homes and we
get light
okay anyway we're talking about storms
okay the next one is beep can happen in
thunderstorms so what is beep well many
things can happen in thunderstorms we
need more information
so we have another clue here great
the wind moves very quickly in a circle
so the wind is moving very quickly in a
circle right and they can happen or they
can form during
thunderstorms what was it that we read
about
we read about tornadoes tor
tornay doze
tornadoes and we put s actually put yes
but i just want to point out that
tornadoes the dictionary says that
you can spell the plural of tornadoes
two ways you don't need an e it's one of
those words in english where some people
spell it this way
other people spell it this way and
nobody can agree so both ways are
accepted okay
so you can either put es or just s
but again you need to put s because
we're talking about
things in general when you're talking
about something in general
and it is a count noun make it plural
and of course sometimes you put an s on
it sometimes you put an e s
on it but we have blizzards
thunderstorms
tornadoes these are all count nouns
we're talking about them
generally so we make them plural and one
more example of that is over here
now beep are the biggest storms
floods can happen so we talked about
that i compared tornadoes
with what with hurricanes
hurricanes
and here it's already e just put an s oh
and i'm sorry about that i put a little
line here i meant to spell
tornay doze
that's also okay so both ways are okay
it doesn't matter
okay but anyway coming back to
hurricanes just s on the end
hurricanes are the biggest storms
right they're a lot larger and they form
over warm water
and they bring all that water to the
land they dump it on the land
and what happens we have floods so
coming back to the main idea
changes in weather cause many things to
happen
snow will fall down very snow will fall
down
a lot that's something that can happen
during the winter in a thunderstorm
lightning can hit the ground be careful
it's dangerous
also tornadoes can form from
thunderstorms that's another thing that
can happen
and hurricanes cause floods and a lot of
damage
on land when they hit land so
obviously we have to be careful in
severe
or dangerous weather conditions
and of course you probably see a lot of
these on the news hopefully these things
don't happen where you live
or if they do the weather forecast will
tell you
if there is a severe storm event
coming your way stay inside stay with
your family
if this if the news says you have to
leave move somewhere else
then do so right don't be in the path of
a hurricane
okay or a tornado okay anyway
there's a very interesting obviously
there's a lot of different changes in
the weather
nature can be very beautiful it can be
very amazing
but we also have to respect it and
understand that it can sometimes be
dangerous
so anyway that's a interesting lesson
into talking about different types
of weather i hope you learned a lot as
always and we hope to see you
in the next video lesson anyway that's
it for today
take care everybody see you later

hello everybody welcome back to american
00:10
textbook reading
00:12
my name is brian stewart and let's talk
00:14
about the weather that is the subject
00:17
for today's lesson
00:18
in science book 4 lesson 9
00:21
changes in weather and weather is a very
00:24
common topic
00:25
to talk about among people in this
00:29
unit or in this lesson you will discover
00:31
dangerous types of weather
00:34
and also different types of clouds
00:37
okay so let's get started
00:42
our first word in the vocabulary section
00:45
is
00:46
blizzard blizzard
00:49
okay it's a little hard to pronounce
00:50
maybe
00:52
blizzard b and l together
00:55
blizzard a blizzard is a
00:58
storm with lots of snow
01:01
and wind you don't want to be
01:05
in a blizzard it's like the snow is
01:07
flying at you
01:09
directly it's not just falling from the
01:11
sky
01:12
it's coming at you directly from the
01:14
wind
01:15
so blizzard is a very strong storm where
01:18
a lot of snow
01:19
falls so be careful we have to be
01:21
careful in a blizzard
01:24
a thunderstorm a thunderstorm is very
01:27
exciting
01:28
right but be careful don't be outside in
01:31
high places
01:33
or next to large bodies of water
01:36
or holding anything like a golf club
01:39
okay
01:40
because a thunderstorm a thunderstorm is
01:43
a storm with lots of
01:45
lightning what is lightning well you can
01:47
see in the picture lightning
01:49
here and here lightning is the really
01:52
strong
01:52
electrical charge that comes from the
01:55
sky
01:56
and sometimes it hits the ground and
01:58
when you see lightning
01:59
you should count one one thousand two
02:02
one thousand three one thousand
02:04
then you hear right and you hear a very
02:07
loud
02:08
noise and that is thunder and
02:11
you can tell how far a storm is by
02:14
counting
02:14
if you see the lightning and then the
02:16
thunder's right right away
02:18
you know the storm is right on top of
02:20
you but if you count one one thousand
02:23
two one thousand three one thousand
02:25
and then a few more and then you hear
02:27
the sound of thunder
02:28
you know the storm is far away so
02:31
interesting
02:32
next time you see lightning count and
02:34
then when you hear the thunder you think
02:35
oh it's far away
02:37
okay tornado
02:41
now a tornado is an interesting
02:44
storm it's very dangerous of course we
02:47
have to be careful about tornadoes
02:49
a tornado is a storm where spinning wind
02:53
spinning spinning means to turn around
02:55
in a circle
02:56
and in this case a tornado is spinning
02:59
very fast
03:00
and it comes down from a cloud so the
03:03
tornado
03:04
starts in the sky in the cloud and it's
03:06
not just wind that comes down like this
03:08
now it's wind that's spinning really
03:09
quickly and if it has enough force
03:12
it will it will make a funnel and come
03:14
down to the ground
03:15
we have a video let's take a look at it
03:18
here
03:19
is a video of the tornado you can see
03:20
the the grass is kind of moving back and
03:23
forth because it's windy
03:24
and you can see the tornado the tornado
03:27
seems to be
03:28
far away but you can see it slowly
03:31
turning
03:32
and this tornado is kind of far away so
03:34
it's a little difficult to see
03:36
but uh sometimes you can see
03:39
like just the the top part of the
03:42
tornado
03:42
you can see it beginning to form it's
03:44
like a little bowl
03:46
and it starts to grow longer and longer
03:48
until the
03:50
we call it the funnel
03:55
grows until it touches the ground and
03:57
when it touches the ground that's a lot
03:58
of force there
03:59
and it's blowing things around it's so
04:02
strong it can blow cars around it can
04:05
blow
04:05
cows around it blew dorothy's house
04:09
all the way to the land of oz in the
04:12
book
04:12
the wizard of oz check it out it's very
04:15
it's a very good story
04:16
it's also a good movie um but anyway
04:19
tornado is a very
04:20
strong wind and we have to be careful
04:23
about tornadoes
04:24
okay next we have hurricane
04:28
now hurricanes what's worse a tornado
04:31
or a hurricane well a tornado only lasts
04:35
for a short time
04:36
but it can cause a lot of damage in its
04:40
small
04:40
path a tornado has a small path if
04:43
you're like
04:44
one kilometer or two kilometers to the
04:46
side either way
04:48
and the tornado goes between you there's
04:50
no problem
04:51
but a hurricane is huge and a hurricane
04:55
lasts for a long time like many days
04:59
when it hits land of course it it loses
05:02
its power
05:03
but a hurricane can last for days so a
05:05
hurricane is
05:06
worse than a tornado because it affects
05:09
a
05:10
larger area and it lasts for a much
05:13
longer time so a hurricane is a very
05:16
large storm
05:18
that has fast winds and lots of rain
05:21
but the fast winds are what we have to
05:23
be careful of
05:25
and we've seen in the news about
05:27
hurricanes especially
05:29
in the past that have really damaged big
05:32
cities like there's a famous hurricane
05:34
hurricane katrina
05:36
which really damaged new orleans and
05:39
areas around there
05:40
there's another difference though
05:42
between a hurricane
05:43
and a tornado hurricanes
05:46
happen over water over the ocean or a
05:50
sea tornadoes happen
05:53
over land okay so tornadoes will happen
05:57
in
05:57
kansas colorado uh areas where there
06:01
isn't a lot of water but it's just very
06:04
flat land
06:05
and there's a place i think it's in
06:06
oklahoma it's called tornado
06:09
alley where tornadoes every year
06:12
there's a very good chance for a tornado
06:14
to come through this area it's called
06:16
tornado alley
06:17
but there's no water nearby but
06:20
off the coast right hurricanes form over
06:23
the ocean
06:24
and then they move into land and then
06:26
they cause a lot of damage on the
06:28
coastal cities
06:29
you don't have to worry about a
06:30
hurricane if you're in kansas or
06:32
colorado
06:32
in the middle of the country of america
06:36
because hurricanes you know by the time
06:38
they get there
06:39
they lose all their power so they get
06:41
their power over water
06:43
and they move on to land so a couple of
06:46
differences between hurricanes
06:48
and tornadoes a flood
06:51
now a flood is what happens hurricanes
06:53
cause flood
06:54
because there's a lot of rain coming
06:56
down and there's a lot of wind and it
06:58
pushes sometimes it pushes the sea water
07:00
into a low area and of course it's
07:03
raining a lot so it dumps a lot of water
07:05
onto the area as well so a flood of
07:09
course is a large amount of water
07:10
covering an area that is usually dry
07:14
and we can see this of course in many
07:16
cities unfortunately around the world
07:19
bangladesh has a very serious flooding
07:22
problem
07:22
they get a lot of hurricanes i believe
07:24
they call them cyclones over there
07:27
and because bangladesh
07:30
is very low country there's not a lot of
07:32
hills or mountains in bangladesh it's
07:34
very low
07:35
uh near the sea level so it pushes the
07:37
sea water
07:38
into the land and also again it dumps a
07:41
lot of rain
07:42
and so a lot of areas in bangladesh are
07:45
affected by flooding almost every year
07:47
and of course many other regions of the
07:50
uh earth as well are affected by
07:52
hurricanes
07:53
and flooding it's a disaster okay
07:58
next we have hibernate hibernate do you
08:01
hibernate sometimes i'm sure
08:03
you wish you could hibernate that just
08:06
means to sleep for a very long time
08:08
actually to sleep all winter for some
08:11
animals to spend
08:12
all winter sleeping of course when we
08:15
talk about hibernate and we're talking
08:17
about animals
08:18
animals only hibernate in winter they
08:20
don't hibernate in spring
08:22
summer or fall only in the winter why
08:26
because there's not a lot of food in the
08:29
winter
08:29
consider the bear in his cave bears are
08:33
famous for hibernating
08:34
they go into a cave or somewhere
08:36
underground and they sleep for several
08:38
months
08:39
why do they do that because the land is
08:42
frozen it's covered with snow
08:44
there's not much food for the bear to
08:47
find and it's also
08:48
difficult for the bear a large animal to
08:51
move around in the snow
08:52
it has to use up a lot of energy it
08:55
can't find enough food to
08:56
to replace that energy so it just says
08:59
forget it i'm going to sleep
09:01
and it goes to sleep during the winter
09:04
months and then in the spring
09:06
it wakes up and it comes out you do not
09:08
want to be
09:10
near a bear in the spring that just came
09:13
out of hibernation
09:14
it's very hungry okay so
09:17
so the bear will come out when the snow
09:19
is gone and it can find
09:21
food easily okay
09:25
destroy destroy means to damage
09:28
something
09:29
so that it cannot be used again now you
09:32
can
09:32
damage something a little bit right if
09:34
you hit something and put a dent
09:36
in for example a car you've damaged the
09:39
car
09:40
but you didn't destroy it destroy is
09:43
when
09:44
there's so much damage that the thing
09:47
for example the car cannot be used
09:50
anymore
09:51
it cannot be used again it doesn't work
09:54
and that's you know if a car
09:55
hits a wall at a very high speed the car
09:58
will be broken
09:59
it is destroyed okay so yeah be careful
10:02
don't damage things obviously
10:04
but destroy just means that to damage
10:06
something so much
10:08
that you can't use it again so it's very
10:10
severe damage
10:12
okay those are our words for this lesson
10:16
let's move on
10:20
the first main idea of this lesson is
10:23
the changing weather
10:24
and we've talked about some dangerous
10:27
weather
10:28
conditions in the vocabulary remember we
10:30
talked about a blizzard
10:32
a blizzard of course it's very bad
10:34
snowstorm
10:35
with strong winds now we can have a
10:38
snowstorm with no winds and actually
10:40
that's kind of magical really
10:42
it's it's amazing just to it's very calm
10:46
there's no wind and you just see very
10:48
large snowflakes falling
10:50
and if the land is covered with snow and
10:52
you see this kind of weather
10:54
it's very peaceful and it's like magical
10:57
but
10:57
if the wind is blowing very strongly
11:00
that's a little dangerous right
11:02
and the snow's coming right at you
11:05
especially if you're driving a car
11:07
in a blizzard it can be very dangerous
11:10
because then the road gets slippery too
11:12
and it's very difficult to see the road
11:14
ahead of you
11:15
so it's very dangerous you shouldn't
11:17
drive in a blizzard obviously
11:20
and you should stay home in a blizzard
11:22
also because it's very
11:23
difficult to walk around as well
11:26
next we have a thunderstorm and a
11:29
thunderstorm of course as we said is a
11:31
storm with
11:32
heavy rain thunder and
11:35
lightning lightning is the flash of
11:37
light and thunder is a really big
11:39
sound that comes after the flash of
11:42
light
11:43
next we have tornado and we talked about
11:46
a tornado a tornado is a
11:48
spinning area of wind
11:51
and it sometimes it gets so strong that
11:54
it touches down to the ground and when
11:56
it touches
11:56
onto the ground it can cause a lot of
11:59
damage it can destroy things
12:01
because it's spinning very fastly
12:03
tornadoes move actually
12:05
some tornadoes move quickly but some
12:06
tornadoes don't move quickly they're
12:08
kind of slow
12:09
but if they touch a building or they ca
12:11
they can destroy the building they can
12:13
pick up
12:13
cars they can pick up animals they can
12:16
pick up people
12:17
and you do not want to be in a tornado
12:19
okay
12:21
a hurricane is a really large
12:24
storm that starts over warm
12:27
ocean water if the ocean water is warm
12:30
and the conditions are right
12:31
a hurricane will form like i said before
12:34
hurricanes
12:35
form over water and then they move on to
12:38
land and cause a lot of damage to homes
12:41
and cities and towns that are on
12:45
the land tornadoes form over land they
12:48
stay on land they don't go
12:49
over water okay so those are different
12:53
types of changing weather these are
12:55
different types
12:56
of very severe weather conditions
12:59
dangerous weather conditions okay
13:04
next we can talk about clouds and
13:06
weather this is a little more
13:08
calm but you can look up into the sky
13:12
and you can look at the clouds and you
13:14
can tell
13:16
what the weather is like just by looking
13:18
at the clouds in fact
13:19
if you if you get up in the morning you
13:21
look outside the window
13:22
you want to know what the weather's like
13:24
just look at the clouds
13:26
if you see these types of puffy white
13:29
clouds they look like big cotton balls
13:31
floating in the sky they're called
13:34
cumulus cumulus
13:38
cumulus clouds they are dense
13:41
dense means they're thick right they
13:42
look like big cotton balls or
13:44
or maybe vanilla ice cream floating in
13:47
the sky
13:48
and they are white clouds you know that
13:50
you have good weather
13:51
it's not raining you know the sun is
13:53
shining between the clouds
13:55
and it's probably nice and cool
13:58
cool crisp weather i hope okay but
14:01
that's
14:02
good weather okay now if you look up in
14:05
the sky and you don't see
14:06
the cumulus clouds but you see like
14:08
these very thin
14:10
white layer of clouds way high up in the
14:13
sky really high
14:14
we call those stratus stratus they are
14:17
flat
14:17
and they are layered layered means you
14:19
know you have one layer here
14:21
another layer here they're layered on
14:23
top of each other
14:25
if you see that you know that you have
14:27
well obviously it's cloudy you see the
14:29
clouds but you
14:30
also can tell that you're going to have
14:31
dry weather not
14:33
much rain and maybe little humidity
14:36
in the air humidity is
14:40
the amount of moisture in the air
14:44
okay so you have cloudy and dry weather
14:46
if you see the stratus clouds
14:48
now other times you can see these
14:50
different types of clouds now you see
14:51
it's a little bit hard to see the
14:53
difference
14:54
but you know stratus are flat layered
14:56
clouds but
14:57
cirrus cirrus clouds are also very high
15:01
but instead of being flat layered
15:03
they're kind of like
15:04
little thin strips going through the the
15:07
very high blue sky
15:09
they're high obviously when i said that
15:12
they're thin
15:13
thin clouds and they're wispy what does
15:16
wispy mean wispy means that they're
15:19
well wispy is kind of like the opposite
15:21
of dense right
15:23
they're it's like they're almost not
15:26
there
15:27
it's very they're very delicate and you
15:29
can see through them
15:30
right they're wispy and of course if you
15:33
see that
15:33
you know that you will have good weather
15:37
so cirrus clouds seriously good weather
15:41
okay okay serious don't get confused
15:44
right
15:44
sirius is me means i'm not joking right
15:47
but
15:48
cirrus clouds are seriously good weather
15:51
okay the next one oh my god how do you
15:54
pronounce that
15:58
okay this is a little difficult to
16:00
pronounce right but remember we just
16:02
talked about this word
16:03
and you can see that this word is very
16:05
similar so
16:07
we pronounce this word as cumulus
16:10
so we can start with the same uh way
16:13
for okay but i'll slow down okay
16:18
q mulo nymbus q
16:21
q like q like cute oh it's very cute but
16:24
these clouds aren't cute
16:27
cumulonimbus cumulonimbus
16:30
cumulonimbus can you say it quickly okay
16:33
but these clouds are not nice clouds
16:36
they're not like the other three
16:37
where they have nice good weather if you
16:40
see these clouds
16:41
they're heavy they're gray and why are
16:44
they heavy and gray
16:45
because they're filled with moisture
16:48
they're filled with water
16:49
and they just want to dump that water on
16:51
your head
16:52
so if you see these clouds you know that
16:55
bad weather is coming one more time
16:59
cumulonimbus cumulonimbus
17:02
okay good yeah at first glance you're
17:04
like oh my gosh how do i pronounce that
17:07
but it's okay you can do it okay let's
17:10
move on to the story
17:14
okay as usual i will read the story out
17:17
loud you guys repeat after me
17:19
uh in your head or out loud focus on the
17:23
pronunciation
17:24
and also try to review focus on the
17:27
words that we
17:28
went over in the vocabulary section
17:31
are you guys ready let's begin
17:35
as the seasons change the weather
17:38
changes too
17:40
summer is usually hot
17:43
after summer comes fall and
17:46
it is colder after fall
17:50
comes winter winter
17:53
is the coldest season
17:58
in winter blizzards can happen
18:02
some animals hibernate over the winter
18:06
they wake up in spring when there is
18:10
more
18:10
food and it is warmer
18:15
storms can change the weather
18:18
quickly a thunderstorm has
18:22
many dark clouds and lightning
18:25
lightning is like electricity and
18:29
it can kill and destroy things
18:34
lightning makes a sound called thunder
18:38
that is why it is called a thunderstorm
18:45
tornadoes can happen in thunderstorms
18:49
a tornado comes down from the clouds
18:53
the wind moves very quickly in a circle
18:57
if the tornado touches anything
19:01
it can destroy it
19:04
hurricanes are the biggest storms
19:08
the wind is very very fast
19:11
and there is a lot of rain floods
19:14
can happen okay
19:17
that's the reading section
19:21
okay so how is the information in this
19:23
reading passage
19:24
organized well here we have the very
19:27
common organizational pattern
19:29
main idea and details or examples
19:32
that support that main idea what is the
19:35
main idea
19:36
in this passage the main idea is here
19:40
changes in weather cause
19:43
many things to happen well many things
19:47
is very general it's not specific
19:51
what things then we have to support that
19:53
by giving specific
19:55
examples so we have four different
19:57
specific examples
19:59
of the many things that can happen
20:02
well first of all we have winter now
20:05
winter really isn't
20:06
a weather type it's a season but during
20:09
that season the weather does
20:10
change and winter is the coldest season
20:14
right there's a lot of snow
20:15
the temperatures drop so winter is the
20:18
coldest season
20:20
what happens during winter what kinds of
20:23
storms did we
20:24
see in the passage that occur
20:27
during occur or happen during winter
20:30
well of course we saw the storm where a
20:32
lot of snow falls and the
20:34
wind blows very strongly we call those
20:36
storms
20:37
blizzards b l i z
20:40
z a r d s blizzards because there are
20:44
many blizzards
20:46
blizzards can happen and
20:49
some animals say blizzards forget that
20:51
i'm going to sleep
20:53
so if some animals sleep for the whole
20:55
winter there's a special word for that
20:58
what do we call that we call that
21:00
hibernate hypernate
21:05
hibernate and bears hibernate i wish
21:09
i could hibernate some also during the
21:11
winter it's too cold
21:12
and i don't want to drive in the snow
21:14
okay so but anyway unfortunately
21:16
we still go to school and we still go to
21:18
work during the winter
21:20
don't hibernate your mom will be mad
21:22
okay so some animals hibernate
21:25
over the winter okay next
21:28
we have beep our storms with lots of
21:30
lightning when we talked about these
21:32
types of storms and i said you know when
21:34
you see the lightning
21:35
wait because you hear a big sound after
21:37
it and of course that sound is called
21:39
thunder and that's kind of the answer
21:41
right thunderstorms
21:44
thunder thunder it's a
21:47
long word oh no i'm running out of room
21:51
thunderstorms thunderstorms are storms
21:54
with lots of lightning
21:56
and thunder lightning is like
21:58
electricity well it is electricity
22:00
in fact there's a famous story about ben
22:03
franklin
22:04
he's he was a not just a famous american
22:06
politician
22:07
he was also a scientist and a very smart
22:10
person and he flew a kite into a storm
22:14
to capture some of that energy to figure
22:17
out what is electricity
22:19
and he was one of the early scientists
22:21
to figure out electricity
22:23
and to figure out how to use it and
22:25
thanks to him and many other scientists
22:27
we use electricity in our homes and we
22:30
get light
22:31
okay anyway we're talking about storms
22:34
okay the next one is beep can happen in
22:37
thunderstorms so what is beep well many
22:40
things can happen in thunderstorms we
22:42
need more information
22:44
so we have another clue here great
22:47
the wind moves very quickly in a circle
22:50
so the wind is moving very quickly in a
22:52
circle right and they can happen or they
22:54
can form during
22:56
thunderstorms what was it that we read
22:58
about
22:59
we read about tornadoes tor
23:04
tornay doze
23:08
tornadoes and we put s actually put yes
23:11
but i just want to point out that
23:13
tornadoes the dictionary says that
23:16
you can spell the plural of tornadoes
23:19
two ways you don't need an e it's one of
23:21
those words in english where some people
23:23
spell it this way
23:24
other people spell it this way and
23:26
nobody can agree so both ways are
23:28
accepted okay
23:30
so you can either put es or just s
23:33
but again you need to put s because
23:35
we're talking about
23:37
things in general when you're talking
23:38
about something in general
23:40
and it is a count noun make it plural
23:44
and of course sometimes you put an s on
23:45
it sometimes you put an e s
23:47
on it but we have blizzards
23:49
thunderstorms
23:50
tornadoes these are all count nouns
23:53
we're talking about them
23:54
generally so we make them plural and one
23:57
more example of that is over here
23:59
now beep are the biggest storms
24:02
floods can happen so we talked about
24:05
that i compared tornadoes
24:06
with what with hurricanes
24:12
hurricanes
24:14
and here it's already e just put an s oh
24:17
and i'm sorry about that i put a little
24:19
line here i meant to spell
24:21
tornay doze
24:24
that's also okay so both ways are okay
24:27
it doesn't matter
24:27
okay but anyway coming back to
24:29
hurricanes just s on the end
24:31
hurricanes are the biggest storms
24:34
right they're a lot larger and they form
24:37
over warm water
24:38
and they bring all that water to the
24:40
land they dump it on the land
24:42
and what happens we have floods so
24:45
coming back to the main idea
24:47
changes in weather cause many things to
24:50
happen
24:51
snow will fall down very snow will fall
24:54
down
24:54
a lot that's something that can happen
24:56
during the winter in a thunderstorm
24:58
lightning can hit the ground be careful
25:00
it's dangerous
25:02
also tornadoes can form from
25:04
thunderstorms that's another thing that
25:06
can happen
25:07
and hurricanes cause floods and a lot of
25:10
damage
25:11
on land when they hit land so
25:15
obviously we have to be careful in
25:17
severe
25:18
or dangerous weather conditions
25:22
