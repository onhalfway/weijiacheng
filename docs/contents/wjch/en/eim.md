TAPESCRIPT
Paul: I have a great time with my cousins! We all get on really well.
Ben: Really? Do you like the same things?
Paul: Yes, we do. Well, actually Jason, Jamie and I all like going bowling, but Kelly doesn't like that so much. She likes going to the cinema or going to museums.
Ben: Does she go bowling with you at all?
Paul: No, she doesn't.
Ben: What do you all do together, then?
Paul: We go shopping together at weekends, and we go to the internet cafe together.
Ben: What about your sister, Jess? Does she go with you?
Paul: Yeah, sometimes. She works in a shop at the weekends, so she doesn't have a lot of time.

`prove, scientists, mobile, affect, damages, theory`

It seems like the plot of a particularly far-fetched horror film. But some `scientists` sugguest that our love of the `mobile` phone could cause massive food shortages, as the world's harvests fail. They are putting forward the `theory` that radiation given off by mobile phones and other hi-tech gadgets `damages` the bees' navigation systems, preventing the famously home loving species from finding their ways back to their hives. Late last week, some bee-keepers claimed that the phenomenon -- which started in the US, then spread to continental Europe -- was beginning to `affect` Britain as well. Improbable as it may seem, there is no evidence to `prove` the fact.

这似乎是一部特别牵强的恐怖片的情节。但一些科学家认为，随着世界粮食歉收，我们对手机的热爱可能会导致大规模粮食短缺。他们提出了一种理论，即手机和其他高科技设备破坏蜜蜂导航系统所释放的辐射，阻止了这个以热爱家园著称的物种找到重返蜂巢的途径。上周晚些时候，一些养蜂人声称，这种现象-始于美国，然后蔓延到欧洲大陆-也开始影响英国。虽然看起来不太可能，但没有证据可以“证明”这一事实。
