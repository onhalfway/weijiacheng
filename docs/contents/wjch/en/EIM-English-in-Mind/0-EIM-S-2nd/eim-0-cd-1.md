Unit five- Culture im mind - Exercise eight-b
Read the text again and listen. Answer the questions.
Different cultures - different pets
In Britain, about 50% of homes have got a pet. Almost six million people in Britain have got a dog and five million have got a cat. Dogs, cats, birds and fish are the world's favourite pets.

But people in other countries have got different ideas about pets. In Arab countries, for example, dogs are not popular because people believe they aren't clean. And in Africa, very few people have got animals as pets.

- Arab /ˈærəb/ adj. 阿拉伯的 n. 阿拉伯人；阿拉伯马

Some people in China and Japan have got small but noisy pets. They aren't dogs, cats, fish or budgies: they're fighting crickets. These pets are very noisy!

- budgie /ˈbʌdʒi/ n. 虎皮鹦鹉；相思鹦鹉
- fighting cricket /ˈkrɪkɪt/ 斗蟋蟀

The Inuits of northern Canada keep bear cubs, foxes and baby seals. They look after them until the animals grow up.

- cub /kʌb/ n. 幼兽；不懂规矩的年轻人 vi. 生育幼兽
- seal /siːl/ n. 密封；印章；**海豹**；封条；标志 vt. 密封；盖章 vi. 猎海豹

Another example of an unusual pet is the 'Madagascar hissing cockroach'. It's quite big. It's clean and doesn't bite, and it sometimes makes a loud noise. Madagascar hissing cockroaches make good pets for children. In Australia and Indonesia, some people have got 'sugar gliders'. They are marsupials (that means they have got a pocket or 'pouch' for their babies - like a kangaroo) and they 'fly' from tree to tree.

- Madagascar /ˌmædəˈɡæskər/ n. 马达加斯加岛（非洲岛国） hissing /hɪs/ adj. 发出嘶嘶声的 cockroach /ˈkɑːkroʊtʃ/ n. [昆] 蟑螂
- Indonesia /ˌɪndəˈniːʒə/ n. 印尼，印度尼西亚（东南亚岛国）

Wang's from China, and his favourite food is snake. He says there are lots of good dishes, and they've all got snake in them. There are special snake meat restaurants too.

Different places - different lives
Calvin /'kælvɪn/ n. 加尔文（法国神学家）；卡尔文（男子名）
Calvin lives on Vatersay, an island in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. The island is very, very small. It is five kilometres long and five kilometres wide, and there are fewer than 100 people on the island. Calvin's father works as a fisherman. He usually leaves the house before six o'clock in the morning. His mum always spends the day at home. She often does the housework, but that isn't the only thing she does. She teaches Calvin and his three sisters too. Vatersay hasn't got a school, so the children learn at home.
Calvin and his family sometimes watch TV in the evenings, but not very often, because the picture is hardly ever very good.

Mawar
Marwar lives in the village of Kertajaya, West Java. It is 80 kilometres to the city from Mawar's home. And it is a seven kilometre walk to a real school. But Mawar never goes to that school. There is a temporary school in Mawar's village, and that's where she and 100 other pupils have their lessons every day. 'I can't walk seven kilometres to school and back again every day. There are often storms and there is a lot of rain,' Mawar says. 'The school in our village is great. The building is old and it isn't very good. But it means I can always go to school.' Mawar and her family never watch television - they haven't got a TV.
