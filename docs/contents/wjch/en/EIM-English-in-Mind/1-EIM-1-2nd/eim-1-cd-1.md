- CD1T25 Read the text quickly and listen. Check your ideas.
- Remembering Heroes
- Countries, cities and people all have their own heroes. There are different kinds of heroes: politicians, soldiers, film stars, sport stars and musicians. And there are many different ways of remembering them, too. Here are some of the things that we do to make sure that we don't forget our heroes.
- Sometimes we build statues or sculptures of heroes, especially of politicians and soldiers, but sometimes of writers too. Many cities in South America have a statue of Simon Bolivar (he helped lead many South American countries to independence). And the famous Mount Rushmore in the USA remembers four US presidents of the past.
- We often remember soldiers and other people who died in war with a monument, like the Monument to the People's heroes in Beijing, China, or a memorial, like the Eternal Flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Pairs.
- Some countries have a special remembrance day, like the one every January in the USA for Dr Martin Luther King, the human rights leader.
- When Lady Diana Spencer died in 1997, in Paris, many people left flowers and messages near the place where the car accident happened. Now there is a Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park in London.
- Sometimes places are named after famous people: for example, Livepool, in England and Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil both have airports named after local musicians, John Lennon and Tom Jobim.
- In Hollywood, The Walk of Fame has the names of film, TV and music celebrities in stars on the pavement. Very famous celebrities have their handprints, footprints and autographs in concrete at Hollywood's Grauman's Chinese Theatre.
- Different countries and people remember their heroes in different ways, including many ways that are not mentioned here. Perhaps in your country there are some different ways - what are they?

## 23 Unit 4 Making friends - Exercise 1c

- CD1T26 Now read the text again and listen. Put the pictures in the correct order. Write numbers 1-5 in the boxes.
- The ping pong friendship that changed the world
- Many years ago in 1971, the US table tennis team was at the World Championship in Japan. The team from the People's Republic of China was also there. This championship took palce during the days of the Cold War and so the American and the Chinese players didn't even talk to each other.
- Glen Cowan, from the US team, didn't like the situation. One day, he saw a Chinese player and invited him to play. They played together for 15 minutes, and Cowan missed the US bus back to the hotel.
- Then, something surprising happened. One of the Chinese players waved to Cowan from the Chinese bus. He thought for a moment - and then he got on the bus. Bus. But the Chinese players didn't talk to him. Suddenly Zhuang Zedong, three times world champion, came up to Cowan. 'What are you doing?' said the other Chinese players. 'Don't talk to him! Don't make trouble!' Zedong gave Cowan a silk scarf. 'I give you this to show the friendship of the Chinese people to the American people,' he said through a translator. Cowan wanted to give something back, but he didn't have anything with him.
- Then the bus arrived at the hotel. There were lots of reporters - it was big news to see an American and a Chinese player together.
- Later, Cowan bought a T-shirt with a peace flag on it, and he gave it to Zedong. The two men became friends.
- In the same year, the US team got an invitation to visit China, and in February 1972, US President Richard Nixon went to China on a historic visit. Many people say that the two men and their friendship made a better relationship between their countries possible.
