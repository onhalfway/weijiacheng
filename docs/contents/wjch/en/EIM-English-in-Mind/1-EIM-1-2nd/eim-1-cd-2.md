## CD2T1 Unit 7 Exercise 9d

Culture in mind
Read the text and check your ideas.

It’s 2010 outside the gate of a school somewhere in the UK. Some teenagers are talking. One says to another ” I’m tired of jamming after school--it’s really vanilla. Let’s go for a za OK?” Two adults are walking past. They hear what the teenagers are saying but they don’t understand a word. (What the teenagers said was ” I’m tired of hanging around after school--it’s really boring. Let’s go for a pizza.”)

- hanging around 无所事事

This is nothing new--teenagers always invent new words and phrases. They create words for everyday things--words that mean good or parents or bad or good-looking and so on. Look at these different ways of saying good in recent decades:

1960s--groovy (or fab)

1970s--neat

1980s--ace

1990s--wicked

2000s--cool

But of course the words you use depend on your interests your friends the music you listen to and the part of the country you live in. Different groups of teenagers have different likes and dislikes and so they also have different expressions.

So why do teenagers invent new words or invent new meanings for old words? Many people think it’s because they don’t want adults to understand but that probably isn’t true--the real reason is that teenagers like to be creative and play with language so they have fun creating new words.

And what do parents and old people think about it all? Most of them don’t worry about it--after all they had their own special words when they teenagers too. But some adults complain about “teen talk” and get quite annoyed by it. But that’s all part of the fun for the teenagers!
