What British teenagers watch
Claire Woods
Claire is 16. She lives in Godalming in the south of England. She doesn't watch TV every day. She's selective - she chooses which programmes to watch. This is what she says about TV.

'No, I don't watch TV every day. I think it can be a waste of time. My favourite programmes are competitions - like Britain's Got Talent. I always watch that. The people do great things. And that's why I like it a lot. I also watch documentaries - especially about life in other countries, because I really like geography. I sometimes watch cartoons at the weekend. I watch about eight hours of TV a week, I guess. I never watch sports programmes - I don't like them at all. And I hardly ever watch the news.'

CD2T9: Listen to the interview with Paul again. Underline the correct words.

TAPESCRIPT
Claire: Excuse me. Can I ask you some questions, please?

Claire: Where do you live, Paul?
Paul: I live in Sheffield in the north of England.
Claire: OK. Do you watch a lot of TV, Paul?
Paul: Yes, I do. Well, I watch something on TV every day.
Claire: What sort of programmes do you like?
Paul: Erm, I like some of the drama series. My favorites are CSI and Lost. But I also love sports programmes. I watch football on TV, so I watch a lot of television on Saturdays and Sundays.
Claire: Do you like comedies?
Paul: No, not much.
Claire: What about soap operas?
No, I hate them. I think that's really stupid.
Claire: How many hours of a week do you watch TV, Paul?
Paul: Erm, about ten, no, twelve hours of a week, I think. Mostly the weekends.
Claire: Thanks for talking to me, Paul.
Paul: No problem.

## 18 Unit 9 - Exercise 1b

Read the article again and listen. Answer the questions.
1 How does Rick talk to people?
2 What do people do in a triathlon?
3 How does Dick help Rick in a triathlon event?
4 What name do Rick and Dick have when they do a triathlon?
5 How long do they take to finish a triathlon?
6 Dick says:'We think that we always win'. Why does he say that, do you think?

'We never win, but we always win.'
Rick Hoyt is American. He is a wheelchair because he's got cerebral palsy. He can't talk so he uses a computer to communicate with people. Rick is a happy and successful man; he has a job at the University of Boston, and he works in computer studies. Rick loves sport too, and he takes part in marathons and triathlons.
Triathlons? In the triathlon, people swim four kilometres, cycle 180 kilometres and then run a marathon, 42 kilometres. Rick can't run, cycle or swim because he's in a wheelchair. So how can he take part in a triathlon? Rick can take part because he does it with his father, Dick Hoyt. In the running, his father pushed him in his wheelchair. In the swimming, Rick lies in a small boat and Dick swims and pulls him. And in the cycling. Rick sits in a special seat on the front of Dick's bike. Together, they are 'Team Hoyt'.
Of course, Team Hoyt never wins the race. The winner of a triathlon usually finishes in about nine hours. The Hoyts usually take about 14 or 15 hours. 'That's right,' says Dick. 'Rick and I never win. But we think that we always win.'

- Rick Hoyt  /rɪk/ n. 干草堆；扭伤；柴垛；桶架 v. 把……堆成垛；扭伤 n. (Rick) （英、美、德）里克（人名） /hɔit/ n. 霍伊特（男子名）
- cerebral /səˈriːbrəl; ˈserəbrəl/ adj. 大脑的，脑的
- palsy /ˈpɔːlzi/ n. 麻痹，麻痹状态；中风 vt. 麻痹；使瘫痪
- marathon /ˈmærəθən/ n. 马拉松赛跑；耐力的考验 adj. 马拉松式的；有耐力的 vi. 参加马拉松赛跑
- triathlon /traɪˈæθlən/ n. 三项全能运动

Did you know ...?
Team Hoyt's best marathon time is 2 hours and 40 minutes. (The best runners in the world usually run a marathon in about 2 hours and 5 minutes.)

CD2T18
Students read through questions 1 to 6. Check any problems. Go through the first item as an example, if necessary.
Stronger classes: They can answer the questions and then listen and check.

`SHE SAID 'NO'`
One day in December nineteen-fifty-five (1955), Rosa Parks left work in Alabama, USA, got on a bus and sat down. More people got on the bus, and soon it was full. One man didn't have a seat. The bus driver said to Rosa:'Stand up! Give this man your seat!' Rosa was tired after a long day at work. So, she quietly said:'No.' This started something that changed the USA for ever - because Rosa Parks was a 42-year-old black woman, and the man on the bus was white.
When Rosa was a little girl, she walked to school, but the white children took a bus. Rosa saw their bus every day when it went past. 'In those days,' she said, 'there was a white world and a black world. I lived in the black world.' She went to a black school and studied with black children. When Rosa said 'No', she broke the law. The law said a black person had to give their seat to a white person. The police came and took her to prison. Many black people in Alabama were very angry, and they stopped using the buses for a year. Then the law changed, and slowly, things started to change all over the USA.
For the rest of her life, Rosa worked to help black people in the USA. She died on twenty-fifth (25) October two thousand and five (2005), at the age of ninety-two (92).

Host: Hello, and welcome back, and in the next round of our quiz we are looking at important dates, OK?
Woman: Yes, OK.
Host: And here is the first question. Singer Michael Jackson died on the 25th of June. In which year?
Woman: Er, I think it was in 2009.
Host: And 2009 is ... absolutely correct. Jackson died on June the 25th 2009. Well done, Sarah. That's 20 points for you. And here's our next question. When did the first man walk on the moon? Was it a. on July the 20th 1949? b. on July the 20th 1969? or c. on July the 20th 1979?
Woman: Oh, er, the man's name was Neil Armstrong. And I think it was 1979, so 'c'.
Host: Well, Sarah, you're right about Neil Armstrong - but he didn't walk on the moon in 1979, it was on July the 20th 1969. So no points for that, I'm afraid. Don't worry. Let's look at the next question. You can get 40 points this time. This question is about the Olympic Games in Beijing, China. They started on August the 8th and ended on August the 24th. In which year? a. 2004? b. 2006? c. 2008?
Woman: That's easy. It was in 2008.
Host: That's absolutely correct. 40 points for you. The Beijing Olympic Games started on August the 8th and they ended on August the 24th 2008. And now Sarah - 100 points on the all or nothing question. In Alabama, USA, in a famous incident, Rosa Parks did not give her seat to a white man. What year was that?
Woman: Er, oh, I'm not sure! Urn ... was it... 1958?
Host: Oh, I'm sorry, Sarah. It was in 1955, not 1958. Sorry about that, but you get a wonderful prize ...

`The daughter of a lion`
*Perhaps I am not a lion - but I am the daughter of a lion, and I have lion's heart.*
These are the words of Queen Elizabeth Ⅰ (the first), daughter of King Henry Ⅷ (the eighth), and queen of England from fifteen-fifty-eight (1558) to sixteen-oh-three (1603).
Elizabeth's father wanted a son very badly. He married six times, and he had a son. Edward, but Edward died in 1553. After that, Henry's other daughter, Mary, was queen for a few years, and then it was her sister's turn. Elizabeth Ⅰ, **aged** 25, became a great queen.
In 1558, England was in a bad state. People were hungry, and France and Spain wanted to control England. Elizabeth had a good education and was very good at languages. This helped her when she talked to the **ambassadors** from other countries.
She was a very clever woman. She made good decisions, and made England a great country. Her period as queen is called 'The Elizabeth Age'. It was a great time for **adventure** and for **literature** - Sir Francis Drake sailed around the world, and Shakespeare wrote many famous plays and became one of the great writers in history. Elizabeth never married. When she died in 1603, her cousin James Ⅵ of Scotland became king. The next Queen Elizabeth became queen in 1953 - 350 years later.

## 56 Unit 14 - Exercise 1b

CD2T56 Ask students if they know anything about life in the 1960s. Listen to some of their ideas. Tell students they are going to listen to a teenager and his grandmother talking about life in the 1960s and life now. Play the recording while students listen and complete the exercise. Let them compare their answers with a partner before checking answers in open class.

Listen to Dave and his grandmother. They talk about life in the 1960s and life now.

TAPESCRIPT
Grandmother: I think life was great when I was a teenager. Yes, we had a lot of fun. Is it better now? I'm not sure. But it's very different! I think perhaps life is more interesting now - you know, there are computers and DVDs, and things like that. When I was young, of course, a lot of TV was in black-and-white, and we only got programmes in the afternoon and evening! But I think that life is more difficult for today's teenagers - for example, my grandson Dave. His school work - he gets a lot of homework to do, and he's always got tests and exams - it wasn't like that for me. I was freer than him, I think. School life is more difficult now, certainly. But you know, the really big difference? I think people were friendlier in the 60s than they are now.

Dave: I think perhaps that some things are easier now - for example, with mobile phones and the internet, I can talk to my friends any time I want to. But I also know that some things now are difficult for my grandma. I'm sure that now, life is faster than in the 1960s, and I think that's hard for her. I mean, now she's older, so of course things are more difficult - like, going shopping in town, it's hard for her, the streets are very crowded, they're more crowded than before - and there are a lot more cars these days, the roads are much busier than in the 1960s. And I'm sure that things in the shops are more expensive. So perhaps life is worse for her now - but she's a very happy person!

Who talks about these things? Write D (Dave) or G (grandmother)
1 the streets in a town (D)
2 school life ()
3 DVDs ()
4 the shops ()
5 television ()
6 mobile phones ()
