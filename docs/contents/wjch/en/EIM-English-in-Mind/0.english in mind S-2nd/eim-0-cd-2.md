What British teenagers watch
Claire Woods
Claire is 16. She lives in Godalming in the south of England. She doesn't watch TV every day. She's selective - she chooses which programmes to watch. This is what she says about TV.

'No, I don't watch TV every day. I think it can be a waste of time. My favourite programmes are competitions - like Britain's Got Talent. I always watch that. The people do great things. And that's why I like it a lot. I also watch documentaries - especially about life in other countries, because I really like geography. I sometimes watch cartoons at the weekend. I watch about eight hours of TV a week, I guess. I never watch sports programmes - I don't like them at all. And I hardly ever watch the news.'

CD2T9: Listen to the interview with Paul again. Underline the correct words.

TAPESCRIPT
Claire: Excuse me. Can I ask you some questions, please?

Claire: Where do you live, Paul?
Paul: I live in Sheffield in the north of England.
Claire: OK. Do you watch a lot of TV, Paul?
Paul: Yes, I do. Well, I watch something on TV every day.
Claire: What sort of programmes do you like?
Paul: Erm, I like some of the drama series. My favorites are CSI and Lost. But I also love sports programmes. I watch football on TV, so I watch a lot of television on Saturdays and Sundays.
Claire: Do you like comedies?
Paul: No, not much.
Claire: What about soap operas?
No, I hate them. I think that's really stupid.
Claire: How many hours of a week do you watch TV, Paul?
Paul: Erm, about ten, no, twelve hours of a week, I think. Mostly the weekends.
Claire: Thanks for talking to me, Paul.
Paul: No problem.

## 18 Unit 9 - Exercise 1b

Read the article again and listen. Answer the questions.
1 How does Rick talk to people?
2 What do people do in a triathlon?
3 How does Dick help Rick in a triathlon event?
4 What name do Rick and Dick have when they do a triathlon?
5 How long do they take to finish a triathlon?
6 Dick says:'We think that we always win'. Why does he say that, do you think?

'We never win, but we always win.'
Rick Hoyt is American. He is a wheelchair because he's got cerebral palsy. He can't talk so he uses a computer to communicate with people. Rick is a happy and successful man; he has a job at the University of Boston, and he works in computer studies. Rick loves sport too, and he takes part in marathons and triathlons.
Triathlons? In the triathlon, people swim four kilometres, cycle 180 kilometres and then run a marathon, 42 kilometres. Rick can't run, cycle or swim because he's in a wheelchair. So how can he take part in a triathlon? Rick can take part because he does it with his father, Dick Hoyt. In the running, his father pushed him in his wheelchair. In the swimming, Rick lies in a small boat and Dick swims and pulls him. And in the cycling. Rick sits in a special seat on the front of Dick's bike. Together, they are 'Team Hoyt'.
Of course, Team Hoyt never wins the race. The winner of a triathlon usually finishes in about nine hours. The Hoyts usually take about 14 or 15 hours. 'That's right,' says Dick. 'Rick and I never win. But we think that we always win.'

- Rick Hoyt  /rɪk/ n. 干草堆；扭伤；柴垛；桶架 v. 把……堆成垛；扭伤 n. (Rick) （英、美、德）里克（人名） /hɔit/ n. 霍伊特（男子名）
- cerebral /səˈriːbrəl; ˈserəbrəl/ adj. 大脑的，脑的
- palsy /ˈpɔːlzi/ n. 麻痹，麻痹状态；中风 vt. 麻痹；使瘫痪
- marathon /ˈmærəθən/ n. 马拉松赛跑；耐力的考验 adj. 马拉松式的；有耐力的 vi. 参加马拉松赛跑
- triathlon /traɪˈæθlən/ n. 三项全能运动

Did you know ...?
Team Hoyt's best marathon time is 2 hours and 40 minutes. (The best runners in the world usually run a marathon in about 2 hours and 5 minutes.)

CD2T18
Students read through questions 1 to 6. Check any problems. Go through the first item as an example, if necessary.
Stronger classes: They can answer the questions and then listen and check.
