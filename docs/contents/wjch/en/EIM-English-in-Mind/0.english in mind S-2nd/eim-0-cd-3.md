TAPESCRIPT
I took this photo of my family last summer. My
two brothers are on the left - Frank and Tim. Frank's the one with the *curlier* hair and he's a bit shorter than Tim.
That's my sister Anne on the other side - she's standing next to her friend Lisa. You can see they're both tall and they've got the same hair style. Lisa always wears more expensive clothes than Anne, but I think Anne always looks happier.
Then there's Dad here - he's playing cards with Uncle Bill. Dad's younger than Uncle Bill but he looks older and he's a bit fatter. And you can see he's winning the game because he's a better card player.
So that's everyone. Oh, there are the cats too. The big one's called Sandy. She's a bit boring - she just sleeps most of the time. The little one with Uncle Bill is friendlier and more interesting - he's called Pablo.

Answers
2 Tim 3 Lisa 4 Anne 5 Sandy 6 Uncle Bill 7 Dad 8 Pablo
