## Self Introduction

尊敬的各位老师，亲爱的同学们：

大家早上好！我叫Jeff Wei，我来自五年级六班这个团结温暖的大家庭，很荣幸能担任这次的护旗手。
我兴趣爱好广泛，平时除认真学习课内知识外，我还特别喜欢绘画、弹琴、数学和阅读。闲暇时，我总是挤出时间来阅读各类有益书籍，比如天文、历史、军事科学等。我已经读完了《三国演义》、《水浒传》、《百科全书》等。从这些书中，我学到了很多历史、科学知识、同时也学会了很多道理。我更是酷爱动手实践。学习重要，身体更重要，我通过劳逸结合、积极参加各种户外运动来锻炼身体，这样在学习知识扩大自己的眼界同时，不忘保持一个健健康康的身体。

千里之行，始于足下（老子）。我会继续朝着自己的目标努力。谢谢大家！

Dear teachers and schoolmates,

Good morning! My name is Jeff Wei. I'm from Class Six, Grade 5 - a warm and united family. It is my great honor to be the flag bearer this time.

I have a lot of hobbies and interests. Besides study hard, I also like painting, playing the piano, mathematics and reading very much. In my spare time, I always take time to read different kinds of useful books just like astronomy, history and military science and so on. I have read the Three Kingdoms, the Water Margin, the encyclopedia and so on. From these books, I have learned a lot about history, science and a lot of truth. I love doing things. Learning is important, the body is more important. I take part in all kinds of outdoor sports. Thus I can learn much knowledge to expand my vision as well as keeping a healthy and strong body.

The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step! I will continue to work towards my goals. That's all and thank you very much!
