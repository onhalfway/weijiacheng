## Introduction to the Ugly Duckling

Think of a time in your life when you felt **left out** (忽视，不考虑；被遗忘) or different; maybe you were the new kid in your school or your neighborhood, or the only person of your cultural background in your class. Maybe you can remember being **teased** for wearing glasses or braces, or for not being the best at **kickball**. These are all **life experiences** that teach us important lessons about **acceptance and kindness towards** others, and one of the most famous examples of such a lesson in children's **literature** is Danish storyteller Hans Christian Anderson's fairytale 'The Ugly Duckling,' published in 1843.

想想你生命中的某个时刻，你觉得自己被遗忘了，或者与众不同;也许你是学校的新生，也许你是邻居，也许你是班里唯一一个有这种文化背景的人。也许你还记得曾经因为戴眼镜、戴牙套或者踢球技术不太好而被人取笑过。这些都是人生经历，教给我们接受和善待他人的重要经验。在儿童文学中，这类经验最著名的例子之一是丹麦童话作家汉斯•克里斯蒂安•安德森(Hans Christian Anderson) 1843年出版的童话《丑小鸭》(the Ugly Duckling)。

## Story Summary

The story tells of a **plain-looking** little bird (the Ugly Duckling) born in a **barnyard**. His brothers and sisters **as well as** the other birds and animals on the farm **tease** him for being **plain and ugly**, so he **runs off** to live with a **flock** of wild ducks and geese until hunters **shoot down** the flock. Alone again, the Ugly Duckling finds a home with an old woman, but her cat and hen also tease him, so he doesn't stay there long.

这个故事讲的是一只长相普通的小鸟(丑小鸭)出生在谷仓的院子里。他的兄弟姐妹以及农场里其他的鸟和动物都取笑他长得又丑又丑，所以他就跑去和一群野鸭和鹅住在一起，直到猎人把这群野鸭和鹅打下来。又独自一人，丑小鸭和一个老妇人找到了一个家，但是她的猫和母鸡也戏弄他，所以他没有在那里呆很久。

In his **wanderings**, the Ugly Duckling **comes across** a flock of migrating **swans**, and he wishes to join them but can't because he's too young and can't fly well enough. When winter **sets in**, a farmer **rescues** the Ugly Duckling, but the farmer's children and other animals **frighten** him with their noise and teasing, so again, he **flees**. He spends a cold and lonely winter hiding in a **cave** until **springtime**, when the flock of swans comes to the lake near his hiding place.

在他的漫游中，丑小鸭遇到了一群迁徙的天鹅，他想加入他们，但是因为他太小了，飞得不够好，他不能。冬天来临时，一个农夫救了丑小鸭，但是农夫的孩子和其他动物用他们的叫声和戏弄把他吓跑了，所以他又一次逃走了。他躲在洞穴里度过了一个寒冷寂寞的冬天，直到春天，一群天鹅来到了他躲藏的地方附近的湖边。

When the Ugly Duckling **approaches** the swans, he's **delighted** to find that they **accept** him and treat him like one of them. When he looks at his **reflection** in the lake, he **realizes**, to his **astonishment**, that he's **matured** into a beautiful swan himself. When the swans **fly off** from the lake, he **spreads** his wings and joins them, finally having found a family who accepts him.

当丑小鸭走近天鹅时，他很高兴地发现天鹅们接受了他，把他当天鹅一样对待。当他看到自己在湖中的倒影时，令他惊讶的是，他意识到自己已经长成了一只美丽的天鹅。当天鹅从湖里飞走的时候，他展开翅膀，加入了他们，最终找到了一个接受他的家庭。

## Story Analysis

'The Ugly Duckling' is a popular story about **personal transformation** (转化) and **self-image**. It is sometimes said that Anderson wrote the story based on his own experiences as a boy, being teased for the shape of his nose and facial features and for his **social awkwardness**. However, like the Ugly Duckling's transformation from plain to beautiful, Anderson **grew up** to be a world-famous author.

《丑小鸭》是一个关于个人转变和自我形象的通俗故事。人们有时会说，安德森写这个故事是基于他自己小时候的经历，因为他的鼻子形状和面部特征，以及他社交上的尴尬而被取笑。然而，就像丑小鸭从平凡到美丽的转变一样，安德森也成长为一位举世闻名的作家。

**Characteristic** ( 特征；特性；特色) of the fairytale story, Anderson's tale shows a character **overcoming** (克服) a **challenge** and **miraculously** arriving at a happy ending. The Ugly Duckling's transformation might not be magical in the same way we think of magic in stories like 'Cinderella'; there's no fairy **godmother** waving a **wand** to make the Ugly Duckling beautiful, but the magic is in his **self-discovery** and how much being loved and accepted **alters** his appearance **as much as** his **natural** growing up.

作为童话故事的特色，安德森的故事展现了一个人物克服了挑战，奇迹般地获得了一个幸福的结局。丑小鸭的转变也许并不像我们在《灰姑娘》中想象的那样神奇;没有仙女教母挥舞魔杖让丑小鸭变漂亮，但神奇之处在于他的自我发现，以及被爱和被接受对他外貌的改变有多么大，就像他在成长过程中经历的自然变化一样。

Part of the duckling's **struggle** comes from the **treatment** he receives from others, but also from the fact that he simply accepts their **perception** of him and doesn't realize, until he gets a good look at himself, how truly beautiful and wonderful he is. While he transforms into a beautiful swan on the outside, the real transformation **occurs** inside him; only when he finds a group who accepts him at **face-value** does he have the **courage** to examine his own **reflection**. The **moral** of the story teaches us to accept **one another** **no matter** how different we might appear.

小鸭挣扎的部分原因来自于他受到别人的对待，但也来自于他只是接受了别人对他的看法，直到他看清了自己，他才意识到自己是多么的美丽和精彩。当他外表变成一只美丽的天鹅时，真正的变化发生在他的内心;只有当他发现有一群人以表面价值接受他时，他才有勇气审视自己。这个故事的寓意告诉我们，无论我们看起来多么不同，都要彼此接受。
