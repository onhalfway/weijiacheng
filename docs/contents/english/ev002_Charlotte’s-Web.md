- Good night.Good night. Good night!
- Good night.
- Huh? Who said that? Who are you? Where are you? Are you invisible? 啊？是谁？你是谁？你在哪？你能隐身吗？
- No, I'm nocturnal, which means I work at night, when you should be sleeping. Now, I need to concentrate, so, good night. 不，我是夜行者，即你们睡觉的时候，我就出来工作。现在我得集中注意力，那么，晚安了。
- But I can't sleep now! Please, tell me who you are. I'm just really lonely. 但我现在睡不着！求你告诉我你是谁。我觉得非常孤独。
- So I've seen. Look, you seem like a very nice pig. So I'll tell you what. If you go to sleep right now and let me work, we can converse tomorrow. 我看到了。看起来，你是头善良的猪。这么说吧……如果你现在就去睡觉，让我安心工作，明天，我们就能交谈交谈。
- Converse? 交谈？
- I think your word was "chat". 用你的话说就叫“聊天”。
- Oh. Great! All right.喔。好的！太好了。
- Good night! Good night! Good night. Good night.
