- Good night!
- Good night.
- Huh? Who said that?
- Who are you?
- Where are you? Are you invisible?
- No, I'm nocturnal, which means I work at night, when you should be sleeping.
- Now, I need to concentrate, so, good night.
- But I can't sleep now! Please, tell me who are you. I'm just really lonely.
- So I've seen. Look, you seem like a very nice pig. So I'll tell you what. If you go to sleep right now and let me work, we can converse tomorrow.
- Converse?
- I think your word was "chat".
- Oh. Great! All right.
- Good night! Good night! Good night.
- Good night.
